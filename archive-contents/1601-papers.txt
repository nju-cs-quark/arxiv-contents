abstract: In the Landau problem on the two-dimensional plane, magnetic translation of a quantum wave can be induced by an in-plane electric field. The geometric phase accompanying such magnetic translation around a closed path differs from the topological phase of Aharonov and Bohm in two essential aspects: The wave is in direct contact with the magnetic flux and the geometric phase has an opposite sign from the Aharonov-Bohm phase. We show that magnetic translation on the two-dimensional cylinder implemented by the Schr\"odinger time evolution truly leads to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The magnetic field normal to the cylinder's surface is given by a line of magnetic monopoles which can be simulated in cold atom experiments. We propose an extension of the Aharonov-Bohm experiment which can demonstrate the mutually counteracting effect between the local magnetic translation geometric phase and the topological phase of Aharonov and Bohm.

abstract: A quantum state represents neither properties of a physical system nor anyone's knowledge of its properties. The important question is not what quantum states represent but how they are used---as informational bridges. Knowing about some physical situations (its backing conditions), an agent may assign a quantum state to form expectations about other possible physical situations (its advice conditions). Quantum states are objective: only expectations based on correct state assignments are generally reliable. If a quantum state represents anything, it is the objective probabilistic relations between its backing conditions and its advice conditions. This paper offers an account of quantum states and their function as informational bridges, in quantum teleportation and elsewhere.

abstract: In papers published in the 25 years following his famous 1964 proof John Bell refined and reformulated his views on locality and causality. Although his formulations of local causality were in terms of probability, he had little to say about that notion. But assumptions about probability are implicit in his arguments and conclusions. Probability does not conform to these assumptions when quantum mechanics is applied to account for the particular correlations Bell argues are locally inexplicable. This account involves no superluminal action and there is even a sense in which it is local, but it is in tension with the requirement that the direct causes and effects of events are nearby.

abstract: We investigate the steerability of two-qubit Bell-diagonal states under projective measurements by the steering party. In the simplest nontrivial scenario of two projective measurements, we solve this problem completely by virtue of the connection between the steering problem and the joint-measurement problem. A necessary and sufficient criterion is derived together with a simple geometrical interpretation. Our study shows that a Bell-diagonal state is steerable by two projective measurements iff it violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, in sharp contrast with the strict hierarchy expected between steering and Bell nonlocality. We also introduce a steering measure and clarify its connections with concurrence and the volume of the steering ellipsoid. In particular, we determine the maximal concurrence and ellipsoid volume of Bell-diagonal states that are not steerable by two projective measurements. Furthermore, we explore the steerability of Bell-diagonal states under three projective measurements. A simple sufficient criterion is derived, which can detect the steerability of many states that are not steerable by two projective measurements. Finally, we generalize some of our results to arbitrary two-qubit states. Our study offers valuable insight on steering of Bell-diagonal states as well as the connections between entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality.

abstract: Integrated quantum optics has drastically reduced the size of table-top optical experiments to the chip-scale, allowing for demonstrations of large-scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation. However, despite these advances, practical implementations of quantum photonic circuits remain limited because they consist of large networks of waveguide interferometers that path encode information which do not easily scale. Increasing the dimensionality of current quantum systems using higher degrees of freedom such as transverse spatial field distribution, polarization, time, and frequency to encode more information per carrier will enable scalability by simplifying quantum computational architectures, increasing security and noise tolerance in quantum communication channels, and simulating richer quantum phenomena. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for photonic quantum information processing using waveguide quantum circuit building blocks based on the transverse spatial mode degree of freedom: mode multiplexers and mode beamsplitters. A multimode waveguide is inherently a densely packed system of spatial and polarization modes that can be coupled by perturbations to the waveguide. We design a multimode waveguide consisting of three spatial modes (per polarization) and a nanoscale grating beamsplitter to show tunable quantum interference between pairs of photons in different transverse spatial modes. We also cascade these structures and demonstrate NOON state interferometry within a multimode waveguide. These devices have potential to perform transformations on more modes and be integrated with existing architectures, providing a scalable path to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and entanglement.

abstract: In this paper, the Wigner function of two-mode qubit and qutrit like entangled coherent states (ECS's) is investigated. We use the displacement operator together with parity operation to construct the superposition of two coherent states. By transmitting this superposition from 50-50 beam splitter the two-mode qubit like ECS is generated. Moreover, we introduce a controllable method for producing qutrit like ECS using atom-field interaction in cavity QED and beam splitter. We will show that the distances of peaks of Wigner functions for two-mode ECS's are entanglement sensitive and can be a witness for entanglement. To confirm the results we use concurrence measure to compare bipartite entanglement of ECS's with the behavior of peaks of Wigner functions. Moreover, we investigate decoherence effects on Wigner function, arising from transmitting ECS's through noisy channels.

abstract: The laws of quantum physics place a limit on the speed of computation, in particular the evolution time of a system cannot be arbitrarily fast. Bounds on the speed of evolution for unitary dynamics have been long studied. A few bounds on the speed of evolution for noisy dynamics have also been obtained recently, these bounds, however, are in general not tight. In this article we present a new framework for quantum speed limit of noisy dynamics. With this framework we obtain the exact maximal angle that a noisy dynamics can achieve at any given time, this then provides tight bounds on the evolution time for noisy dynamics. The obtained bound reveals that noisy dynamics are generically different from unitary dynamics, in particular we show that the 'orthogonalization' time, which is the minimum time needed to evolve any state to its orthogonal states, is in general not applicable to noisy dynamics.

abstract: Quantum memories, capable of storing single photons or other quantum states of light, to be retrieved on-demand, offer a route to large-scale quantum information processing with light. A promising class of memories is based on far-off-resonant Raman absorption in ensembles of $\Lambda$-type atoms. However at room temperature these systems exhibit unwanted four-wave mixing, which is prohibitive for applications at the single-photon level. Here we show how this noise can be suppressed by placing the storage medium inside a moderate-finesse optical cavity, thereby removing the main roadblock hindering this approach to quantum memory.

abstract: Photonic sensors have many applications in a range of physical settings, from measuring mechanical pressure in manufacturing to detecting protein concentration in biomedical samples. A variety of sensing approaches exist, and plasmonic systems in particular have received much attention due to their ability to confine light below the diffraction limit, greatly enhancing sensitivity. Recently, quantum techniques have been identified that can outperform classical sensing methods and achieve sensitivity below the so-called shot-noise limit. Despite this significant potential, the use of quantum techniques in plasmonic systems for further improving sensing capabilities is not well understood. Here, we study the sensing performance of a plasmonic interferometer that simultaneously exploits the quantum nature of light and its electromagnetic field confinement. We show that, despite the presence of loss, specialised quantum resources can provide improved sensitivity and resolution beyond the shot-noise limit within a compact plasmonic device operating below the diffraction limit.

abstract: In this paper we consider a three-state variant of the BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. We derive a new lower-bound on the key rate of this protocol in the asymptotic scenario and use mismatched measurement outcomes to improve the channel estimation. Our new key rate bound remains positive up to an error rate of $11\%$, exactly that achieved by the four-state BB84 protocol. This is also a substantial improvement in the tolerated noise over previous lower-bounds for this particular three-state protocol.

abstract: While a bit is the fundamental unit of binary classical information, a qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. In quantum information processing (QIP), it is customary to call the qubits under study as system qubits, and the additional qubits as ancillary qubits. In this thesis, I describe various schemes to exploit the ancillary qubits to efficiently perform many QIP tasks and their experimental demonstrations in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems. Particularly, we have showed that, in the presence of sufficient ancillary qubits, it is possible to completely characterize a general quantum state as well as a general quantum dynamics in a single measurement. In addition, it is also possible to exploit ancillary qubits for realizing noninvasive quantum measurements required for several experiments related to quantum physics. I will also illustrate some interesting applications of ancillary qubits in spectroscopy. At last, I describe an experimental study of the efficiency of various dynamical decoupling sequences for suppressing decoherence of single as well as multiple quantum coherences on large spin-clusters. The experiments reveal the superior performance of the recently introduced RUDD sequences in suppressing decoherence.

abstract: We study on the tripartite entanglement dynamics when each party is initially entangled with other parties, but they locally interact with their own non-Markovian environment. First, we consider three GHZ-type initial states, all of which have GHZ symmetry provided that the parameters are chosen appropriately. However, this symmetry is broken due to the effect of environment. The corresponding $\pi$-tangles, one of the tripartite entanglement measure, are analytically computed at arbitrary time. The revival phenomenon of entanglement occurs after complete disappearance of entanglement. We also consider two W-type initial states. The revival phenomenon also occurs in this case. On the analytical ground the robustness issue against the effect of environment is examined for both GHZ-type and W-type initial states.

abstract: We present Bell-type tests of nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity for single-mode fields employing a generalized quasiprobability function. Our nonclassicality tests are based on the observation that two orthogonal quadratures in phase space (position and momentum) behave as independent realistic variables for a coherent state. Taking four (three) points at the vertices of a rectangle (right triangle) in phase space, our tests detect every pure nonclassical Gaussian state and a range of mixed Gaussian states. These tests also set an upper bound for all Gaussian states and their mixtures, which thereby provide criteria for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity. We optimize the non-Gaussianity tests by employing a squeezing transformation in phase space that converts a rectangle (right triangle) to a parallelogram (triangle), which enlarges the set of non-Gaussian states detectable in our formulation. We address fundamental and practical limits of our generalized phase-space tests by looking into their relation with decoherence under a lossy Gaussian channel and their robustness against finite data and nonoptimal choice of phase-space points. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our parallelogram test can identify useful resources for nonlocality testing in phase space.

abstract: Scalable photonic quantum technologies require on-demand single-photon sources with simultaneously high levels of purity, indistinguishability, and efficiency. These key features, however, have only been demonstrated separately in previous experiments. Here, by s-shell pulsed resonant excitation of a Purcell-enhanced quantum dot-micropillar system, we deterministically generate resonance fluorescence single photons which, at pi pulse excitation, have an extraction efficiency of 66%, single-photon purity of 99.1%, and photon indistinguishability of 98.5%. Such a single-photon source for the first time combines the features of high efficiency and near-perfect levels of purity and indistinguishabilty, and thus open the way to multi-photon experiments with semiconductor quantum dots.

abstract: We consider the macroscopic disordered system of free lattice fermions with the one-bodyHamiltonian, which is the d-dimensional Schrodinger operator with ergodic potential. Weassume that the expectation of the entries of the Fermi projection of the Hamiltonian decays exponentially (a typical behavior in the localization regime). We prove that for any dimension d the expectation of entanglement entropy of the cubic block of side length L divided by the surface area of the block has a finite limit as L tends to infinity and we identify the limit. We then prove that for d = 1 the entanglement entropy admits a well defined asymptotic form with probability 1. According to recent numerical results by Pastur L., Slavin V., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113 (2014) 150404, the asymptotic form is not selfaveraging for d = 1, i.e., its fluctuations do not vanish for large L even for an i.i.d. potential. On the other hand, for d >1 and an i.i.d. potential with sufficiently regular probability distribution, we prove that the variance of the entanglement entropy per unit area has a power law decay for large L, i.e., that for d >1 the entanglement entropy per unit area is selfaveraging.

abstract: Ion traps are a promising platform for the implementation of various quantum technologies, particularly quantum simulation. Unfortunately, the entangling gates required for digital quantum simulations rely on the virtual excitation of the motional modes of the trap, making the necessary operations too slow with respect to the system coherence times. In this work, we propose a method of implementing a crucial multiqubit gate, through a scheme of fast two-qubit gates, able to perform in shorter time and with more precision than existing alternatives. Its implementation would enable digital quantum simulations to outperform classical computers without error correction.

abstract: With adiabatic techniques, it is possible to create quantum superposition states with high fidelity while exercising limited control over the parameters of a system. However, because these techniques are slow compared to other timescales in the system, they are usually not suitable for creating highly unstable states or performing time-critical processes. Both of these situations arise in quantum information processing, where entangled states may only be isolated from the environment for a short time and where quantum computers require high-fidelity operations to be performed quickly. Recently it has been shown that techniques like optimal control and shortcuts to adiabaticity may be used to prepare quantum states non-adiabatically with high fidelity. Here we present two examples of how these techniques can be used to create maximally entangled many-body NOON states in one-dimensional Tonks--Girardeau gases.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.00378
abstract: Many delayed-choice experiments based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) have been thought and made to address the fundamental problem of wave-particle duality. Conventional wisdoms long hold that by inserting or removing the second beam splitter (BS2) in a controllable way, microscopic particles (photons, electrons, etc.) transporting within the MZI can lie in the quantum superposition of the wave and particle state as \psi=a_w\psi_wave+a_p\psi_particle. Here we present an alternative interpretation to these delayed-choice experiments. We notice that as all composite devices of MZI including BS2 are purely classical, the inserting and removing operation of BS2 imposes a time-modulated Hamiltonian H_mod(t)=a(t)H_in+b(t)H_out, instead of a quantum superposition of H_in and H_out as H=a_wH_in+b_pH_out, to act upon the incident wave function. Solution of this quantum scattering problem, rather than the long held quantum eigen-problem yields a synchronically time-modulated output wave function as \psi_mod=a(t)\psi_wave+b(t)\psi_particle. As a result, the probability of particle output from the MZI behaves as if they are in the superposition of the wave and particle state when many events over time accumulation are counted and averaged. We expect these elementary but insightful analyses will shed a new light on exploring basic physics beyond the long-held wisdom of wave-particle duality and principle of complementarity.

abstract: We present analytical solutions to three qubits and a single-mode cavity coupling system beyond the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). The zero-th order approximation gives correct solutions when the qubits are far detuned from the cavity. The first order approximation, called generalized rotating-wave approximation (GRWA), produces an effective solvable Hamiltonian with the same form as the ordinary RWA one and exhibits substantial improvements of energy levels over the RWA even on resonance. Based on these analytical eigen-solutions, we study both the bipartite entanglement and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). The dynamics of the concurrence and the GME using the GRWA are in consistent with the numerical ones. Interestingly, the well known sudden death of entanglement occurs in the bipartite entanglement dynamics but not in GME dynamics.

abstract: Endohedral molecular magnets, e.g. as realized in fullerenes containing $\rm DySc_{2}N$, are promising candidates for molecular electronics and quantum information processing. For their functionalization an ultrafast local magnetization control is essential. Using full ab-initio quantum chemistry calculations we predict the emergence of charge current loops in fullerenes with an associated orbital magnetic moment upon irradiation with weak light vortex pulses that transfer orbital angular momentum. The generated current is controllable by the frequency, the vortex topological charge, and the intensity of the light. Numerical and analytical results show that an ultraviolet vortex femtosecond pulse with an intensity $\sim10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$ generates non-invasively nA unidirectional surface current with an associated magnetic field of hundreds $\mu$T at the center of the fullerene.

abstract: We propose a method of construction of a normalized vibrational Hamiltonian of a highly excited molecular system with $n$ degrees of freedom in the case of a a $p:q$ resonance. We present also the counting of all the independent operators and the counting of all the parameters included in the Hamiltonian (Counting theorems 1 to 8). The method introduces, on a systematic way, all the operators, in particular the coupling operators, that can be built from the polynomials formed by products of powers of the generators of a Lie algebra: the algebra of the invariant polynomials built in classical mechanics from the the kernel $Ker \,ad_{\mathcal{H}_{0}}$ of the adjoint operator $ad_{\mathcal{H}_{0}}$ (see [6] or [4],[5]). Application to the non-linear triatomic molecule ClOH is then given, taking into account the Fermi resonance between the O-Cl stretching oscillators and the bending motion. The study of this molecular system in highly excited vibrational states (until almost the dissociation limit) has been realized in [2], with a fit of 725 levels of energy. On the 86 coefficients (among which 31 coupling coefficients) that we count, and completely compatible with [2], the smallest rms value leads to keep only 28 non-zero coefficients. In the appendix, we explain the vocabulary and the strategy employed in order to demonstrate the theorems of coupling operators included in the Hamiltonian.

We observe two-photon interference fringes involving both the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect and the interference of path-entangled two-photon states simultaneously in a single interferometric setup. The observed two-photon interference effect can provide a simultaneous observation of the interferometric properties of the single-photon and two-photon wavepackets

abstract: Matrix product states (MPS) illustrate the suitability of tensor networks for the description of interacting many-body systems: ground states of gapped $1$-D systems are approximable by MPS as shown by Hastings [J. Stat. Mech. Theor. Exp., P08024 (2007)]. In contrast, whether MPS and more general tensor networks can accurately reproduce correlations in critical quantum systems, respectively quantum field theories, has not been established rigorously. Ample evidence exists: entropic considerations provide restrictions on the form of suitable Ansatz states, and numerical studies show that certain tensor networks can indeed approximate the associated correlation functions. Here we provide a complete positive answer to this question in the case of MPS and $2D$ conformal field theory: we give quantitative estimates for the approximation error when approximating correlation functions by MPS. Our work is constructive and yields an explicit MPS, thus providing both suitable initial values as well as a rigorous justification of variational methods.

abstract: We construct a macroscopic thermodynamical theory that satisfies the second law of thermodynamics, based on quantum mechanics. More concretely, our macroscopic theory satisfies the following two features: (1) A macroscopic equilibrium state is expressed as a set of macroscopic variables $\vec{a}=(a_1,\cdots,a_L)$, which represents coarse-grained values of a set of physical quantities, and (2) An adiabatic transformation from an equilibrium state $\vec{a}$ to another state $\vec{a}'$ is possible if and only if $s_{\vec{a}}\le s_{\vec{a}'}$ holds. Here, $s_{\vec{a}}$ is a real-valued function corresponding to the thermodynamical entropy, which depends only on macroscopic variables $\vec{a}$. We show that such a macroscopic thermodynamical theory can be consistently constructed if the von-Neumann entropy of a generalized microcanonical state satisfies a generalized central limit theorem. We also show that even when the von-Neumann entropies do not satisfy the condition, a macroscopic thermodynamic-like theory with a similar structure exists, which could be at the foundations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Finally, we make a replica of $(U,V,N)$ expression of thermodynamics satisfying (1) and (2), using a toy model of free particles in a box.

abstract: In this work, we study the effects of coherent and incoherent transport of energy through two types of configurations of four interacting two-level systems. Both of the configurations are irreversibly attached to the respective reaction centers. For the first type, the dynamics is only coherent, while for the second one the coherent evolution is completely suppressed and the evolution of the system is only incoherent induced from interaction of the system with fluctuating environments. We calculate the efficiency of transport for both of the configurations in the presence of harmonic deformations. It is found that for a special type of deformations, the efficiency of incoherent transport becomes better than the coherent one.

abstract: Using the model of parametric interaction based on the spatio-spectral Schmidt modes and generalized parametric approximation, we analyze coherence and mode structure of ultra-intense twin beams generated in the regime with pump depletion. We show that the increase of spatial and spectral coherence with the increasing pump power observed for moderate powers is replaced by the decrease for the pump powers at which pump depletion occurs. This behavior of coherence is opposed to that exhibited by the number of spatio-spectral modes effectively constituting the twin beam. The conditions for maximal coherence are analyzed considering pump-beam parameters (spectral width, transverse radius). The existence of additional coherence maxima occurring at even higher pump powers is predicted and explained by the oscillatory evolution of the modes' populations.

abstract: Statistical mechanics is founded on the assumption that all accessible configurations of a system are equally likely. This requires dynamics that explore all states over time, known as ergodic dynamics. In isolated quantum systems, however, the occurrence of ergodic behavior has remained an outstanding question. Here, we demonstrate ergodic dynamics in a small quantum system consisting of only three superconducting qubits. The qubits undergo a sequence of rotations and interactions and we measure the evolution of the density matrix. Maps of the entanglement entropy show that the full system can act like a reservoir for individual qubits, increasing their entropy through entanglement. Surprisingly, these maps bear a strong resemblance to the phase space dynamics in the classical limit; classically chaotic motion coincides with higher entanglement entropy. We further show that in regions of high entropy the full multi-qubit system undergoes ergodic dynamics. Our work illustrates how controllable quantum systems can investigate fundamental questions in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

abstract: The desiderata for an ideal photon source are high brightness, high single-photon purity, and high indistinguishability. Defining brightness at the first collection lens, these properties have been simultaneously demonstrated with solid-state sources, however absolute source efficiencies remain close to the 1% level, and indistinguishability only demonstrated for photons emitted consecutively on the few nanosecond scale. Here we demonstrate solid-state photon sources with an absolute brightness at the output of a single-mode fibre of 14% and purities of 97.1--99.0%. Our sources are quantum dots deterministically coupled to micropillar cavities with emission lifetimes of a few hundred picoseconds. When quasi-resontantly excited, they emit long streams of photons that exhibit an indistinguishability up to 70%---above the classical limit of 50%---even after 33 consecutively emitted photons, a 400 ns separation between them. When resonantly excited we observe near-optimal indistinguishability values: 95% at short timescales, remaining above 90% at timescales as large as 160 ns. Our devices bring solid-state emitters into a regime suitable for scalable implementations.

abstract: The general view is that all fundamental physical laws should be formulated within the framework given by quantum mechanics (QM). In a sense, QM therefore has the character of a metaphysical theory. Consequently, if it is possible to derive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general, philosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated epistemic principles. A key assumption is that in a proper physical theory, the introduction of entities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle is in conflict with the theory. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like knowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the potential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges from this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities are defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means that the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of description, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space $\mathcal{S}=\{Z\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These elements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world. The evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution of the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase space. The evolution of $S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\in \mathbf{\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated according to $n\rightarrow n+1$ each time an event occurs, each time potential knowledge changes. Sequential time $n$ can be separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances between events in space-time. There is an entire space-time associated with each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at sequential time $n$ about the temporal relations between present and past events.

abstract: A variety of dynamics in this world can be approximately treated by a model: a driven and damped parametric oscillator. An intensive investigate of this time-dependent model from both classical and quantum mechanical points of view provides a dynamical insight to resolve the classical and quantum dynamics in order to understand the more complicated time-dependent evolutions not only happens in the macroscopic classical scale for the synchronized behaviors but also in the coherent microscopic scale for a quantum state control. By using a Lie transformation on a general time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian, we exactly solve the dynamical behaviors of the driven and damped parametric oscillator to give a universal physical mechanism for the classical parametric control on the quantum state evolution in a dissipation system.

abstract: We present a theoretical formalism for resonance fluorescence radiating from a two-level system (TLS) driven by any periodic driving and coupled to multiple reservoirs. The formalism is derived analytically based on the combination of Floquet theory and Born-Markov master equation. The formalism allows us to calculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are analytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We can systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present formalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to comprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is simultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We demonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the driving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be attributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in terms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and their steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of the fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields in contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the biharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from the result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple resonance conditions. By the three concrete applications, we illustrate that the present formalism provides a routine tool for comprehensively exploring the fluorescence spectrum of periodically strongly driven TLSs.

abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference unveils a distinct behavior of identical particles which cannot be distinguished from each other. Especially for bosons, two separated identical particles passing through a beamsplitter always go together into one of the output ports, but that is not the case with other particles including fermions or classical ones. So far many elemental properties of quantum physics and information have been discovered through the concatenated HOM effects, which has been demonstrated in photons and recently in plasmons, atoms and phonons. However, all demonstrations in optical region employed two particles in different spatial modes. Here we first report the HOM interference between two photons in a single spatial mode with different frequencies (energies) by using a partial frequency conversion. The demonstrated frequency-domain interferometer allows us to replace spatial optical paths by optical frequency multiplexing, which opens up a distinct architecture of the quantum interferometry.

abstract: In [J. Chem. Phys. 143, 054102 (2015)] I have derived conditions to characterize the kernel of the retarded response function, under the assumption that the initial state is a ground state. In this article I demonstrate its generalization to mixed states (ensembles). To make the proof work, the weights in the ensemble need to be decreasing for increasing energies of the pure states from which the mixed state is constructed. The resulting conditions are not easy to verify, but under the additional assumptions that the ensemble weights are directly related to the energies and that the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian participates in the ensemble, it is shown that potentials only belong to the kernel of the retarded response function if they commute with the initial Hamiltonian. These additional assumptions are valid for thermodynamic ensembles, which makes this result also physically relevant. The conditions on the potentials for the thermodynamic ensembles are much stronger than in the pure state (zero temperature) case, leading to a much less involved kernel when the conditions are applied to the retarded one-body reduced density matrix response function.

abstract: We consider a scheme of multiplexed cold atomic ensembles that generate a frequency-entangled biphoton state with controllable entropy of entanglement. The biphoton state consists of a telecommunication photon (signal) immediately followed by an infrared one (idler) via four-wave mixing with two classical pump fields. Multiplexing the atomic ensembles with frequency and phase-shifted signal and idler emissions, we can manipulate and control the spectral property of the biphoton state. Mapping out the entropy of entanglement in the scheme provides the optimal configuration for entanglement resources. This paves the way for efficient long-distance quantum communication and for potentially useful multimode structures in quantum information processing.

abstract: Quantum mechanical objects or nanoobjects have been proposed as bits for information storage. While time-averaged properties of magnetic, quantum-mechanical particles have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, experimental investigations of the real time evolution of magnetization in the quantum regime were not possible until recent developments in pump-probe techniques. Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of effective spin systems by means of analytical and numerical treatments. Particular attention is paid to the quantum revival time and its relation to the magnetization tunneling. The quantum revival time has been initially defined as the recurrence time of a total wave-function. Here we show that the quantum revivals of wave-functions and expectation values in spin systems may be quite different which gives rise to a more sophisticated definition of the quantum revival within the realm of experimental research. Particularly, the revival times for integer spins coincide which is not the case for half-integer spins. Furthermore, the quantum revival is found to be shortest for integer ratios between the on-site anisotropy and an external magnetic field paving the way to novel methods of anisotropy measurements. We show that the quantum tunneling of magnetization at avoided level crossing is coherent to the quantum revival time of expectation values, leading to a connection between these two fundamental properties of quantum mechanical spins.

abstract: We consider two separate atoms interacting with a single-mode optical resonator. When the frequency of the resonator field is twice the atomic transition frequency, we show that there exists a resonant coupling between \textit{one} photon and \textit{two} atoms, via intermediate virtual states connected by counter-rotating processes. If the resonator is prepared in its one-photon state, the photon can be jointly absorbed by the two atoms in their ground state which will both reach their excited state with probability close to one. Like ordinary quantum Rabi oscillations, this process is coherent and reversible, so that two atoms in their excited state will undergo a downward transition jointly emitting a single cavity photon. This joint absorption and emission processes can also occur with three atoms. The parameters used to investigate this process correspond to experimentally demonstrated values in circuit quantum electrodynamics systems.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is an intermediate type of quantum nonlocality which lies between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. It is interesting to know what kind of states can generate EPR nonlocal correlations in the simplest nontrivial scenario, that is, two projective measurements for each party that share a two-qubit state. In this paper we settle this problem by deriving a necessary and sufficient analytical criterion. It turns out that a two-qubit state can demonstrate EPR nonlocal correlations in this scenario iff it can demonstrate Bell nonlocal correlations. This phenomenon is in sharp contrast with the strict hierarchy expected between the two forms of nonlocality. However, the strict hierarchy can emerge if both parties are restricted to performing mutually unbiased measurements. In addition, we clarify the relationships between entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality. In our study, we introduce the concept of restricted local hidden state models, which is useful in connecting different steering scenarios and is of interest in a wider context.

abstract: We show that the most general protocol of quantum communication between two end-points of a quantum network with arbitrary topology can be reduced to an ensemble of Choi matrices subject to local operations and classical communication. This is found by using a teleportation-based technique which applies to a wide range of quantum channels both in discrete- and continuous-variable settings, including lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels. Thanks to this reduction, we compute the optimal rates (capacities) at which two end-points of a quantum network can transmit quantum information, distil entanglement, or distribute secret keys. These capacities are all bounded or equal to a single quantity, that we call the entanglement flux of the quantum network. As a particular case, we derive these optimal rates for the basic paradigm of a linear chain of quantum repeaters. Thus our results establish the ultimate rates for repeater-based and network-assisted quantum communications under the most relevant models of noise and decoherence.

abstract: We show that the minimum Renyi entropy output of a quantum channel is locally additive for Renyi parameter alpha>1. While our work extends the results of [10] (in which local additivity was proven for alpha=1), it is based on several new techniques that incorporate the multiplicative nature of p-norms, in contrast to the additivity property of the von-Neumann entropy. Our results demonstrate that the counterexamples to the Renyi additivity conjectures exhibit global effects of quantum channels. Interestingly, the approach presented here can not be extended to Renyi entropies with parameter alpha<1.

abstract: In the last decade, efforts have been made to reconcile theoretical security with realistic imperfect implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD). However, in the process gaps have recently emerged between academic and industrial approaches to closing loopholes created by implementation imperfections. In academic research labs, many practical security problems appear to be reliably solved, in principle, by advanced schemes and protocols. Meanwhile the industry prefers practical and easier solutions, even without security verification in some cases. In this paper, we present a concrete example of ID Quantique's random-detector-efficiency countermeasure against detector blinding attacks. As a third-party tester, we have found that the first industrial implementation of this countermeasure is effective against the original blinding attack, but not immune to a modified blinding attack. Moreover, we show experimentally that the full countermeasure as in academic proposal [C. C. W. Lim et al., IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quantum Electron. 21, 6601305 (2015)] is still vulnerable against the modified blinding attack. Our testing results show several specific disparities between the industrial practical solution and the academic perfect solutions. Our work illustrates that forming an implementation-and-testing closed loop is necessary to bridge the gaps and improve the practical security of QKD systems.

abstract: Here we review the many interesting aspects and distinct phenomena associated to quantum dynamics on general graph structures. For so, we discuss such class of systems under the energy domain Green's function ($G$) framework. Such approach is particularly interesting because $G$ can be written as a sum over classical-like paths, where local quantum effects are taking into account through the scattering matrix amplitudes (basically, transmission and reflection coefficients) defined on each one of the graph vertices. So, the {\em exact} $G$ has the functional form of a generalized semiclassical formula, which through different calculation techniques (addressed in details here) always can be cast into a closed analytic expression. This allows to solve exactly arbitrary large (although finite) graphs in a recursive and fast way. Using the Green's function method, we survey many properties for open and closed quantum graphs, like scattering solutions for the former and eigenspectrum and eigenstates for the latter, also addressing quasi-bound states. Concrete examples, like cube, binary trees and Sierpi\'nski-like, topologies are considered. Along the work, possible distinct applications using the Green's function methods for quantum graphs are outlined.

abstract: Light with phase front carrying an orbital angular momentum (OAM) is useful in many fields, such as optical tweezers, astronomy. In optical communication, light encoded information in its OAM degrees of freedom enables networks to carry significantly more information and increase their capacity significantly. However, light with OAM has a difficulty in propagating in commercial optical fibers, while light in Gaussian mode encoded with time-bin is most suitable for transmission in fiber. Therefore it is crucially important to build up a bridge for interfacing lights with OAM and time-bin. Here, we report the realization of a photonic space-time transcoder, by which light with an arbitrary OAM superposition is experimentally converted into a time-bin Gaussian pulse and vice versa in principle. Furthermore, we clearly demonstrate that the coherence is conserved very well and there is no crosstalk between orthogonal modes. Such a photonic device is simple and theoretically can be built up in a scalable architecture. Our experimental demonstration paves a primary step towards mixed optical communication in free-space and optical fibre.

abstract: Interferometry using discrete energy levels in nuclear, atomic or molecular systems is the foundation for a wide range of physical phenomena and enables powerful techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, Ramsey-based spectroscopy and laser/maser technology. It also plays a unique role in quantum information processing as qubits are realized as energy superposition states of single quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate quantum interference of different energy states of single quanta of light in full analogy to energy levels of atoms or nuclear spins and implement a Ramsey interferometer with single photons. We experimentally generate energy superposition states of a single photon and manipulate them with unitary transformations to realize arbitrary projective measurements, which allows for the realization a high-visibility single-photon Ramsey interferometer. Our approach opens the path for frequency-encoded photonic qubits in quantum information processing and quantum communication.

abstract: The influence of photon-momentum recoil on adiabatic population transfer in an atomic three-level lambda system is studied. It is shown that the Doppler frequency shifts, due to atomic motion can play an important role in adiabatic population transfer processes of atomic internal states by a pair of laser fields. For the limiting case of slow atoms ( Doppler shift much smaller than the photon recoil energy) the atoms occupy the same target state regardless of the order of switching of laser fields, while for the case of fast atoms interacting with the intuitive sequence of pulses, the target state is the intermediate atomic state. It is shown that these processes are robust with respect to parameter fluctuations, such as the laser pulse area and the relative spatial offset (delay) of the laser beams. The obtained results can be used for the control of temporal evolution of atomic populations in atomic beams by externally adjustable Doppler shifts.

abstract: We examine the effect of network heterogeneity on the performance of quantum search algorithms. To this end, we study quantum search on a tree for the oracle Hamiltonian formulation employed by continuous-time quantum walks. We use analytical and numerical arguments to show that the exponent of the asymptotic running time $\sim N^{\beta}$ changes uniformly from $\beta=0.5$ to $\beta=1$ as the searched-for site is moved from the root of the tree towards the leaves. These results imply that the time complexity of the quantum search algorithm on a balanced tree is closely correlated with certain path-based centrality measures of the searched-for site.

abstract: There are several inequalities in physics which limit how well we can process physical systems to achieve some intended goal, including the second law of thermodynamics, entropy bounds in quantum information theory, and the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Recent results provide physically meaningful enhancements of these limiting statements, determining how well one can attempt to reverse an irreversible process. In this paper, we apply and extend these results to give strong enhancements to several entropy inequalities, having to do with entropy gain, information gain, and complete positivity of physical evolutions. Our first result is a remainder term for the entropy gain of a quantum channel. This result implies that a small increase in entropy under the action of a unital channel is a witness to the fact that the channel's adjoint can be used as a recovery channel to undo the action of the original channel. We apply this result to pure-loss, quantum-limited amplifier, and phase-insensitive quantum Gaussian channels, showing how a quantum-limited amplifier can serve as a recovery from a pure-loss channel and vice versa. Our second result regards the information gain of a quantum measurement, both without and with quantum side information. We find here that a small information gain implies that it is possible to undo the action of the original measurement if it is efficient. The result also has operational ramifications for the information-theoretic tasks known as measurement compression without and with quantum side information. We finally establish that the reduced dynamics of a system-environment interaction are approximately CPTP if and only if the data processing inequality holds approximately.

abstract: On the basis of the quantum Zeno effect it has been recently shown [D. K. Burgarth et al., Nat. Commun. 5, 5173 (2014)] that a strong amplitude damping process applied locally on a part of a quantum system can have a beneficial effect on the dynamics of the remaining part of the system. Quantum operations that cannot be implemented without the dissipation become achievable by the action of the strong dissipative process. Here we generalize this idea by identifying decoherence-free subspaces (DFS's) as the subspaces in which the dynamics becomes more complex. Applying methods from quantum control theory we characterize the set of reachable operations within the DFS's. We provide three examples which become fully controllable within the DFS's while the control over the original Hilbert space in the absence of dissipation is trivial. In particular, we show that the (classical) Ising Hamiltonian is turned into a Heisenberg Hamiltonian by strong collective decoherence, which provides universal quantum computation within the DFS's. Moreover we perform numerical gate optimization to study how the process fidelity scales with the noise strength. As a byproduct a subsystem fidelity which can be applied in other optimization problems for open quantum systems is developed.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.01214
abstract: Two kinds of results regarding local properties of entanglement are given in this work and applied to the problem of collapse: 1. Strong cluster properties of local entanglement in a macroscopic system result directly from the Schr\"odinger equation when there is interaction with another system. These properties, which cannot be expressed by observables, are nevertheless associated with well-defined local probabilities, though different from standard quantum probabilities. They evolve with a finite velocity under nonlinear wave equations, until complete entanglement between the two systems. 2. When these local properties are extended to the interactions of a macroscopic system with its environment, and especially to fluctuations in these interactions, they induce a substantial level of incoherence in the quantum state of the system. These properties of clustering and of incoherence can combine together during a quantum measurement, to generate an explicit mechanism of random collapse in which randomness derives from incoherence and the associated outcomes of collapse are governed by Born's probability rule. Although these results are partly conjectural, they seem suggestive enough for proposing their trend as a renovated strategy for approaching the collapse problem.

abstract: Quantum correlations in a physical system are usually studied with respect to a unique (fixed) decomposition of the system into subsystems, without fully exploiting the rich structure of the state-space. Here, we show several examples in which the consideration of different ways to decompose a physical system enhances the quantum resources and accounts for a more flexible definition of quantumness-measures. Furthermore, we give a new perspective regarding how to reassess the fact that local operations play a key role in general quantumness-measures that go beyond entanglement --as discord-like ones. We propose a way to quantify the maximum quantumness of a given state. Applying our definition to low-dimensional bipartite states, we show that different behaviours are reported for separable and entangled states than those corresponding to the usual measures of quantum correlations. We show that there is a close link between our proposal and the criterion to witness quantum correlations based on the rank of the correlation matrix, proposed by Daki\'c, Vedral and Brukner.

abstract: It has been found that Markovian quantum dissipative processes, described by the Lindblad equation, may have attractive steady-state manifolds, in which dissipation and decoherence can play a positive role to quantum information processing. In this article, we show that such attractive steady-state manifolds with the same positive features as in Markovian dissipative processes can exist in the non-Markovian dissipative processes. Our finding indicates that the dissipation-assisted schemes implemented in the Markovian systems can be directly generalized to the non-Markovian systems.

abstract: Systems that are driven out of thermal equilibrium typically dissipate random quantities of energy on microscopic scales. Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the distribution of these random work costs with the corresponding distribution for the reverse process. By an analysis that explicitly incorporates the energy reservoir that donates the energy, and the control system that implements the dynamic, we here obtain a quantum generalization of Crooks theorem that not only includes the energy changes on the reservoir, but the full description of its evolution, including coherences. This approach moreover opens up for generalizations of the concept of fluctuation relations. Here we introduce `conditional' fluctuation relations that are applicable to non-equilibrium systems, as well as approximate fluctuation relations that allow for the analysis of autonomous evolution generated by global time-independent Hamiltonians.

abstract: We rigorously establish an Arrhenius law for the mixing time of quantum doubles based on any Abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_d$. We have made the concept of the energy barrier therein mathematically well-defined, it is related to the minimum energy cost the environment has to provide to the system in order to produce a generalized Pauli error, maximized for any generalized Pauli errors, not only logical operators. We evaluate this generalized energy barrier in Abelian quantum double models and find it to be a constant independent of system size. Thus, we rule out the possibility of entropic protection for this broad group of models.

abstract: We report on experimentally observed addition, subtraction and cancellation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the process of parametric four-wave mixing that results in frequency up- and down-converted emission in Rb vapour. Specific features of OAM transfer from resonant laser fields with different optical topological charges to the spatially and temporally coherent blue light have been considered. We have observed the conservation of OAM in nonlinear wave mixing in a wide range of experimental conditions including a non-collinear geometry of the applied laser beams and furthermore that the coherent blue light accumulates the total orbital angular momentum of the applied laser light. Spectral and power dependences of vortex and plane wave front blue light beams have been compared.

abstract: One of the very first applications of the quantum field theoretic vacuum state was in the development of the notion of Casimir energy. Now field theoretic Casimir energies, considered individually, are always infinite. But differences in Casimir energies are quite often finite --- a fortunate circumstance which luckily made some of the early calculations, (for instance, for parallel plates and hollow spheres), tolerably tractable. We shall explore the extent to which this observation can be systematised. For instance: What are necessary and sufficient conditions for Casimir energy differences to be finite? When the Casimir energy differences are not finite, can anything useful be said? We shall see that it is the difference in the first few Seeley-DeWitt coefficients that is central to answering these questions. In particular, for any collection of conductors (perfect or imperfect) and/or dielectrics, as long as one merely moves them around without changing shape or volume, then the Casimir energy difference (and so the Casimir forces) are guaranteed finite.

abstract: Squeezed state of light is one of the important subjects in quantum optics which is generated by optical nonlinear interactions. In this paper, we especially focus on qubit like entangled squeezed states (ESS's) generated by beam splitters, phase-shifter and cross Kerr nonlinearity. Moreover the Wigner function of two-mode qubit and qutrit like ESS are investigated. We will show that the distances of peaks of Wigner functions for two-mode ESS are entanglement sensitive and can be a witness for entanglement. Unlike the qubit cases, it is shown that there are qutrit like ESS violating monogamy inequality. These trends are compared with those obtained for qubit and qutrit like entangled coherent state (ECS).

abstract: We provide several examples and an intuitive diagrammatic representation demonstrating the use of two-qubit unitary transformations for mapping coupled spin Hamiltonians to simpler ones and vice versa. The corresponding dualities may be exploited to identify phase transition points or to aid the diagonalization of such Hamiltonians. For example, our method shows that a suitable one-parameter family of coupled Hamiltonians whose ground states transform from an initially factorizing state to a final cluster state on a lattice of arbitrary dimension is dual to a family of trivial decoupled Hamiltonians containing local on-site terms only. As a consequence, the minimum enery gap (which determines the adiabatic run-time) does not scale with system size, which facilitates an efficient and simple adiabatic preparation of e.g. the two-dimensional cluster state used for measurement-based quantum computation.

abstract: With the purpose to devise a novel lasing scheme, we consider a two level system with both a transversal and longitudinal coupling to the electromagnetic field. If the longitudinal coupling is sufficiently strong, multi-photon transitions become possible. We assume furthermore that the electromagnetic environment has a spectrum with a single sharp resonance, which serves as a lasing cavity. Additionally, the electromagnetic environment should have a very broad resonance around a frequency which differs form the sharp resonance. We use the polaron transformation and derive a rate equation to describe the dynamics of such system. We find that lasing at the frequency of the sharp mode is possible, if the energy difference of the atomic transition is similar to the sum of the frequencies of both peaks in the spectral function. This allows for the creation of lasing over a large frequency range and may in perspective enable THz lasing at room temperature.

abstract: A theoretical investigation on slow light propagation based on eletromagnetically induced transparency in a three-level quantum-dot system is performed including non-Markovian effects and correlated dephasing reservoirs. It is demonstraonated that the non-Markovian nature of the process is quite essential even for conventional dephasing typical of quantum dots leading to significant enhancement or inhibition of the group velocity slow-down factor as well as to the shifting and distortion of the transmission window. Furthermore, the correlation between dephasing reservoirs may also either enhance or inhibit non-Markovian effects.

abstract: We investigate spontaneous emission of a two-level atom with an arbitrarily polarized electric dipole in front of a flat dielectric surface. We treat the general case where the atomic dipole matrix element is a complex vector, that is, the atomic dipole can rotate with time in space. We calculate the rates of spontaneous emission into evanescent and radiation modes, and study the angular densities of the rates in the space of wave vectors for the field modes. We show that, when the ellipticity of the atomic dipole is not zero, the angular density of the spontaneous emission rate of the atom may have different values for the modes with the opposite in-plane wave vectors. We find that the asymmetry of the angular density of the spontaneous emission rate under the central inversion in the space of in-plane wave vectors is a result of spin-orbit coupling of light and occurs when the ellipticity vector of the atomic dipole overlaps with the ellipticity vector of the field polarization. Due to the fast decay of the field in the evanescent modes, the difference between the rates of spontaneous emission into the evanescent modes with the opposite in-plane wave vectors decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the atom to the interface. Due to the oscillatory behavior of the interference between the emitted and reflected fields, the difference between the rates of spontaneous emission into the radiation modes with the opposite in-plane wave vectors oscillates with increasing distance from the atom to the interface. This difference can be positive or negative depending on the atom-interface distance, and is zero for the zero distance.

abstract: The verification of quantum devices is an important aspect of quantum information, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental implementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the theory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a level of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified without direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is solely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of verification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In this paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct access to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing via EPR steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between full state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies EPR steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what advantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do partial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally entangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR steering allows for simpler analysis and better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the other hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to constants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main advantage in self-testing based on EPR steering could be in the case of self-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may be easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's Hilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum system.

abstract: We question the microcanonical hypothesis, often made to account for the thermalization of complex closed quantum systems, on the specific example of a chain of two-level atoms optically driven by a resonant laser beam and strongly interacting via Rydberg-Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions. Along its (necessarily unitary) evolution, this system is indeed expected to thermalize, i.e. observables, such as the number of excitations, stop oscillating and reach equilibrium-like expectation values. The latter are often calculated through assuming the system can be effectively described by a thermal-like microcanonical state. Here, we compare the distribution of excitations in the chain calculated either according to the microcanonical assumption or through direct exact numerical simulation. This allows us to show the limitations of the thermal equilibrium hypothesis and precise its applicability conditions.

abstract: The question whether a given quantum state is a ground or thermal state of a few-body Hamiltonian can be used to characterize the complexity of the state and is important for possible experimental implementations. We provide methods to characterize the states generated by two- and, more generally, k-body Hamiltonians as well as the convex hull of these sets. This leads to new insights into the question which states are uniquely determined by their marginals and to a generalization of the concept of entanglement. Finally, certification methods for quantum simulation can be derived.

abstract: We present a novel proposal for generating quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct states of a bulk mechanical oscillator, compatible with existing optomechanical devices operating in the readily achievable bad-cavity limit. The scheme is based on a pulsed cavity optomechanical quantum non-demolition (QND) interaction, driven by displaced non-Gaussian states, and measurement-induced feedback, avoiding the need for strong single-photon optomechanical coupling. Furthermore, we show that single-quadrature cooling of the mechanical oscillator is sufficient for efficient state preparation, and we outline a three-pulse protocol comprising a sequence of QND interactions for squeezing-enhanced cooling, state preparation, and tomography.

abstract: A key ingredient for quantum photonic technologies is an on-demand source of indistinguishable single photons. State-of-the-art indistinguishable-single-photon sources typically employ resonant excitation pulses with fixed repetition rates, creating a string of single photons with predetermined arrival times. However, in future applications, an independent electronic signal from a larger quantum circuit or network will trigger the generation of an indistinguishable photon. Further, operating the photon source up to the limit imposed by its lifetime is desirable. Here we report on the application of a true on-demand approach in which we can electronically trigger the precise arrival time of a single photon as well as control the excitation pulse duration. We investigate in detail the effect of finite duration of an excitation $\pi$ pulse on the degree of photon antibunching. Finally, we demonstrate that highly indistinguishable single photons can be generated using this on-demand approach, enabling maximum flexibility for future applications.

abstract: In this work we study the de Haas van Alfhen (dHvA) effect for neutral atoms with a nonvanishing magnetic moment interacting with an electric field. Considering the particles confined in a two dimensional (2D) atomic cloud and using the Landau-Aharonov-Casher (LAC) theory, we obtain the effective magnetic field as well as the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the system. Assuming the neutral atoms as being $ ^{87}\mathrm{Rb} $ ultracold Rydberg atoms we calculate the degeneracy of the energy levels. Under a strong effective magnetic field regime we present the quantum oscillations in the energy and effective magnetization of the atomic gas. From the dHvA period we determine the area of the Fermi circle of the atomic cloud.

abstract: In atomic clocks, the frequency of a local oscillator is stabilized based on the feedback signal obtained by periodically interrogating an atomic reference system. The instability of the clock is characterized by the Allan variance, a measure widely used to describe the noise of frequency standards. We provide an explicit method to find the ultimate bound on the Allan variance of an atomic clock in the most general scenario where N atoms are prepared in an arbitrarily entangled state and arbitrary measurement and feedback schemes are allowed, including those that exploit coherences between succeeding interrogation steps. While the method is rigorous and completely general, it becomes numerically inefficient for large N and long averaging times. This could be remedied by incorporating numerical methods based on e.g. a matrix product states approximation.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.01703
abstract: We derive a new inequality that is necessary and sufficient to show EPR-steering in a scenario employing only correlations between two arbitrary dichotomic measurements on each party. Thus the inequality is a complete steering analogy of the CHSH inequality, a generalisation of the result of Cavalcanti et al, JOSA B, 32(4), A74 (2015). We show that violation of the inequality only requires measuring over equivalence classes of mutually unbiased measurements on the trusted party and in fact assuming a general two qubit system arbitrary pairs of distinct projective measurements at the trusted party are equally useful. Via this it is found that for a given state the maximum violation of our EPR-steering inequality is equal to that for the CHSH inequality, so all states that are EPR-steerable with CHSH-type correlations are also Bell nonlocal.

abstract: Entropic dynamics is a framework in which quantum theory is derived as an application of entropic methods of inference. Entropic dynamics on flat spaces has been extensively studied. The objective of this paper is to extend the entropic dynamics of $N$ particles to curved spaces. The important new feature is that the displacement of a particle does not transform like a vector because fluctuations can be large enough to feel the effects of curvature. The final result is a modified Schr\"odinger equation in which the usual Laplacian is replaced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

abstract: We investigate Quantum Adiabatic Optimization of n qubit systems where the ground state must tunnel through a potential barrier during the annealing process and where the configurations are weighted by a symmetric cost function that has a potential barrier of width n^a and height n^b. The optimization algorithm must tunnel through this barrier, and the time sufficient to ensure tunneling grows quadratically with the inverse spectral gap during this tunneling process. We analyze barrier sizes with a + b > 1/2 and 2a + b < 1 and show that for these barriers the minimum gap scales polynomially as n^(1/2-a-b). Our proof of this scaling uses elementary techniques and confirms a portion of an unpublished folklore result by Goldstone, which used large spin and instanton methods.

abstract: Quantum information technologies harness the intrinsic nature of quantum theory to beat the limitations of the classical methods for information processing and communication. Recently, the application of quantum features to metrology has attracted much attention. Quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT), which utilizes two-photon interference between entangled photon pairs, is a promising approach to overcome the problem with optical coherence tomography (OCT): As the resolution of OCT becomes higher, degradation of the resolution due to dispersion within the medium becomes more critical. Here we report on the realization of 0.54 $\mu$m resolution two-photon interference, which surpasses the current record resolution 0.75 $\mu$m of low-coherence interference for OCT. In addition, the resolution for QOCT showed almost no change against the dispersion of a 1 mm thickness of water inserted in the optical path, whereas the resolution for OCT dramatically degrades. For this experiment, a highly-efficient chirped quasi-phase-matched lithium tantalate device was developed using a novel $`$nano-electrode-poling$'$ technique. The results presented here represent a breakthrough for the realization of quantum protocols, including QOCT, quantum clock synchronization, and more. Our work will open up possibilities for medical and biological applications.

abstract: We consider constraint satisfaction problems of bounded degree, with a good notion of "typicality", e.g. the negation of the variables in each constraint is taken independently at random. Using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), we show that $ \mu+\Omega(1/\sqrt{D}) $ fraction of the constraints can be satisfied for typical instances, with the assignment efficiently produced by QAOA. We do so by showing that the averaged fraction of constraints being satisfied is $ \mu+\Omega(1/\sqrt{D}) $, with small variance. Here $ \mu $ is the fraction that would be satisfied by a uniformly random assignment, and $ D $ is the number of constraints that each variable can appear. CSPs with typicality include Max-$ k $XOR and Max-$ k $SAT. We point out how it can be applied to determine the typical ground-state energy of some local Hamiltonians. We also give a similar result for instances with "no overlapping constraints", using the quantum algorithm. We sketch how the classical algorithm might achieve some partial result.

abstract: We extend the non-Hermitian one-dimension quantum walk model [PRL 102, 065703 (2009)] by taking the dephasing effect into account. We prove that the feature of topological transition does not change even the dephasing between the sites within units is present. The potential experimental observation of our theoretical results in the circuit QED system consisting of superconducting qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator mode is discussed and numerically simulated. The results clearly show a topological transition in quantum walk, and display the robustness of such a system to the decay and dephasing of qubits. We also discuss how to extend model to higher dimension in the circuit QED system.

Mainly concentrating on the quantum Fisher information with respect to the mechanical frequency, we find that the corresponding precision of parameter estimation on the mechanical frequency can be enhanced by applying applicable optical resonant pulsed driving on the cavity of the optome- chanical system. Further investigation shows that the mechanical squeezing resulting from the optical pulsed driving is the quantum resource used in optimal quantum estimation on the frequency.

abstract: We study coherent phonon oscillations and tunneling between two coupled nonlinear nanomechanical resonators. We show that the coupling between two nanomechanical resonators creates an effective phonon Josephson junction which exhibits two different dynamical behaviors: Josephson oscillation (phonon-Rabi oscillation) and macroscopic self-trapping (phonon blockade). Self-trapping originates from mechanical nonlinearities, meaning that when the nonlinearity exceeds its critical value, the energy exchange between the two resonators is suppressed, and phonon-Josephson oscillations between them are completely blocked. An effective classical Hamiltonian for the phonon Josephson junction is derived and its mean-field dynamics is studied in phase space. Finally, we study the phonon-phonon coherence quantified by the mean fringe visibility, and show that the interaction between the two resonators may lead to the loss of coherence in the phononic junction.

abstract: In this paper we give a pedagogical introduction to non-equilibrium thermodynamics of small quantum systems, using only basic concepts from undergraduate quantum and statistical mechanics. After reviewing the concept of work, as usually taught in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, we discuss the framework of non-equilibrium processes in quantum systems together with some modern developments, such as the Jarzynski equality and its connection to the second law of thermodynamics. We then apply these results to the problem of magnetic resonance, where all calculations may be done exactly. It is shown in detail how to build the statistics of the work, both for a single particle and for a collection of non-interacting particles. We hope that this paper may serve as a tool to bring the new student up to date on the recent developments in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

abstract: Multi-photon system has been studied by many groups. The challenge facing by most groups is the limited samples are far from enough for detecting quantum entanglement. The problem is even more serious for the quantum state tomography. Adaptive quantum state tomography is one possible way to solve the problem. We develop a distribution scheme of samples and extend it into three step to improve the performance of adaptive quantum state tomography. Mean Square Error of reconstructed density matrix is improved for several states being tested numerically. In addition, Phaselift is applied to save the storage space of measurement operator.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.01880
abstract: We apply the formalism of quantum measurement theory to the idealized measurement of the position of a particle with an optical interferometer, finding that the backaction of counting entangled photons systematically collapses the particle's wavefunction toward a narrow Gaussian wavepacket at the location $x_\mathrm{est}$ determined by the measurement without appeal to environmental decoherence or other spontaneous collapse mechanism. Further, the variance in the particle's position, as calculated from the post-measurement wavefunction agrees precisely with shot-noise limited uncertainty of the measured $x_\mathrm{est}$. Both the identification of the absolute square of the particle's initial wavefunction as the probability density for $x_\mathrm{est}$ and the de Broglie hypothesis emerge as consequences of interpreting the intensity of the optical field as proportional to the probability of detecting a photon. Linear momentum information that is encoded in the particle's initial wavefunction survives the measurement, and the pre-measurement expectation values are preserved in the ensemble average.

abstract: The general framework of entropic dynamics is used to formulate a relational quantum dynamics. The main new idea is to use tools of information geometry to develop an entropic measure of the mismatch between successive configurations of a system. This leads to an entropic version of the classical best matching technique developed by J. Barbour and collaborators. The procedure is illustrated in the simple case of a system of N particles with global translational symmetry. The generalization to other symmetries whether global (rotational invariance) or local (gauge invariance) is straightforward. The entropic best matching allows a quantum implementation Mach's principles of spatial and temporal relationalism and provides the foundation for a method of handling gauge theories in an informational framework.

abstract: We study the full time evolution of a system of two modes of a bosonic quantum field that interact through quadratic hamiltonians. We specialise to a time dependent two-mode squeezing Hamiltonian where the coupling is switched on and off smoothly. We find the analytical solutions to the time evolution after the interaction is turned off, which apply to arbitrary coupling functions. We investigate the final state of the system and compute all physically relevant quantities, such as average particle number, entanglement and change in energy. Our techniques can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, which include implementations of time dependent two-mode squeezing, coupled harmonic oscillators, harmonic oscillators coupled to light. Furthermore, these techniques can be extended to more complicated time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonians. We briefly discuss possible applications within the area of relativistic and quantum information.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.01936
abstract: We present a scheme to estimate Gaussian states of one-dimensional continuous variable systems, based on weak (unsharp) quantum measurements. The estimation of a Gaussian state requires us to find position ($q$), momentum ($p$) and their second order moments. We measure $q$ weakly and follow it up with a projective measurement of $p$ on half of the ensemble, and on the other half we measure $p$ weakly followed by a projective measurement of $q$. In each case we use the state twice before discarding it. We compare our results with projective measurements and demonstrate that under certain conditions such weak measurement-based estimation schemes, where recycling of the states is possible, can outperform projective measurement-based state estimation schemes.

abstract: The research presented in this article concerns the stroboscopic approach to quantum tomography, which is an area of science where quantum Physics and linear algebra overlap. In this article we introduce the algebraic structure of the parametric-dependent quantum channels for 2-level and 3-level systems such that the generator of evolution corresponding with the Kraus operators has no degenerate eigenvalues. In such cases the index of cyclicity of the generator is equal $1$, which physically means that there exists one observable the measurement of which performed sufficient number of times at distinct instants provides enough data to reconstruct the initial density matrix and, consequently, the trajectory of the state. Necessary conditions for the parameters and relations between them are introduced. The results presented in this paper seem to have considerable potential applications in experiments due to the fact that one can perform quantum tomography by conducting only one kind of measurement. Therefore, the analyzed evolution models can be considered optimal in the context of quantum tomography. Finally, we also introduce some remarks concerning optimal evolution models in case of $n-$dimensional Hilbert space.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.02029
abstract: We present two complete maximally hyperentangled state analysis protocols for photons entangled in the polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom. The first protocol is a hyperentangled Bell state analysis scheme for two photons and the second is a hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne- Zeilinger (GHZ) state analysis scheme for three photons. In each scheme, a set of mutually orthogonal hyperentangled basis states are completely and deterministically discriminated with the aid of cross-Kerr nonlinearities and linear optics. We also generalize the schemes to unambiguously analyze the N-photon hyperentangled GHZ state. Compared with previous protocols, our schemes greatly simplify the discrimination process and reduce the requirements on nonlinearities by using the measured spatial-mode state to assist in the analysis of the polarization state. These advantages make our schemes useful for practical applications in long-distance high capacity quantum communication.

abstract: We present a complete hyperentangled Bell state analysis protocol for two-photon four-qubit states which are simultaneously entangled in the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. The 16 hyperentangled states can be unambiguously distinguished via two steps. In the first step, the polarization entangled state is distinguished deterministically and nondestructively with the help of the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Then, in the second step, the time-bin state is analyzed with the aid of the polarization entanglement. We also discuss the applications of our protocol for quantum information processing. Compared with hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom, the polarization and time-bin hyperentangled states provide saving in quantum resources since there is no requirement for two spatial modes for each photon. This is the first complete hyperentangled Bell state analysis scheme for polarization and time-bin hyperentangled states, and it can provide new avenues for high-capacity, long-distance quantum communication.

abstract: Inspired by the success of Boltzmann Machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution, we propose a new machine learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution of a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Due to the non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics, the training process of the Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) can become nontrivial. We circumvent the problem by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities. This allows us to train the QBM efficiently by sampling. We show examples of QBM training with and without the bound, using exact diagonalization, and compare the results with classical Boltzmann training. We also discuss the possibility of using quantum annealing processors like D-Wave for QBM training and application.

abstract: It is shown that a periodic emergence and destruction of an additional quantum number leads to an exponential growth of energy of a quantum mechanical system subjected to a slow periodic variation of parameters. The main example is given by systems (e.g., quantum billiards and quantum graphs) with periodically divided configuration space. In special cases, the process can also lead to a long period of cooling that precedes the acceleration, and to the desertion of the states with a particular value of the quantum number.

abstract: We investigate time evolution of coherent and squeezed states for two quantum systems. First we consider a system with a Hamiltonian quadratic in $q$ and $p$ variables. We show that only in special cases the coherence and squeezing is preserved during time development and in general only for specific values of the evolution parameter $t$ a state is coherent or squeezed. As the second system we consider one of the simplest systems with purely quantum time evolution. We calculate the explicit formulas for the time dependent uncertainties of position and momentum in an initial coherent state and show that in this case the coherence is also not preserved during time development.

abstract: It is well known that in the presence of a ring cavity the light scattering from a uniform atomic ensemble can become unstable resulting in the collective atomic recoil lasing. This is the result of a positive feedback due to the cavity. We propose to add an additional electronic feedback loop based on the photodetection of the scattered light. The advantage is a great flexibility in choosing the feedback algorithm, since manipulations with electric signals are very well developed. In this paper we address the application of such a feedback to atoms in the Bose-Einstein condensed state and explore the quantum noise due to the incoherent feedback action. We show that although the feedback based on the photodetection does not change the local stability of the initial uniform distribution with respect to small disturbances, it reduces the region of attraction of the uniform equilibrium. The feedback-induced nonlinearity enables quantum fluctuations to bring the system out of the stability region and cause an exponential growth even if the uniform state is globally stable without the feedback. Using numerical solution of the feedback master equation we show that there is no feedback-induced noise in the quadratures of the excited atomic and light modes. The feedback loop, however, introduces additional noise into the number of quanta of these modes. Importantly, the feedback opens an opportunity to position the modulated BEC inside a cavity as well as tune the phase of scattered light. This can find applications in precision measurements and quantum simulations.

abstract: Integrated optics allows one to perform interferometric experiments based upon multi-port beam-splitter. To observe entanglement effects one can use multi-mode parametric down-conversion emissions. When the structure of the Hamiltonian governing the emissions has (infinitely) many equivalent Schmidt decompositions into modes (beams), one can have perfect EPR-like correlations of numbers of photons emitted into "conjugate modes" which can be monitored at spatially separated detection stations. We provide series of entanglement conditions for all prime numbers of modes, and show their violations by bright multi-mode squeezed vacuum states. One family of such conditions is given in terms of the usual intensity-related variables. Moreover, we show that an alternative series of conditions expressed in terms averages of observed rates, which is a generalization of the ones given in arXiv:1508.02368, is a much better entanglement indicator. Thus the rates seem to emerge as a powerful concept in quantum optics. Generalizations of the approach are expected.

abstract: Decoherence-free state (DFS) encoding supplies a useful way to avoid the environmental detrimental influence on quantum information processing. The DFS was previously well established in either the two subsystems locating at the same spatial position or the dynamics under the Born-Markovian approximation. We here investigate the exact DFS of two spatially separated quantum systems consisting of two-level systems or harmonic oscillators coupled to a common non-Markovian zero-temperature bosonic environment. The exact distance-dependent DFS and the explicit criterion for forming the DFS are obtained analytically, which reveal that the DFS can arise only in one-dimensional environment. It is remarkable to further find that the DFS is just the system reduced state of the famous bound state in the continuum (BIC) of the total system predicted by Wigner and von Neumann. On the one hand our result gives the insight to the physical nature of the DFS, and on the other it supplies an experimentally accessible scheme to realize the mathematically curious BIC in the standard quantum optical systems.

abstract: One-way quantum deficit and quantum discord are two important measures of quantum correlations. We revisit the relationship between them in two-qubit systems. We investigate the conditions that both one-way quantum deficit and quantum discord have the same optimal measurement ensembles, and demonstrate that one-way quantum deficit can be derived from the quantum discord for a class of X states. Moreover, we give an explicit relation between one-way quantum deficit and entanglement of formation. We show that under phase damping channel both one-way quantum deficit and quantum discord evolve exactly in the same way for four parameters X states. Some examples are presented in details.

abstract: Interferometers operating at or close to quantum limits of precision have found wide application in tabletop searches for physics beyond the standard model, the study of fundamental forces and symmetries of nature and foundational tests of quantum mechanics. The limits imposed by quantum fluctuations and measurement backaction on conventional interferometers ($\delta \phi \sim 1/\sqrt{N}$) have spurred the development of schemes to circumvent these limits through quantum interference, multiparticle interactions and entanglement. A prominent example of such schemes, the so-called $SU(1,1)$ interferometer, has been shown to be particularly robust against particle loss and inefficient detection, and has been demonstrated with photons and ultracold atoms. Here, we realize a $SU(1,1)$ interferometer in a fundamentally new platform in which the interfering arms are distinct flexural modes of a millimeter-scale mechanical resonator. We realize up to 15.4(3) dB of noise squeezing and demonstrate the Heisenberg scaling of interferometric sensitivity ($\delta \phi \sim 1/N$), corresponding to a 6-fold improvement in measurement precision over a conventional interferometer. Our work extends the optomechanical toolbox for the quantum manipulation of macroscopic mechanical motion and presents new avenues for studies of optomechanical sensing and the nonequilibrium dynamics of multimode optomechanical systems.

abstract: Interesting connection has been established between two apparently unrelated concepts, namely, quantum nonlocality and Bayesian game theory. It has been shown that nonlocal correlations in the form of advice can outperform the best classical strategies in common interest Bayesian games and can also surpass the fair classical equilibrium payoffs in conflicting games. However a conflicting game may have unfair equilibrium strategies, which are the archetypal of such games and never occur in common interest games. In this work, making the connection between nonlocality and Bayesian game more striking, we show that quantum strategies can outperform even the unfair classical equilibrium strategies in conflicting games. For this purpose here we consider the conflicting game proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 020401 (2015)]. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of the nonlocal correlations that are advantageous over the best fair and unfair classical strategies in the said game.

abstract: The propagation and divergence properties of beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) plays a crucial role in many applications. Here we present a general study on the divergence of optical beams with OAM. We show that the mean absolute value of the OAM imposes a lower bound on the value of the beam divergence. We discuss our results for two different definitions of divergence, the so called rms or encircled-energy. The bound on the rms divergence can be expressed as a generalized uncertainty principle, with applications in long-range communication, microscopy and 2D quantum systems.

abstract: We have calculated the intensity of electromagnetic radiation from particles rotating in close vicinity to a transparent dielectric plate. The radiation is a result of quantum and thermal friction occurring during the particle rotation, while the driving factor of radiation is a decrease in the kinetic energy of particle. The characteristic frequency of radiation is determined by the angular velocity and the temperature of the plate and surrounding vacuum background. These results are challenging for experimental verification in future.

abstract: Granting information privacy is of crucial importance in our society, notably in fiber communication networks. Quantum cryptography provides a unique means to establish, at remote locations, identical strings of genuine random bits, with a level of secrecy unattainable using classical resources. However, several constraints, such as non-optimized photon number statistics and resources, detectors' noise, and optical losses, currently limit the performances in terms of both achievable secret key rates and distances. Here, these issues are addressed using an approach that combines both fundamental and off-the-shelves technological resources. High-quality bipartite photonic entanglement is distributed over a 150 km fiber link, exploiting a wavelength demultiplexing strategy implemented at the end-user locations. It is shown how coincidence rates scale linearly with the number of employed telecommunication channels, with values outperforming previous realizations by almost one order of magnitude. Thanks to its potential of scalability and compliance with device-independent strategies, this system is ready for real quantum applications, notably entanglement-based quantum cryptography.

abstract: Arrays of trapped ultracold molecules represent a promising platform for implementing a universal quantum computer. DeMille has detailed a prototype design based on Stark states of polar $^1\Sigma$ molecules as qubits. Herein, we consider an array of polar $^2\Sigma$ molecules which are, in addition, inherently paramagnetic and whose Hund's case (b) free-rotor states are Bell states. We show that by subjecting the array to combinations of concurrent homogeneous and inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields, the entanglement of the array's Stark and Zeeman states can be tuned and the qubit sites addressed. Two schemes for implementing an optically controlled CNOT gate are proposed and their feasibility discussed in the face of the broadening of spectral lines due to dipole-dipole coupling and the inhomogeneity of the electric and magnetic fields.

abstract: Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum gate in decoherence-free subspaces is of greatly practical importance due to its built-in fault tolerance, coherence stabilization virtues, and short run-time. Here we propose some compact schemes to implement two- and three-qubit controlled unitary quantum gates and Fredkin gate. For the controlled unitary quantum gates, the unitary operator acting on the target qubit is an arbitrary single-qubit gate operation. The controlled quantum gates can be directly implemented using non-adiabatic holonomy in decoherence-free subspaces and the required resource for the decoherence-free subspace encoding is minimal by using only two neighboring physical qubits undergoing collective dephasing to encode a logical qubit.

We demonstrate a proof-of-principle implementation of this measurement-only blind quantum computing, exploiting a photonic setup to generate four-qubit cluster states for computation and verification. Feasible technological requirements for the client and the device-independent blindness make this scheme very applicable for future secure quantum networks.

Our proposed definition of quantum probability makes it possible to describe quantum measurements and quantum decision making on the same common mathematical footing. Conditions are formulated for the case when quantum decision theory reduces to its classical counterpart and for the situation where the use of quantum decision theory is necessary.

abstract: Teleporation with partially entangled quantum channel cannot achieve unit fidelity and unit probability. We show that the conditions for faithful teleportation of a pure state or a mixed state can be described by the same general relation $\rho_{q}\rho_{m} = pI$, where $\rho_{q}$ is the reduced density matrix of the quantum channel, $\rho_{m}$ is the reduced density matrix of the measurement basis, and $p$ is the probability of faithful teleportaion. These conditions are unchanged under unitary transformation. We also prove that using a four dimensional partially entangled quantum channel, it is not possible to find a set of orthogonal measurement basis that contains more than two faithfully teleporting measurements.

abstract: The problem of constructing physically and mathematically well-defined Wigner functions for the canonical pair angle and angular momentum is solved. While a key element for the construction of Wigner functions for the planar phase space is the Heisenberg-Weyl group, the corresponding group for the cylindrical phase space is the Euclidean group of the plane and its unitary representations. Here the angle is replaced by the pair (cos,sin) which determines the points on the unit circle uniquely. The main properties of the Wigner functions for the planar and the cylindrical spaces are strikingly similar. A crucial role is played by the sinc-function.

abstract: The theory of relativity requires that no information travel faster than light, whereas the unitarity of quantum mechanics ensures that quantum information cannot be cloned. These conditions provide the basic constraints that appear in information replication tasks, which formalize aspects of the behavior of information in relativistic quantum mechanics. In this article, we provide continuous variable (CV) strategies for spacetime quantum information replication that are directly amenable to optical or mechanical implementation. We use a new class of homologically-constructed CV quantum error correcting codes to provide efficient solutions for the general case of information replication. As compared to schemes encoding qubits, our CV solution requires half as many shares per encoded system. We also provide an optimized five-mode strategy for replicating quantum information in a particular configuration of four spacetime regions designed not to be reducible to previously performed experiments. For this optimized strategy, we provide detailed encoding and decoding procedures using standard optical apparatus and calculate the recovery fidelity when finite squeezing is used. As such we provide a scheme for experimentally realizing quantum information replication using quantum optics.

abstract: In this article we derive the closed form expressions for the characteristic (geometric / dynamical and global) phases of the pure spinor. The characteristic phases are presented as a function of the elements of the time dependent Hamiltonian and the Bloch vector. We show unequivocally that spinors, generated by the SU(2) group, and vectors, generated by the SO(3) group, are identical objects, as the vector possesses the same characteristic phases as the spinor, albeit hidden. This article is supplemented with a from first principles derivation of all results presented herein.

abstract: The mechanism of the transition of a dynamical system from quantum to classical mechanics is of continuing interest. Practically it is of importance for the interpretation of multi-particle coincidence measurements performed at macroscopic distances from a microscopic reaction zone. Here we prove the generalized iimaging theorem which shows that the spatial wave function of any multi-particle quantum system, propagating over distances and times large on an atomic scale but still microscopic, and subject to deterministic external fields and particle interactions, becomes proportional to the initial momentum wave function where the position and momentum coordinates define a classical trajectory. Currently, the quantum to classical transition is considered to occur via decoherence caused by stochastic interaction with an environment. The imaging theorem arises from unitary Schroedinger propagation and so is valid without any environmental interaction. It implies that a simultaneous measurement of both position and momentum will define a unique classical trajectory, whereas a less complete measurement of say position alone can lead to quantum interference effects.

abstract: Wavefunction collapse is usually seen as a discontinuous violation of the unitary evolution of a quantum system, caused by the observation. Moreover, the collapse appears to be nonlocal in a sense which seems at odds with General Relativity. In this article the possibility that the wavefunction evolves continuously and hopefully unitarily during the measurement process is analyzed. It is argued that such a solution has to be formulated using a time symmetric replacement of the initial value problem in Quantum Mechanics. Major difficulties in apparent conflict with unitary evolution are identified, but eventually its possibility is not completely ruled out. This interpretation is in a weakened sense both local and realistic, without contradicting Bell's theorem. Moreover, if it is true, it makes Quantum Mechanics consistent with General Relativity in the semiclassical framework.

abstract: A boson sampling device could efficiently sample from the output probability distribution of noninteracting bosons undergoing many-body interference. This problem is not only classically intractable, but its solution is also believed to be classically unverifiable. Hence, a major difficulty in experiment is to ensure a boson sampling device performs correctly. We present an experimental friendly scheme to extract useful and robust information from the quantum boson samplers based on coarse-grained measurements. The procedure can be applied to certify the equivalence of boson sampling devices while ruling out alternative fraudulent devices. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and consider the effects of realistic noise. Our approach is expected to be generally applicable to other many-body certification tasks beyond the boson sampling problem.

Large area and high-stress SiN$_x$ membranes were fabricated and used as optomechanical resonators in a Michelson interferometer and in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity. The measurements show that the fabrication process preserves both the optical quality and the mechanical quality factor of the membrane.

abstract: We study spectral parametric correlations in quantum chaotic systems and introduce the number covariance as a measure of such correlations. We derive analytic results for the classical random matrix ensembles using the binary correlation method and obtain compact expressions for the co- variance. We illustrate the universality of this measure by presenting the spectral analysis of the quantum kicked rotors for the time-reversal invariant and time-reversal non-invariant cases. A local version of the parametric number variance introduced earlier is also investigated.

abstract: Quantum enhanced sensing is a powerful technique in which nonclassical states are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical displacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should produce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical system, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne efficiency of 94%. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical light enhances the measurement of the motion.

abstract: Individual addressing of qubits is essential for scalable quantum computation. Spatial addressing allows unlimited numbers of qubits to share the same frequency, whilst enabling arbitrary parallel operations. We demonstrate addressing of long-lived $^{43}\text{Ca}^+$ "atomic clock" qubits held in separate zones of a microfabricated surface trap with integrated microwave electrodes. By coherently cancelling the microwave field in one zone we measure a ratio of Rabi frequencies between addressed and non-addressed qubits of up to 1400, implying an addressing error of $1.3\times 10^{-6}$. Off-resonant excitation prevents this error level being directly demonstrated, but we also show polarization control of the microwave field with error $2\times 10^{-5}$, sufficient to suppress off-resonant excitation out of the qubit states to the $\sim 10^{-9}$ level. Such polarization control could enable fast microwave operations.

abstract: Quantum coherence as the fundamental characteristic of quantum physics, provides the valuable resource for quantum computation in exceeding the power of classical algorithms. The exploration of quantum coherence in relativistic systems is of significance from both the fundamental points of view and practical applications. We investigate the quantum coherence of two free modes of scalar and Dirac fields as detected by two relatively accelerated observers by resorting to the relative entropy of coherence. We show that the relative entropy of coherence monotonically decreases when acceleration goes up, as a consequence of the Unruh effect. Specifically, the initial states with parameters $\alpha=b$ and $\alpha=\sqrt{1-b^2}$ have the same initial relative entropy coherence at $a=0$ (with $a$ the acceleration), but degrade along two different trajectories. The relative entropy of coherence reaches vanishing value in the scalar field in the infinite acceleration limit, but non-vanishing value in the Dirac field. This suggests that in the Dirac field, the bipartite state possesses quantum coherence to some extent with the variation of the relative acceleration, and may lead to potential applications in quantum computation performed by observers in motion relatively.

abstract: Quantum correlations including entanglement and quantum discord has drawn much attention in characterizing quantum phase transitions. Quantum deficit originates in questions regarding work extraction from quantum systems coupled to a heat bath [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 180402 (2002)]. It links quantum thermodynamics with quantum correlations and provides a new standpoint for understanding quantum non-locality. In this paper, we evaluate the one-way deficit of two adjacent spins in the bulk for the XX model. In the thermodynamic limit, the XX model undergoes a first order transition from fully polarized to a critical phase with quasi-long-range order with decrease of quantum parameter. We find that the one-way deficit becomes nonzero after the critical point. Therefore, the one-way deficit characterizes the quantum phase transition in the XX model.

abstract: We present a general formula for the spectroscopically-accessible level shifts and decay rates of an atom moving at an arbitrary angle relative to a surface. Our Markov formulation leads to an intuitive analytic description whereby the shifts and rates are obtained from the coefficients of the Heisenberg equation of motion for the atomic flip operators but with complex Doppler-shifted (velocity dependent) transition frequencies. Our results conclusively demonstrate that for the limiting case of parallel motion the shifts and rates are quadratic or higher in the atomic velocity, and sheds light on continuing disagreements about the basic nature of quantum friction. We show that a stronger, linear velocity-dependence is exhibited by the rates and shifts for perpendicular motion, thus opening the prospect of experimentally studying the elusive phenomenon of quantum friction.

Scattering by a real cubic potential is investigated as a specific case.

abstract: Photon subtraction can enhance the performance of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD). However, the enhancement effect will be reduced by the imperfections of practical devices, especially the limited efficiency of a single-photon detector. In this paper, we propose a non-Gaussian postselection method to emulate the photon substraction used in coherent-state CV QKD protocols. The virtual photon subtraction not only can avoid the complexity and imperfections of a practical photon-subtraction operation, which extends the secure transmission distance as the ideal case does, but also can be adjusted flexibly according to the channel parameters to optimize the performance. Furthermore, our preliminary tests on the information reconciliation suggest that in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime, the performance of reconciliating the postselected non-Gaussian data is better than that of the Gaussian data, which implies the feasibility of implementing this method practically.

abstract: We theoretically report an analog of photon-assisted tunneling (PAT) in a periodically driven lattice array without a static biased potential by studying a three-channel waveguide system. This analog of PAT can be achieved by only periodically modulating the top waveguide and adjusting the distance between the bottom and its adjacent waveguide. It is numerically shown that the PAT resonances also exist in the five-channel waveguide system and probably exist in the waveguide arrays with other odd numbers of waveguides, but they will become weak as the number of waveguides increases. With origin different from traditional PAT, this type of PAT found in our work is closely linked to the existence of the zero-energy (dark) Floquet states. It is readily observable under currently accessible experimental conditions and may be useful for controlling light propagation in waveguide arrays.

abstract: Since their conception, Schr\"odinger's cats have captured the collective imagination. Photonic cat states are superpositions of two coherent states with opposite phases and with a significant number of photons. Recently, these states have been observed in the transient dynamics of a driven-dissipative resonator subject to engineered two-photon processes. Here we present an exact analytical solution of the steady-state density matrix for this class of systems by including one-photon losses, that are considered detrimental for the achievement of cat states. We demonstrate that the unique steady state is a statistical mixture of two cat-like states with opposite parity, in spite of significant one-photon losses. The transient dynamics to the steady-state depends dramatically on the initial state and can pass through a metastable regime lasting orders of magnitudes longer than the photon lifetime. By considering individual quantum trajectories in photon counting configuration, we find that the system intermittently jumps between two cats. We propose a feedback protocol based on this behaviour generating a pure cat-like steady-state.

abstract: It was recently pointed out that identifiability of quantum random walks and hidden Markov processes underlie the same principles. This analogy immediately raises questions on the existence of hidden states also in quantum random walks and their relationship with earlier debates on hidden states in quantum mechanics. The overarching insight was that not only hidden Markov processes, but also quantum random walks are finitary processes. Since finitary processes enjoy nice asymptotic properties, this also encourages to further investigate the asymptotic properties of quantum random walks. Here, answers to all these questions are given. Quantum random walks, hidden Markov processes and finitary processes are put into a unifying model context. In this context, quantum random walks are seen to not only enjoy nice ergodic properties in general, but also intuitive quantum-style asymptotic properties. It is also pointed out how hidden states arising from our framework relate to hidden states in earlier, prominent treatments on topics such as the EPR paradoxon or Bell's inequalities.

abstract: Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces protects quantum information from control imprecisions and decoherence. For the non-collective decoherence that each qubit has its own bath, we show the implementations of two non-commutable holonomic single-qubit gates and one holonomic nontrivial two-qubit gate that compose a universal set of non-adiabatic holonomic quantum gates in decoherence-free-subspaces of the decoupling group, with an encoding rate of $\frac{N-2}{N}$. The proposed scheme is robust against control imprecisions and the non-collective decoherence, and its non-adiabatic property ensures less operation time. We demonstrate that our proposed scheme can be realized by utilizing only two-qubit interactions rather than many-qubit interactions. Our results reduce the complexity of practical implementation of holonomic quantum computation in experiments. We also discuss the physical implementation of our scheme in coupled microcavities.

abstract: The need for Hamiltonians with many-body interactions arises in various applications of quantum computing. However, interactions beyond two-body are difficult to realize experimentally. Perturbative gadgets were introduced to obtain arbitrary many-body effective interactions using Hamiltonians with two-body interactions only. Although valid for arbitrary $k$-body interactions, their use is limited to small $k$ because the strength of interaction is $k$'th order in perturbation theory. In this paper we develop a nonperturbative technique for obtaining effective $k$-body interactions using Hamiltonians consisting of at most $l$-body interactions with $l<k$. This technique works best for Hamiltonians with a few interactions with very large $k$ and can be used together with perturbative gadgets to embed Hamiltonians of considerable complexity in proper subspaces of two-local Hamiltonians. We describe how our technique can be implemented in a hybrid (gate-based and adiabatic) as well as solely adiabatic quantum computing scheme.

abstract: We present a simple derivation of the interference pattern in matter-wave interferometry as predicted by a class of master equations, by using the density matrix formalism. We apply the obtained formulae to the most relevant collapse models, namely the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) model, the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model together with its dissipative (dCSL) and non-markovian generalizations (cCSL) and the Di\'{o}si-Penrose (DP) model. We discuss the separability of the collapse models dynamics along the 3 spatial directions, the validity of the paraxial approximation and the amplification mechanism. We obtain analytical expressions both in the far field and near field limits. These results agree with those already derived in the Wigner function formalism. We compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental data from two relevant matter-wave experiments: the 2012 far-field experiment and the 2013 Kapitza Dirac Talbot Lau (KDTL) near-field experiment of Arndt's group. We show the region of the parameter space for each collapse model, which is excluded by these experiments. We show that matter-wave experiments provide model insensitive bounds, valid for a wide family of dissipative and non-markovian generalizations.

abstract: The quantum internet holds promise for performing quantum communication, such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution (QKD), freely between any parties all over the globe. Such a future quantum network, depending on the communication distance of the requesting parties, necessitates to invoke several classes of optical quantum communication such as point-to-point communication protocols, intercity QKD protocols and quantum repeater protocols. Recently, Takeoka, Guha and Wilde (TGW) have presented a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff on quantum communication capacity and secret key agreement capacity of any lossy channel assisted by unlimited forward and backward classical communication [Nat. Commun. 5, 5235 (2014)]. However, this bound is applicable only to the simplest class of quantum communication, i.e., the point-to-point communication protocols, and it has thus remained open to grasp the potential of a `worldwide' quantum network. Here we generalize the TGW bound to be applicable to any type of two-party quantum communication over the quantum internet, including other indispensable but much more intricate classes of quantum communication, intercity QKD protocols and quantum repeater protocols. We also show that there is essentially no scaling gap between our bound and the quantum communication efficiencies of known protocols. Therefore, our result, corresponding to a fundamental and practical limitation for the quantum internet, will contribute to design an efficient quantum internet in the future.

abstract: We propose and demonstrate experimentally a scheme to create entangled history states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type. In our experiment, the polarization states of a single photon at three different times are prepared as a GHZ entangled history state. We define a GHZ functional which attains a maximum value $1$ on the ideal GHZ entangled history state and is bounded above by $1/16$ for any three-time history state lacking tripartite entanglement. We have measured the GHZ functional on a state we have prepared experimentally, yielding a value of $0.656\pm 0.005$, clearly demonstrating the contribution of entangled histories.

abstract: In this work, we explore a new direction by complementing the game-theoretic applications of nonlocal correlations through appropriately formulated games using temporal quantum correlations. In the context of Bayesian games, we show the way temporal correlations can be utilized, thereby leading to quantum strategies that are impossible to simulate in a classical world. Furthermore, by educing some intriguing characteristics of projective measurements performed between two temporally separated measurements on a given system, we also construct some specific types of Biased Bayesian games. Finally, we impart a new dimension to the cooperative Bayesian Nonlocal Game introduced in [Nat. Comm. 4, 2057 (2013)] through expedient inclusion of temporal correlations in the EPR-Bohm setting.

abstract: The linear time-dependent constants of motion of the parametric amplifier are obtained and used to determine in the tomographic-probability representation the evolution of a general two-mode Gaussian state. By means of the discretization of the continuous variable density matrix, the von Neumann and linear entropies are calculated to measure the entanglement properties between the modes of the amplifier. The obtained results for the nonlocal correlations are compared with those associated to a linear map of discretized symplectic Gaussian-state tomogram onto a qubit tomogram. This qubit portrait procedure is used to establish Bell-type's inequalities, which provide a necessary condition to determine the separability of quantum states, which can be evaluated through homodyne detection. Other no-signaling nonlocal correlations are defined through the portrait procedure for noncomposite systems.

abstract: Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) is a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm that samples the equilibrium thermal state of a Quantum Annealing (QA) Hamiltonian. In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been proposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases it remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA. One piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing comes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric cost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an exponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal fluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing which passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time, arguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a comparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA efficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of this spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the growing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of tunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over classical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze only a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques applied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the quantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary distribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of SQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient.

abstract: We address the role of the phase-insensitive trusted preparation and detection noise in the security of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution, considering the Gaussian protocols on the basis of coherent and squeezed states and studying them in the conditions of Gaussian lossy and noisy channels. The influence of such a noise on the security of Gaussian quantum cryptography can be crucial, even despite the fact that a noise is trusted, due to a strongly nonlinear behavior of the quantum entropies involved in the security analysis. We recapitulate the known effect of the preparation noise in both direct and reverse-reconciliation protocols, as well as the detection noise in the reverse-reconciliation scenario. As a new result, we show the negative role of the trusted detection noise in the direct-reconciliation scheme. We also describe the role of the trusted preparation or detection noise added at the reference side of the protocols in improving the robustness of the protocols to the channel noise, confirming the positive effect for the coherent-state reverse-reconciliation protocol. Finally, we address the combined effect of trusted noise added both in the source and the detector.

We show that the RWA is a stable approximation with respect to pulse numbers: the timescale on which we can neglect terms rotating at the atomic frequency is negligibly affected by the number of pulses in the fast gate. In contrast, we show that the laser pulse instability does give rise to a pulse-number dependent effect; the fast gate infidelity is compounded with the number of applied imperfect pulses. Using a dimensional reduction method presented here, we find bounds on the pulse stability required to achieve two-qubit gate fidelity thresholds.

title: Is Nonlocality of the Quantum Theory Definitively Confirmed by the Experiments ?

abstract: In a recent paper published last october 2015 by B.Hensen et al. [1] and in two companion papers published last december 2015 by B.Hensen et al. [2] and by L. Shalm et al. [3], the authors describe beautiful and complex experiments aimed at testing the theorem of J. Bell (1965) [4] with measurements free of the detection-loophole and the locality loophole that had never been closed unquestionably in a single experiment. According to their authors, each experiment, closing both loopholes, gives conclusive evidence in favor of nonlocality. Here I will argue that this claim may be questionable, and that such an evidence should be obtained by a different kind of experiments.

abstract: We prove that the log-determinant of the covariance matrix obeys the strong subadditivity inequality for arbitrary tripartite states of multimode continuous variable quantum systems. This establishes general limitations on the distribution of information encoded in the second moments of canonically conjugate operators. We show that such an inequality implies a strict monogamy-type relation for joint Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steerability of single modes by Gaussian measurements performed on multiple groups of modes.

abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum coherence under Unruh thermal noise and seek under which condition the coherence can be frozen in a relativistic setting. We find that the quantum coherence can not be frozen for any acceleration due to the effect of Unruh thermal noise. We also find that quantum coherence is more robust than entanglement under the effect of Unruh thermal noise and therefore the coherence type quantum resources are more accessible for relativistic quantum information processing tasks. Besides, the dynamic of quantum coherence is found to be more sensitive than entanglement to the preparation of the detectors' initial state and the atom-field coupling strength, while it is less sensitive than entanglement to the acceleration of the detector.

abstract: State conversion between Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and W state is an open challenging problem because they cannot be converted to each other only by local operations and classical communication. Here we propose a cavity quantum electrodynamics method based on interference of polarized photons emitted by the atoms trapped in spatially separated optical cavities that can convert a three-atom W state to a GHZ state. We calculate the success probability and fidelity of the converted GHZ state when the cavity decay, atomic spontaneous decay, and photon leakage of the cavities are taken into account for a practical system, which shows that the proposed scheme is feasible and within the reach of current experimental technology.

abstract: Magnetic fields generated by human and animal organs, such as the heart, brain and nervous system carry information useful for biological and medical purposes. These magnetic fields are most commonly detected using cryogenically-cooled superconducting magnetometers. Here we present the frst detection of action potentials from an animal nerve using an optical atomic magnetometer. Using an optimal design we are able to achieve the sensitivity dominated by the quantum shot noise of light and quantum projection noise of atomic spins. Such sensitivity allows us to measure the nerve impulse with a miniature room-temperature sensor which is a critical advantage for biomedical applications. Positioning the sensor at a distance of a few millimeters from the nerve, corresponding to the distance between the skin and nerves in biological studies, we detect the magnetic field generated by an action potential of a frog sciatic nerve. From the magnetic field measurements we determine the activity of the nerve and the temporal shape of the nerve impulse. This work opens new ways towards implementing optical magnetometers as practical devices for medical diagnostics.

abstract: We propose to increase the fidelity of two-qubit resonator-induced phase gates in circuit QED by the use of narrowband single-mode squeezed drive. We show that there exists an optimal squeezing angle and strength that erases qubit 'which-path' information leaking out of the cavity and thereby minimizes qubit dephasing during these gates. Our analytical results for the gate fidelity are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations of a cascaded master equation that takes into account the dynamics of the source of squeezed radiation. With realistic parameters, we find that it is possible to realize a controlled-phase gate with a gate time of 200 ns and average infidelity of $10^{-5}$.

abstract: Training artificial neural networks requires a tedious empirical evaluation to determine a suitable neural network architecture. To avoid this empirical process several techniques have been proposed to automatise the architecture selection process. In this paper, we propose a method to perform parameter and architecture selection for a quantum weightless neural network (qWNN). The architecture selection is performed through the learning procedure of a qWNN with a learning algorithm that uses the principle of quantum superposition and a non-linear quantum operator. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it performs a global search in the space of qWNN architecture and parameters rather than a local search.

abstract: We show that there exist 35 choices for the coordinate transformation each leading to a separate eleven-parametric potential for which the stationary Schr\"odinger equation is exactly solvable in terms of the general Heun functions. Because of the symmetry of the Heun equation with respect to the transposition of its singularities only eleven of the potentials are independent. Four of these independent potentials are explicitly written in terms of elementary functions, one potential is given through the Jacobi elliptic sn-function, and the others are in general defined parametrically. Seven of the independent potentials possess exactly or conditionally integrable hypergeometric sub-potentials for which each of the fundamental solutions of the problem is written through a single hypergeometric function. Both these seven potentials and the remaining four that in general have solutions only in terms of irreducible general Heun functions possess conditionally integrable sub-potentials the general solution for which is written through fundamental solutions each of which is a linear combination of two or more hypergeometric functions.

abstract: Photon impingement is capable of liberating electrons in electronic devices and driving the electron flux from the lower chemical potential to higher chemical potential. Previous studies hinted that the thermodynamic efficiency of a nano-sized photoelectric converter at maximum power is bounded by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. In this study, we apply quantum effects to design a photoelectric converter based on a three-level quantum dot (QD) interacting with fermionic baths and photons. We show that, by adopting a pair of suitable degenerate states, quantum coherences induced by the couplings of quantum dots (QDs) to sunlight and fermion baths can coexist steadily in nano-electronic systems. Our analysis indicates that the efficiency at maximum power is no more limited to Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency through manipulation of carefully controlled quantum coherences.

In particular, it is shown that effective complex non-Hermitian hopping rates can be realized with only complex on-site energies in the network. Three applications of the Hamiltonian engineering method are presented: the synthesis of a nearly transparent defect in an Hermitian linear lattice; the realization of the Fano-Anderson model with complex coupling; and the synthesis of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric tight-binding lattice with a bound state in the continuum.

After a sudden change of the potential of some site, quantities like the survival probability of the particle in the initial Bloch state show cusps periodically. This phenomenon is a nonperturbative counterpart of the nonsmooth dynamics observed previously (Zhang and Haque, arXiv:1404.4280) in the tight binding model. We explain it by exactly solving a truncated and linearized model.

abstract: Symmetry is conventionally described in a contrariety manner that the system is either completely symmetric or completely asymmetric. Using group theoretical approach to overcome this dichotomous problem, we introduce the degree of symmetry (DoS) as a non-negative continuous number ranging from zero to unity. DoS is defined through an average of the fidelity deviations of Hamiltonian or quantum state over its transformation group G, and thus is computable by making use of the completeness relations of the irreducible representations of G. The monotonicity of DoS can effectively probe the extended group for accidental degeneracy while its multi-valued natures characterize some (spontaneous) symmetry breaking.

abstract: Although the quality of quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates has been steadily improving, the available quantity of qubits has increased quite slowly. To address this important issue in quantum computing, we have demonstrated arbitrary single qubit gates based on targeted phase shifts, an approach that can be applied to atom, ion or other atom-like systems. These gates are highly insensitive to addressing beam imperfections and have little crosstalk, allowing for a dramatic scaling up of qubit number. We have performed gates in series on 48 individually targeted sites in a 40% full $5\times 5\times 5$ 3D array created by an optical lattice. Using randomized benchmarking, we demonstrate an average gate fidelity of 0.9962(16), with an average crosstalk fidelity of 0.9979(2).

abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is a direct test of the quantum superposition principle for massive systems, and of collapse models. This is in contrast to non-interferometric tests, which are currently able to test collapse models more efficiently. However these bounds are in general model-dependent. Here we show that the bounds placed by matter-wave interferometry do not depend significantly on the type of collapse model. We also compute the current bounds, provided by the KDTLI 2013 experiment of Arndt's group.

abstract: Strong coupling of molecules to the vacuum field of micro cavities can modify the potential energy surfaces opening new photophysical and photochemical reaction pathways. While the influence of laser fields is usually described in terms of classical field, coupling to the vacuum state of a cavity has to be described in terms of dressed photon-matter states (polaritons) which require quantized fields. We present a derivation of the non-adiabatic couplings for single molecules in the strong coupling regime suitable for the calculation of the dressed state dynamics. The formalism allows to use quantities readily accessible from quantum chemistry codes like the adiabatic potential energy surfaces and dipole moments to carry out wave packet simulations in the dressed basis. The implications for photochemistry are demonstrated for a set of model systems representing typical situations found in molecules.

abstract: We consider the problem of computing, for a detector waiting for a quantum particle to arrive, the probability distribution of the time at which the detector clicks, from the initial wave function of the particle in the non-relativistic regime. Although the standard rules of quantum mechanics offer no operator for the time of arrival, quantum mechanics makes an unambiguous prediction for this distribution, defined by first solving the Schrodinger equation for the big quantum system formed by the particle of interest, the detector, a clock, and a device that records the time when the detector clicks, then making a quantum measurement of the record at a very late time, and finally using the distribution of the recorded time. This leads to question whether there is also a practical, simple rule for computing this distribution, at least approximately (i.e., for an idealized detector). We argue here in favor of a rule based on a 1-particle Schrodinger equation with a certain (absorbing) boundary condition at the ideal detecting surface, first considered by Werner in 1987. We present a novel derivation of this rule and describe how it arises as a limit of a "soft" detector represented by an imaginary potential.

abstract: We quantify and analyze the controller's power in controlled remote state preparation schemes. Our analysis provides a lower bound on the control power required for controlled remote preparation of arbitrary D-dimensional states. We evaluate several existing controlled remote state preparation protocols and show that some proposed non-maximally entangled channels are not suitable for perfect controlled remote preparation of arbitrary quantum states from the con- troller's point of view. We find that for remotely preparing D-dimensional states, the entropy of each controller should be no less than log_2 D bits. Our criteria are not only useful for evaluating controlled remote state preparation schemes but can also be used for other controlled quantum communication schemes.

abstract: Macroscopic realism is the name for a class of modifications to quantum theory that allow macroscopic objects to be described in a measurement-independent fashion, while largely preserving a fully quantum mechanical description of the microscopic world. Objective collapse theories are examples which attempt to provide a physical mechanism for wavefunction collapse, and thereby aim to solve the quantum measurement problem. Here we describe and implement an experimental protocol capable of constraining theories of this class, and show how it is related to the original Leggett-Garg test, yet more noise tolerant and conceptually transparent. By conducting a set of simple 'prepare, shuffle, measure' tests in a superconducting flux qubit, we rule out (by over 83 standard deviations) those theories which would deny coherent superpositions of 170 nA currents over a 9 ns timescale. Further, we address the 'clumsiness loophole' by determining classical disturbance in a set of control experiments.

The maximally hyperentangled state, in which $N$ particles are entangled simultaneously in the polarization and the spatial mode, can be obtained with a certain probability from two partially hyperentangled states. The hyperconcentration scheme is based on one polarization parity check measurement, one spatial mode parity check measurement and N-2 single-photon two-qubit measurements. The concentration only requires linear optical elements, which makes it feasible and practical with current technology.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.03756
abstract: We propose two schemes for concentration of hyperentanglement of nonlocal multipartite states which are simultaneously entangled in the polarization and spatial modes. One scheme uses an auxiliary singlephoton state prepared according to the parameters of the less-entangled states. The other scheme uses two less-entangled states with unknown parameters to distill the maximal hyperentanglement. The procrustean concentration is realized by two parity check measurements in both the two degrees of freedom. Nondestructive quantum nondemolition detectors based on cross-Kerr nonlinearity are used to implement the parity check, which makes the unsuccessful instances reusable in the next concentration round. The success probabilities in both schemes can be made to approach unity by iteration. Moreover, in both schemes only one of the N parties has to perform the parity check measurements. Our schemes are efficient and useful for quantum information processing involving hyperentanglement.

abstract: Quantifying coherence is an essential endeavour for both quantum foundations and quantum technologies. Here the robustness of coherence is defined and proven a full monotone in the context of the recently introduced resource theories of quantum coherence. The measure is shown to be observable, as it can be recast as the expectation value of a coherence witness operator for any quantum state. The robustness of coherence is evaluated analytically on relevant classes of states, and an efficient semidefinite program that computes it on general states is given. An operational interpretation is finally provided: the robustness of coherence quantifies the advantage enabled by a quantum state in a phase-discrimination task.

abstract: Quantum states may exhibit asymmetry with respect to the action of a given group. Such an asymmetry of states can be considered as a resource in applications such as quantum metrology, and it is a concept that encompasses quantum coherence as a special case. We introduce explicitly and study the robustness of asymmetry, a quantifier of asymmetry of states that we prove to have many attractive properties, including efficient numerical computability via semidefinite programming, and an operational interpretation in a channel discrimination context. We also introduce the notion of asymmetry witnesses, whose measurement in a laboratory detects the presence of asymmetry. We prove that properly constrained asymmetry witnesses provide lower bounds to the robustness of asymmetry, which is shown to be a directly measurable quantity itself. We then focus our attention on coherence witnesses and the robustness of coherence, for which we prove a number of additional results; these include an analysis of its specific relevance in phase discrimination and quantum metrology, an analytical calculation of its value for a relevant class of quantum states, and tight bounds that relate it to another previously defined coherence monotone.

abstract: We derive from first principles the momentum exchange between a photon and a quantum mirror upon reflection, by considering the boundary conditions imposed by the mirror surface on the photon wave equation. We show that the system generally ends up in an entangled state, unless the mirror position uncertainty is much smaller than the photon wavelength, when the mirror behaves classically. Our treatment leads us directly to the conclusion that the photon momentum has the known value hk/2{\pi}. This implies that when the mirror is immersed in a dielectric medium the photon radiation pressure is proportional to the medium refractive index n. Our work thus contributes to the longstanding Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium. We interpret the result by associating the Minkowski momentum (which is proportional to n) with the canonical momentum of light, which appears naturally in quantum formulations.

abstract: Electron behaviors in graphene have revived research interests on the behaviors of Dirac particles in recent years. Moreover, localization of relativistic particles have been of great research interests over many decades. We investigate the time evolution of the Gaussian wave packets governed by the one dimensional Dirac equation. For the free Dirac equation, we obtain the evolution profiles analytically in many approximation regimes, and numerical simulations consistent with other numerical schemes. Interesting behaviors such as the Klein-paradox and the Zitterbewegung behaviors are observed. In particular, the dispersion rate as a function of mass is calculated, and it yields a surprising result the super-massive and massless particle both exhibit no dispersion in free space. For the Dirac equation with random potential or mass, we employ the numerical algorithm to investigate the probability profiles of the displacement distribution when the potential is uniformly distributed. We observe that the widths of the Gaussian wave packets decrease rapidly as the randomness strength increases. This suggests an onset of localization, but it is weaker than Anderson localization.

abstract: We describe a setup for obtaining uncertainty relations for arbitrary pairs of observables related by Fourier transform. The physical examples discussed here are standard position and momentum, number and angle, finite qudit systems, and strings of qubits for quantum information applications. The uncertainty relations allow an arbitrary choice of metric for the distance of outcomes, and the choice of an exponent distinguishing e.g., absolute or root mean square deviations. The emphasis of the article is on developing a unified treatment, in which one observable takes values in an arbitrary locally compact abelian group and the other in the dual group. In all cases the phase space symmetry implies the equality of measurement uncertainty bounds and preparation uncertainty bounds, and there is a straightforward method for determining the optimal bounds.

abstract: We address the question of how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which a detector clicks, in the situation of $n$ non-relativistic quantum particles in a volume $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ in physical space and detectors placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$ of $\Omega$. We have recently [this http URL] argued in favor of a rule for the 1-particle case that involves a Schr\"odinger equation with an absorbing boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ introduced by Werner; we call this rule the "absorbing boundary rule." Here, we describe the natural extension of the absorbing boundary rule to the $n$-particle case. A key element of this extension is that, upon a detection event, the wave function gets collapsed by inserting the detected position, at the time of detection, into the wave function, thus yielding a wave function of $n-1$ particles. We also describe an extension of the absorbing boundary rule to the case of moving detectors.

abstract: Coherent conversion of microwave and optical photons in the single-quantum level can significantly expand our ability to process signals in various fields. Efficient up-conversion of a feeble signal in the microwave domain to the optical domain will lead to quantum-noise-limited microwave amplifiers. Coherent exchange between optical photons and microwave photons will also be a stepping stone to realize long-distance quantum communication. Here we demonstrate bidirectional and coherent conversion between microwave and light using collective spin excitations in a ferromagnet. The converter consists of two harmonic oscillator modes, a microwave cavity mode and a magnetostatic mode called Kittel mode, where microwave photons and magnons in the respective modes are strongly coupled and hybridized. An itinerant microwave field and a travelling optical field can be coupled through the hybrid system, where the microwave field is coupled to the hybrid system through the cavity mode, while the optical field addresses the hybrid system through the Kittel mode via Faraday and inverse Faraday effects. The conversion efficiency is theoretically analyzed and experimentally evaluated. The possible schemes for improving the efficiency are also discussed.

abstract: The quantification of quantum coherence has attracted a growing attention, and based on various physical contexts, several coherence measures have been put forward. An interesting question is whether these coherence measures give the same ordering when they are used to quantify the coherence of quantum states. In this paper, we consider the two well-known coherence measures, the $l_1$ norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence, to show that there are the states for which the two measures give a different ordering. Our analysis can be extended to other coherence measures, and as an illustration of the extension we further consider the formation of coherence to show that the $l_1$ norm of coherence and the formation of coherence, as well as the relative entropy of coherence and the coherence of formation, do not give the same ordering too.

abstract: As the generation of squeezed states of light has become a standard technique in laboratories, attention is increasingly directed towards adapting the optical parameters of squeezed beams to the specific requirements of individual applications. It is known that imaging, metrology, and quantum information may benefit from using squeezed light with a tailored transverse spatial mode. However, experiments have so far been limited to generating only a few squeezed spatial modes within a given setup. Here, we present the generation of single-mode squeezing in Laguerre-Gauss and Bessel-Gauss modes, as well as an arbitrary intensity pattern, all from a single setup using a spatial light modulator (SLM). The degree of squeezing obtained is limited mainly by the initial squeezing and diffractive losses introduced by the SLM, while no excess noise from the SLM is detectable at the measured sideband. The experiment illustrates the single-mode concept in quantum optics and demonstrates the viability of current SLMs as flexible tools for the spatial reshaping of squeezed light.

abstract: We discuss the recently observed "loophole free" violation of Bell's inequalities in the framework of a physically realist view of quantum mechanics, which requires that physical properties are attributed jointly to a system, and to the context in which it is embedded. This approach, close to the usual Copenhagen point of view, is clearly different from classical realism, but nevertheless quite acceptable as being "realistic" from a general philosophical point of view. In agreement with Bell test experiments, this quantum realism embeds some form of non-locality, but does not contain any action at a distance, again in agreement with quantum mechanics.

abstract: We give a simple demonstration that the Schr\"odinger equation may be recast as a self-contained second-order Newtonian law for a congruence of spacetime trajectories. This provides a pictorial representation of the quantum state as the displacement function of the collective whereby quantum evolution is represented as the deterministic unfolding of a continuous coordinate transformation. Introducing gauge potentials for the density and current density it is shown that the wave-mechanical and trajectory pictures are connected by a canonical transformation. The canonical trajectory theory is shown to provide an alternative basis for the quantum operator calculus and the issue of the observability of the quantum state is examined within this context. The construction illuminates some of the problems involved in connecting the quantum and classical descriptions.

abstract: We address characterization of many-body superradiant systems and establish a fundamental connection between quantum criticality and the possibility of locally estimating the coupling constant, i.e extracting its value by probing only a portion of the whole system. In particular, we consider Dicke-like superradiant systems made of an ensmble of two-level atoms interacting with a single-mode radiation field at zero effective temperature, and address estimation of the coupling by measurements performed only on radiation. At first, we obtain analytically the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and show that optimal estimation of the coupling may be achieved by tuning the frequency of the radiation field to drive the system towards criticality. The scaling behavior of the QFI at the critical point is obtained explicitly upon exploiting the symplectic formalism for Gaussian states. We then analyze the performances of feasible detection schemes performed only on the radiation subsystem, namely homodyne detection and photon counting, and show that the corresponding Fisher Informations (FIs) approach the global QFI in the critical region. We thus conclude that criticality is a twofold resource. On the one hand, global QFI diverges at the critical point, i.e. the coupling may be estimated with the arbitrary precision. On the other hand, the FIs of feasible local measurements, (which are generally smaller than the QFI out of the critical region), show the same scaling of the global QFI, i.e. optimal estimation of coupling may be achieved by locally probing the system, despite its strongly interacting nature.

abstract: Fabrication processes involving anhydrous hydrofluoric vapor etching are developed to create high-$Q$ aluminum superconducting microwave resonators on free-standing silicon membranes formed from a silicon-on-insulator wafer. Using this fabrication process, a high-impedance $8.9$GHz coil resonator is coupled capacitively with large participation ratio to a $9.7$MHz micromechanical resonator. Two-tone microwave spectroscopy and radiation pressure back-action are used to characterize the coupled system in a dilution refrigerator down to temperatures of $T_f = 11$~mK, yielding a measured electromechanical vacuum coupling rate of $g_{0}/2\pi \approx 24.6$~Hz and a mechanical resonator $Q$-factor of $Q_{m}=1.7\times 10^7$. Microwave back-action cooling of the mechanical resonator is also studied, with a minimum phonon occupancy of $n_{m} \approx 16$ phonons being realized at an elevated fridge temperature of $T_f = 211$~mK.

abstract: Any pure two-qubit state can be represented by six real angles, with a natural parameterization indicated by the bipartite structure. After explicitly identifying all of these angles for the first time, it is found that the parameters can always be completely separated into two "dynamically local" spinor components. Specifically, given local Hamiltonians at the locations of the two qubits, unitary dynamics on each spinor can be implemented separately without losing any entanglement information in the full state. Such a conclusion also follows from a phase-fixed version of the Schmidt decomposition.

abstract: The Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian of a spin zero particle as well as the Pauli Hamiltonian with spin-orbit coupling included of a spin one-half particle in electromagnetic fields that are confined to a curved surface embedded in a three-dimensional space spanned by a general Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinate (OCC) are constructed. A new approach, based on the physical argument that upon squeezing the particle to the surface by a potential, then it is the physical gauge-covariant kinematical momentum operator (velocity operator) transverse to the surface that should be dropped from the Hamiltonian(s). In both cases,the resulting Hermitian gauge-invariant Hamiltonian on the surface is free from any reference to the component of the vector potential transverse to the surface, and the approach is completely gauge-independent. In particular, for the Pauli Hamiltonian these results are obtained exactly without any further assumptions or approximations. Explicit covariant plug-and-play formulae for the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians on the surfaces of a cylinder, a sphere and a torus are derived.

abstract: Preparing highly entangled quantum states between remote parties is a major challenge for quantum communications [1-8]. Particularly promising in this context are the N00N states, which are entangled N-photon wavepackets delocalized between two different locations, providing measurement sensitivity limited only by the uncertainty principle [1, 10-15]. However, these states are notoriously vulnerable to losses, making it difficult both to share them between remote locations, and to recombine them to exploit interference effects. Here we address this challenge by utilizing the reverse version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect [16] to prepare a high-fidelity two-photon N00N state shared between two parties connected by a lossy optical channel. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the enhanced phase sensitivity can be directly exploited in the two distant locations, and we remotely prepare superpositions of coherent states, known as Schr\"odinger's cat states" [17, 18].

abstract: We study measures of decoherence and thermalization of a quantum system $S$ in the presence of a quantum environment (bath) $E$. The entirety $S$$+$$E$ is prepared in a canonical thermal state at a finite temperature, that is the entirety is in a steady state. Both our numerical results and theoretical predictions show that measures of the decoherence and the thermalization of $S$ are generally finite, even in the thermodynamic limit, when the entirety $S$$+$$E$ is at finite temperature. Notably, applying perturbation theory with respect to the system-environment coupling strength, we find that under common Hamiltonian symmetries, up to first order in the coupling strength it is sufficient to consider $S$ uncoupled from $E$, but entangled with $E$, to predict decoherence and thermalization measures of $S$. This decoupling allows closed form expressions for perturbative expansions for the measures of decoherence and thermalization in terms of the free energies of $S$ and of $E$. Large-scale numerical results for both coupled and uncoupled entireties with up to 40 quantum spins support these findings.

abstract: The Johnson graph $J(n,k)$ is defined by $n$ symbols, where vertices are $k$-element subsets of the symbols, and vertices are adjacent if they differ in exactly one symbol. In particular, $J(n,1)$ is the complete graph $K_n$, and $J(n,2)$ is the strongly regular triangular graph $T_n$, both of which are known to support fast spatial search by continuous-time quantum walk. In this paper, we prove that $J(n,3)$, which is the $n$-tetrahedral graph, also supports fast search. In the process, we show that a change of basis is needed for degenerate perturbation theory to accurately describe the dynamics. This method can also be applied to general Johnson graphs $J(n,k)$ with fixed $k$.

abstract: Using the Gell-Mann and Hartle formalism of generalized quantum mechanics of closed systems, we study the classical limit of coarse-grained spacetime histories and their decoherence. The system under consideration is one-dimensional and consists of a particle coupled to a von Neumann apparatus that performs a measurement of the position of the particle during the finite time interval during which the histories of this system take place. We consider two cases: a free particle and a harmonic oscillator. The real line is divided into intervals of the same length, and coarse-grained histories are defined by the time average of the position of the particle on a given Feynman path to be within one of these intervals. The position of the pointer in each Feynman path correlates with this time average. The class operators for this system have been evaluated, and the decoherence functional shows that these coarse-grained histories do not decohere, not even when initially either the particle or the pointer is in an eigenstate of position. Decoherence is obtained only when the classical limit is taken. Qualitative arguments for decoherence in the classical limit are presented for the case of a general particle potential.

abstract: Optical quantum memory is an essential element for long distance quantum communication and photonic quantum computation protocols. The practical implementation of such protocols requires an efficient quantum memory with long coherence time. Beating the no-cloning limit, for example, requires efficiencies above 50\%. An ideal optical fibre loop has a loss of 50% in 100 $\mu$ s, and until now no universal quantum memory has beaten this time-efficiency limit. Here, we report results of a gradient echo memory (GEM) experiment in a cold atomic ensemble with a 1/e coherence time up to 1ms and maximum efficiency up to 87$\pm$2% for short storage times. Our experimental data demonstrates greater than 50% efficiency for storage times up to 0.6ms. Quantum storage ability is verified beyond the ideal fibre limit using heterodyne tomography of small coherent states.

abstract: Observables are believed that they must be Hermitian in quantum theory. Based on the obviously physical fact that only eigenstates of observable and its corresponding probabilities, i.e., spectrum distribution of observable are actually observed, we argue that observables need not necessarily to be Hermitian. More generally, observables should be reformulated as normal operators including Hermitian operators as a subclass. This reformulation is consistent with the quantum theory currently used and does not change any physical results. The Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality is taken as an example to show that our opinion does not conflict with conventional quantum theory and gives the same physical results. Reformulation of observables as normal operators not only coincides with the physical facts but also will deepen our understanding of measurement in quantum theory.

We moreover analyze the breakdown of the cooling cycle for strongly nonadiabatic driving protocols and derive analytical estimates for the minimal driving time allowed for cooling.

abstract: This paper deals with the problem of identifying and estimating dynamical parameters of continuous-time quantum open systems, in the input-output formalism. First, we characterise the space of identifiable parameters for ergodic dynamics, assuming full access to the output state for arbitrarily long times, and show that the equivalence classes of undistinguishable parameters are orbits of a Lie group acting on the space of dynamical parameters. Second, we define an information geometric structure on this space, including a principal bundle given by the action of the group, as well as a compatible connection, and a Riemannian metric based on the quantum Fisher information of the output. We compute the metric explicitly in terms of the Markov covariance of certain "fluctuation operators", and relate it to the horizontal bundle of the connection. Third, we show that the system-output and reduced output state satisfy local asymptotic normality, i.e. they can be approximated by a Gaussian model consisting of coherent states of a multimode continuos variables system constructed from the Markov covariance "data". We illustrate the result by working out the details of the information geometry of a physically relevant two-level system.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering allows two parties to verify their entanglement, even if one party's measurements are untrusted. This concept has not only provided new insights into the nature of non-local spatial correlations in quantum mechanics, but also serves as a resource for one-sided device-independent quantum information tasks. Here, we investigate how EPR steering behaves when one-half of a maximally-entangled pair of qudits (multidimensional quantum systems) is cloned by a universal cloning machine. We find that EPR steering, as verified by a criterion based on the mutual information between qudits, can only be found in one of the copy subsystems but not both. We prove that this is also true for the single-system analogue of EPR steering. We find that this restriction, which we term "no-cloning of quantum steering", elucidates the physical reason why steering can be used to secure sources and channels against cloning-based attacks when implementing quantum communication and quantum computation protocols.

abstract: In this work we offer an approach to protect the entanglement based on the anti-symmetric property of the hamiltonian. Our main objective is to protect the entanglement of a given initial three-qubit state which is governed by hamiltonian of a three-spin Ising chain in site-dependent transverse fields. We show that according to anti-symmetric property of the hamiltonian with respect to some operators mimicking the time reversal operator, the dynamics of the system can be effectively reversed. It equips us to control the dynamics of the system. The control procedure is implemented as a sequence of cyclic evolution; accordingly the entanglement of the system is protected for any given initial state with any desired accuracy an long-time. Using this approach we could control not only the multiparty entanglement but also the pairwise entanglement. It is also notable that in this paper although we restrict ourselves mostly within a three-spin Ising chain in site-dependent transverse fields, our approach could be applicable to any n-qubit spin system models.

abstract: Measurement and estimation of parameters are essential for science and engineering, where the main quest is to find out the highest achievable precision with given resources and design schemes that attain that precision. Two schemes, the sequential feedback scheme and the parallel scheme, are usually considered in quantum parameter estimation, although the sequential feedback scheme is more general, it remained unclear whether it can ever outperform the parallel scheme for any practical quantum parameter estimation tasks. In this article we study the problem of simultaneously estimating all three components of a magnetic field, which is a key problem in quantum parameter estimation. We show that, contrary to the conventional belief, it is possible to simultaneously achieve the highest precision in estimating all three parameters of a magnetic field. The precision is obtained by optimizing all steps of the estimation procedure, thus represents the ultimate precision for estimating all components of a magnetic field. Our results also show that the sequential feedback scheme can outperform the parallel scheme in quantum parameter estimation which sheds light on the comparison between these two schemes.

abstract: We first show that partial transposition for pure and mixed two-particle states in a discrete $N$-dimensional Hilbert space is equivalent to a change in sign of the momentum of one of the particles in the Wigner function for the state. We then show that it is possible to formulate an uncertainty relation for two-particle Hermitian operators constructed in terms of Schwinger operators, and study its role in detecting entanglement in a two-particle state: the violation of the uncertainty relation for a partially transposed state implies that the original state is entangled. This generalizes a result obtained for continuous-variable systems to the discrete-variable-system case. This is significant because testing entanglement in terms of an uncertainty relation has a physically appealing interpretation. We study the case of a Werner state, which is a mixed state constructed as a convex combination with a parameter $r$ of a Bell state $|\Phi^{+} \rangle$ and the completely incoherent state, $\hat{\rho}_r = r |\Phi^{+} \rangle \langle \Phi^{+}| + (1-r)\frac{\hat{\mathbb{I}}}{N^2}$: we find that for $r_0 < r < 1$, where $r_0$ is obtained as a function of the dimensionality $N$, the uncertainty relation for the partially transposed Werner state is violated and the original Werner state is entangled.

abstract: We study the resonance interaction between two uniformly accelerated identical atoms, one excited and the other in the ground state, prepared in a correlated (symmetric or antisymmetric) state and interacting with the scalar field in the vacuum state. Because the two atoms are in a correlated state, the interaction is a second-order effect in the atom-field coupling. We separate the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the resonance energy shift of the system, and show that only radiation reaction contributes, while Unruh thermal fluctuations do not affect the resonant interatomic interaction. We also find that beyond a characteristic length scale associated to the breakdown of a local inertial description of the two-atom system, non-thermal effects in the radiation reaction correction change the distance-dependence of the resonance interaction. Finally, we generalize our model to the case of atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field, and shown that new features appear in the resonance interaction, as a consequence of the peculiar anisotropic nature of the vacuum quantum noise of the electromagnetic field in a relativistically accelerated background.

abstract: The problem of detection time distribution concerns a quantum particle surrounded by detectors and consists of computing the probability distribution of where and when the particle will be detected. While the correct answer can be obtained in principle by solving the Schrodinger equation of particle and detectors together, a more practical answer should involve a simple rule representing the behavior of idealized detectors. We have argued elsewhere [this http URL] that the most natural rule for this purpose is the "absorbing boundary rule," based on the 1-particle Schrodinger equation with a certain "absorbing" boundary condition, first considered by Werner in 1987, at the ideal detecting surface. Here we develop a relativistic variant of this rule using the Dirac equation and also a boundary condition. We treat one or several detectable particles, in flat or curved space-time, with stationary or moving detectors.

abstract: Classical optomechanical systems feature self-sustained oscillations, where multiple periodic orbits at different amplitudes coexist. We study how this multistability is realized in the quantum regime, where new dynamical patterns appear because quantum trajectories can move between different classical orbits. We explain the resulting quantum dynamics from the phase space point of view, and provide a quantitative description in terms of autocorrelation functions. In this way we can identify clear dynamical signatures of the crossover from classical to quantum mechanics in experimentally accessible quantities. Finally, we discuss a possible interpretation of our results in the sense that quantum mechanics protects optomechanical systems against the chaotic dynamics realized in the classical limit.

abstract: A recent paper from Brun et al. has argued that access to a closed timelike curve (CTC) would allow for the possibility of perfectly distinguishing nonorthogonal quantum states. This result can be used to develop a protocol for instantaneous nonlocal signaling. Several commenters have argued that nonlocal signaling must fail in this and in similar cases, often citing consistency with relativity as the justification. I argue that this objection fails to rule out nonlocal signaling in the presence of a CTC. I argue that the reason these authors are motivated to exclude the prediction of nonlocal signaling is because the No Signaling principle is considered to a fundamental part of the formulation of the quantum information approach. I draw out the relationship between nonlocal signaling, quantum information, and relativity, and argue that the principle theory formulation of quantum mechanics, which is at the foundation of the quantum information approach, is in tension with foundational assumptions of Deutsch's D-CTC model, on which this protocol is based.

abstract: A number of recent studies have investigated the introduction of decoherence in quantum walks and the resulting transition to classical random walks. Interestingly, it has been shown that algorithmic properties of quantum walks with decoherence such as the spreading rate are sometimes better than their purely quantum counterparts. Not only quantum walks with decoherence provide a generalization of quantum walks that naturally encompasses both the quantum and classical case, but they also give rise to new and different probability distribution. The application of quantum walks with decoherence to large graphs is limited by the necessity of evolving a state vector whose size is quadratic in the number of nodes of the graph, as opposed to the linear state vector of the purely quantum (or classical) case. In this technical report, we show how to use perturbation theory to reduce the computational complexity of evolving a continuous-time quantum walk subject to decoherence. More specifically, given a graph over n nodes, we show how to approximate the eigendecomposition of the n^2 x n^2 Lindblad super-operator from the eigendecomposition of the n x n graph Hamiltonian.

abstract: Anyons, quasiparticles living in two-dimensional spaces with exotic exchange statistics, can serve as the fundamental units for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, experimentally demonstrating anyonic statistics is a challenge due to the technical limitations of current experimental platforms. Here, we take a state perpetration approach to mimic anyons in the Kitaev lattice model using a 7-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator. Anyons are created by dynamically preparing the ground and excited states of the 7-qubit Kitaev lattice model, and are subsequently braided along two distinct, but topologically equivalent, paths. We observe that the phase acquired by the anyons is independent of the path, and coincides with the ideal theoretical predictions when decoherence and implementation errors are taken into account. As the first demonstration of the topological path independence of anyons, our experiment helps to study and exploit the anyonic properties towards the goal of building a topological quantum computer.

abstract: The aim of this article is a comprehensive description of normal modes of molecular vibrations. The starting point is chosen to be a general molecular system with separated center of mass and an arbitrary embedding of body-fixed axes. This allows to focus on internal degrees of freedom only, leaving the problem of rotational motion behind. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness we first introduce a general quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian in Eckart-Watson representation, to make a quick leap into a simplified harmonic description for internal motion and rigid rotor for rotational degrees of freedom. This regime constitutes a basis for more sophisticated calculations.

abstract: A master equation has been constructed for a global system-bath interaction both in the absence as well as presence of non-Markovian noise. The master equation has been exactly solved for a special class of two qubit X states (which contains Bell diagonal and Werner states). The $l_1$ norm of coherence has been calculated to observe the dynamics of quantum coherence in the presence of a global system-bath interaction. We show that the global part of the system-bath interaction compensates for the decoherence, resulting in the slow down of coherence decay. The concurrence and the Fisher information, explicitly calculated for a particular two qubit Werner state, indicate that the decay of these quantum features also slow down under a global system-bath interaction. We also show that the coherence is the most robust of all the three non-classical features under environmental interaction. Entanglement is shown to be the most costly of them all. For an appropriately defined limiting case, all the three quantities show freezing behaviour. This limiting condition is attainable when the separations between the energy levels of both the atomic qubits are small.

abstract: Modern applications in quantum computation and quantum communication require the precise characterization of quantum states and quantum channels. In practice, this means that one has to determine the quantum capacity of a physical system in terms of measurable quantities. Witnesses, if properly constructed, succeed in performing this task. We derive a method that is capable to compute witnesses for identifying deterministic evolutions and measurement-induced collapse processes. At the same time, applying the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, it uncovers the entanglement characteristics of bipartite quantum states. Remarkably, a statistical mixture of unitary evolutions is mapped onto mixtures of maximally entangled states, and classical separable states originate from genuine quantum-state reduction maps. Based on our treatment we are able to witness these opposing attributes at once and, furthermore, obtain an insight into their different geometric structures. The complementarity is further underpinned by formulating a complementary Schmidt decomposition of a state in terms of maximally entangled states and discrete Fourier-transformed Schmidt coefficients.

abstract: After leading to a new axiomatic derivation of quantum theory, the new informational paradigm is entering the domain of quantum field theory, suggesting a quantum automata framework that can be regarded as an extension of quantum field theory to including an hypothetical Planck scale, and with the usual quantum field theory recovered in the relativistic limit of small wave-vectors. Being derived from simple principles (linearity, unitarity, locality, homogeneity, isotropy, and minimality of dimension), the automata theory is quantum ab-initio, and does not assume Lorentz covariance and mechanical notions. Being discrete it can describe localized states and measurements (unmanageable by quantum field theory), solving all the issues plaguing field theory originated from the continuum. These features make the theory an ideal framework for quantum gravity, with relativistic covariance and space-time emergent solely from the interactions, and not assumed a priori. The paper presents a synthetic derivation of the automata theory, showing how from the principles lead to a description in terms of a quantum automaton over a Cayley graph of a group. Restricting to Abelian groups we show how the automata recover the Weyl, Dirac and Maxwell dynamics in the relativistic limit. We conclude with some new routes about the more general scenario of non-Abelian Cayley graphs.

abstract: Recent advances on quantum foundations achieved the derivation of free quantum field theory from general principles, without referring to mechanical notions and relativistic invariance. From the aforementioned principles a quantum cellular automata (QCA) theory follows, whose relativistic limit of small wave-vector provides the free dynamics of quantum field theory. The QCA theory can be regarded as an extended quantum field theory that describes in a unified way all scales ranging from an hypothetical discrete Planck scale up to the usual Fermi scale. The present paper reviews the elementary automaton theory for the Weyl field, and the composite automata for Dirac and Maxwell fields. We then give a simple analysis of the dynamics in the momentum space in terms of a dispersive differential equation for narrowband wave-packets, and some account on the position space description in terms of a discrete path-integral approach. We then review the phenomenology of the free-field automaton and consider possible visible effects arising from the discreteness of the framework. We conclude introducing the consequences of the automaton distorted dispersion relation, leading to a deformed Lorentz covariance and to possible effects on the thermodynamics of ideal gases.

The cornerstone of our approach is a generalization of the Choi isomorphism that allows one to efficiently represent any given Quantum Network in terms of a single positive operator. Our formalism allows one to face and solve many quantum information processing problems that would be hardly manageable otherwise, the most relevant of which are reviewed in this work: quantum process tomography, quantum cloning and learning of transformations, inversion of a unitary gate, information-disturbance tradeoff in estimating a unitary transformation, cloning and learning of a measurement device.

abstract: Every finite simple group P can be generated by two of its elements. Pairs of generators for P are available in the Atlas of finite group representations as (not neccessarily minimal) permutation representations P. It is unusual but significant to recognize that a P is a Grothendieck's dessin d'enfant D and that most standard graphs and finite geometries G-such as near polygons and their generalizations-are stabilized by a D. In our paper, tripods P -- D -- G of rank larger than two, corresponding to simple groups, are organized into classes, e.g. symplectic, unitary, sporadic, etc (as in the Atlas). An exhaustive search and characterization of non-trivial point-line configurations defined from small index representations of simple groups is performed, with the goal to recognize their quantum physical significance. All the defined geometries G' s have a contextuality parameter close to its maximal value 1.

The invariant naturally splits into a symplectic entanglement monotone and local nonclassicality quantifiers applied to the reduced states. Twin beams and their transformations at a beam splitter are analyzed as an example providing squeezed light. An extension of this approach to three-mode Gaussian states is discussed.

abstract: Feynman's prescription for a quantum computer was to find a Hamitonian for a system that could serve as a computer. Here we concentrate in a system to solve the problem of decomposing a large number $N$ into its prime factors. The spectrum of this computer is exactly calculated obtaining the factors of $N$ from the arithmetic function that represents the energy of the computer. As a corollary, in the semi-classical large $N$ limit, we compute a new prime counting asymptote $\pi(x|N)$, where $x$ is a candidate to factorize $N$, that has no counterpart in analytic number theory. This rises the conjecture that the quantum solution of factoring obtains prime numbers, thus reaching consistency with Euclid's unique factorization theorem: primes should be quantum numbers of a Feynman's factoring simulator.

abstract: Coherent scattering of light from ultracold atoms involves an exchange of energy and momentum introducing a wealth of non-linear dynamical phenomena. As a prominent example particles can spontaneously form stationary periodic configurations which simultaneously maximize the light scattering and minimize the atomic potential energy in the emerging optical lattice. Such self-ordering effects resulting in periodic lattices via bimodal symmetry breaking have been experimentally observed with cold gases and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) inside an optical resonator. Here we study a new regime of periodic pattern formation for an atomic BEC in free space, driven by far off-resonant counterpropagating and non-interfering lasers of orthogonal polarization. In contrast to previous works, no spatial light modes are preselected by any boundary conditions and the transition from homogeneous to periodic order amounts to a crystallization of both light and ultracold atoms breaking a continuous translational symmetry. In the crystallized state the BEC acquires a phase similar to a supersolid with an emergent intrinsic length scale whereas the light-field forms an optical lattice allowing phononic excitations via collective back scattering. The studied system constitutes a novel configuration allowing the simulation of synthetic solid state systems with ultracold atoms including long-range phonon dynamics.

abstract: A high efficiency method for the generation of correlated photon pairs accompanied by a reliable means to characterize the efficiency of that process is needed in the study of correlated photon pairs and entangled states involving more than three photons, which have important potential applications in quantum information and quantum communication. In this study, we report the first characterization of the efficiency of generation of correlated photon pairs emitted from a CuCl single crystal using the biexciton-resonance hyper-parametric scattering (RHPS) method which is the highly efficient method of generation of correlated photon pairs. In order to characterize the generation efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio of correlated photon pairs using this method, we investigated the excitation density dependence on the photon counting rate and coincidence counting rate under resonant excitation. The excitation density dependence shows that the power characteristics of the photon counting rates changes from linear to quadratic dependence of the excitation density. This behavior represents a superposition of contributions from correlated photon pairs and non-correlated photons. Photon counting signals in this study were recorded as time-tag data, which provide the photon counting rate and coincidence counting rate simultaneously, and improve the coincidence counting rate by the factor of 200 compared to that obtained in previous work [K. Edamatsu $\it{et\ al}$. Nature $\bf{431}$, 167-170 (2004)]. The analysis of the excitation density dependence shows that one photon-pair is produced by a pump pulse with $2 \times 10^6$ photons. Moreover, the generation efficiency of this method is improved by a factor of $10^7$ compared to that of several methods based on the $\chi^{(3)}$ parametric process.

The treatment of the problem is based on the introduction, in analogy with atomic polarizability, of state-dependent non-permanent multi-pole moments for the charge. The diffraction patterns can provide bounds on these moments. With this approach we can experimentally explore some aspects of the interpretation of the wave picture of single charges.

abstract: We have measured a low optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 25 MHz in the stoichiometric rare earth crystal EuCl3.6H2O by isotopically purifying the crystal in 35Cl. The hyperfine levels of 153Eu3+ are spectrally resolved and retain their long coherence times, allowing the whole population of 153Eu3+ ions to be prepared in the same hyperfine state using hole burning techniques. Combined with this ability, the crystal has two useful properties for quantum information applications. First, a high optical density, which can be exploited to produce highly efficient Raman-type quantum memories. Second, due to the close ion spacing, large excitation induced ion-ion frequency shifts similar to those seen in cold atom lattice Rydberg systems. These interactions can lead to quantum many-body states that could be observed using standard optical spectroscopy techniques.

abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been extensively studied in various systems. However, it is not easy to observe in superconducting quantum circuits (SQCs), because the Rabi frequency of the strong controlling field corresponding to EIT is limited by the decay rates of the SQCs. Here, we show that EIT can be achieved by engineering decay rates in a superconducting circuit QED system through a classical driving field on the qubit. Without such a driving field, the superconducting qubit and the cavity field are approximately decoupled in the large detuning regime, and thus the eigenstates of the system are approximately product states of the cavity field and qubit states. However, the driving field can strongly mix these product states and so-called polariton states can be formed. The weights of the states for the qubit and cavity field in the polariton states can be tuned by the driving field, and thus the decay rates of the polariton states can be changed. We choose a three-level system with $\Lambda$-type transitions in such a driven circuit QED system, and demonstrate how EIT and ATS can be realized in this compound system. We believe that this study will be helpful for EIT experiments using SQCs.

abstract: We report on efficient generation of second harmonic laser and single-mode vacuum squeezed light of 795 nm with periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystals. We achieved 111 mW of ultra-violet (UV) light at 397.5 nm from 191 mW of fundamental light with a PPKTP crystal in a doubling cavity, corresponding to a conversion efficiency of 58.1%. Using the UV light to pump an optical parametric oscillator with a PPKTP crystal, we realized -5.6 dB of a maximum squeezing. We analyzed the pump power dependence of the squeezing level and concluded that the UV light induced losses limit the improvement of the squeezing level. The generated squeezed light has huge potential application in quantum memory and ultra-precise measurement.

Using perturbation theory in polaron frame of reference, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that is valid in the regime of strong spin-phonon coupling under non-adiabatic conditions. It is shown that the effective Hamiltonian commutes with the IRHM upto leading orders of perturbation and thus has the same eigenstates as the IRHM. Using a quantum master equation with Markovian approximation of dynamical evolution, we show that the off diagonal elements of the density matrix donot decay in the energy eigen basis of IRHM.

comments: 9 pages
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.05222
abstract: The purpose of the present note is twofold. Firstly, we highlight the similarities between the ontologies of Kastner's possibilist transactional interpretation (PTI) of quantum mechanics - an extension of Cramer's transactional interpretation - and the authors' hidden-measurement interpretation (HMI). Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry breaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of incipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain why the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born rule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a quantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure state to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently derived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI - precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative description of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden measurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of the values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of probabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide the missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However, EBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific notion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical mechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.

abstract: We investigate the influence of the photon statistics on the excitation dynamics of a single two level system. A single semiconductor quantum dot represents the two level system and is resonantly excited either with coherent laser light, or excited with chaotic light, with photon statistics corresponding to that of thermal radiation. Experimentally, we observe a reduced absorption cross-section under chaotic excitation in the steady-state. In the transient regime, the Rabi oscillations observable under coherent excitation disappear under chaotic excitation. Likewise, in the emission spectrum the well-known Mollow triplet, which we observe under coherent drive, disappears under chaotic excitation. Our observations are fully consistent with theoretical predictions based on the semi-classical Bloch equation approach. They represent a landmark in the resonant excitation of the quantum mechanical two level system.

abstract: Two well-known mechanisms, one-axis twisting (OAT) and two-axis countertwisting (TACT), generate spinsqueezed states dynamically. The latter provides better spin squeezing (SS) but has not been demonstrated as the form of its interaction does not occur naturally in known physical systems. Several proposals for realizing effective TACT transformed from OAT require stringent experimental conditions in order to overcome the resulting nonstationary (oscillating) SS and continuously varying mean spin directions. This work presents a simple scheme that solves both problems by freezing SS at an optimal point and realizing effectively persistent SS by inhibiting further squeezing dynamics. Explicit procedures are outlined for persistent SS of the TACT limit. Protocols based on our scheme favorably relax experimental demands, which significantly brighten the prospects for realizing TACT.

abstract: Measuring the thermodynamic properties of open quantum systems poses a major challenge. A calorimetric detection has been proposed as a feasible experimental scheme to measure work and fluctuation relations in open quantum systems. However, the detection requires a finite size for the environment, which influences the system dynamics. This process cannot be modeled with the standard stochastic approaches. We develop a quantum jump model suitable for systems coupled to a finite-size environment. With the method we study the common fluctuation relations and prove that they are satisfied.

abstract: We study the problem of detecting multipartite entanglement among indistinguishable fermionic particles. A multipartite concurrence for pure states of $N$ identical fermions, each one having a $d$-dimensional single-particle Hilbert space, is introduced. Such entanglement measure, in particular, is optimized for maximally entangled states of three identical fermions that play a role analogous to the usual (qubit) GHZ-state. In addition, it is shown that the fermionic multipartite concurrence can be expressed as the mean value of an observable, provided two copies of the composite state are available.

abstract: We examine the problem of finding the minimum number of Pauli measurements needed to uniquely determine an arbitrary $n$-qubit pure state among all quantum states. We show that only $11$ Pauli measurements are needed to determine an arbitrary two-qubit pure state compared to the full quantum state tomography with $16$ measurements, and only $31$ Pauli measurements are needed to determine an arbitrary three-qubit pure state compared to the full quantum state tomography with $64$ measurements. We demonstrate that our protocol is robust under depolarizing error with simulated random pure states. We experimentally test the protocol on two- and three-qubit systems with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. We show that the pure state tomography protocol saves us a number of measurements without considerable loss of fidelity. We compare our protocol with same-size sets of randomly selected Pauli operators and find that our selected set of Pauli measurements significantly outperforms those random sampling sets. As a direct application, our scheme can also be used to reduce the number of settings needed for pure-state tomography in quantum optical systems.

abstract: Various models have been proposed in which the Schr\"odinger equation is modified to account for a decay of spatial coherences of massive objects. While optomechanical systems and matter-wave interferometry with large clusters are promising candidates to test these models, we here show that using available techniques for atoms in optical lattices, some of these models can be efficiently tested. In particular, we compare unconventional decoherence due to quantum gravity as introduced by Ellis and co-workers [Phys. Lett. B ${\bf 221}$, 113 (1989)] and conventional decoherence due to scattering of the lattice photons and conclude that optimal performances are achieved with a few atoms in the realistic case where product atomic states are prepared. A detailed analysis shows that a single atom delocalized on a scale of 10 cm for about a second can be used to test efficiently the hypothetical quantum gravity induced decoherence.

abstract: We investigate spontaneous photon emission and absorption processes of two two-level atoms trapped close to the focal points of an ellipsoidal cavity, thereby taking into account the full multimode scenario. In particular, we calculate the excitation probabilities of the atoms by describing the field modes semiclassically. Based on this approach, we express the excitation probabilities by a semiclassical photon path representation. Due to the special property of an ellipsoidal cavity of having two focal points, we are able to study interesting intermediate instances between well-known quantum-optical scenarios. Furthermore, the semiclassical photon path representation enables us to address the corresponding retardation effects and causality questions in a straightforward manner.

abstract: All natural things process and transform information. They receive environmental information as input, and transform it into appropriate output responses. Much of science is dedicated to building models of such systems -- algorithmic abstractions of their input-output behavior that allow us to simulate how such systems can behave in the future, conditioned on what has transpired in the past. Here, we show that classical models cannot avoid inefficiency -- storing past information that is unnecessary for correct future simulation. We construct quantum models that mitigate this waste, whenever it is physically possible to do so. This suggests that the complexity of general input-output processes depends fundamentally on what sort of information theory we use to describe them.

abstract: Information theory establishes the fundamental limits on data transmission, storage, and processing. Quantum information theory unites information theoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to give a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful possibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and quantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion of different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of entropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding answers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious cases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity region of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a quantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates. Here we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform additivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known quantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly additive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy inequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and intriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive functions are identical; the tractable answers in classical and quantum information theory are formally equivalent. Our techniques pave the way for a deeper understanding of the tractability of information theory, from classical multi-user problems like broadcast channels to the evaluation of quantum channel capacities.

abstract: We study an effect of quenching of antihydrogen quantum states near material surface in the gravitational field of the Earth by local charges randomly distributed along the mirror surface. The quenching mechanism reduces the quantum reflection probability because of additional atom-charge interaction and nonadiabatic transitions to excited gravitational states. Our approach is suitable for accounting for quenching caused by any kind of additional interaction with the characteristic range much smaller than the typical gravitational state wave-length.

abstract: Quantum superpositions of distinct coherent states in a single-mode harmonic oscillator, known as "cat states", have been an elegant demonstration of Schrodinger's famous cat paradox. Here, we realize a two-mode cat state of electromagnetic fields in two microwave cavities bridged by a superconducting artificial atom, which can also be viewed as an entangled pair of single-cavity cat states. We present full quantum state tomography of this complex cat state over a Hilbert space exceeding 100 dimensions via quantum non-demolition measurements of the joint photon number parity. The ability to manipulate such multi-cavity quantum states paves the way for logical operations between redundantly encoded qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computation and communication.

abstract: Single photon detection is a requisite technique in quantum-optics experiments in both the optical and the microwave domains. However, the energy of microwave quanta are four to five orders of magnitude less than their optical counterpart, making the efficient detection of single microwave photons extremely challenging. Here, we demonstrate the detection of a single microwave photon propagating through a waveguide. The detector is implemented with an "impedance-matched" artificial $\Lambda$ system comprising the dressed states of a driven superconducting qubit coupled to a microwave resonator. We attain a single-photon detection efficiency of $0.66 \pm 0.06$ with a reset time of $\sim 400$~ns. This detector can be exploited for various applications in quantum sensing, quantum communication and quantum information processing.

abstract: Divisibility of dynamical maps turns out to be a fundamental notion in characterising Markovianity of quantum evolution, although the decision problem for divisibility itself is computationally intractable. In this work, we propose the operational characterisation of divisibility of dynamical maps by exploiting distinguishability of quantum channels. We prove that distinguishability for any pair of quantum channels does not increase under divisible maps, and then, in terms of channel distinguishability with entanglement between system and $k$-dimensional ancillas, provide the operational characterization for the full hierarchy of the so-called $k$-divisiblity $(k=1,2,\ldots)$. Finally, from the fact that min-entropy corresponds to the information-theoretic measure of distinguishability, the entropic characterisation to divisible maps is also provided.

By addressing systems with temperature inhomogeneities and laser interactions, we show that non-monotonous energetic landscapes can be produced where barriers and minima appear. Our treatment provides a self-consistent quantum theoretical framework for investigating the properties of a class of non-equilibrium atom-surface interactions.

abstract: Adiabatic dynamics plays an essential role in quantum technologies. By driving a quantum system slowly, the quantum evolution can be engineered with suppressed excitation. Yet, environmentally-induced decoherence limits the implementation of adiabatic protocols. Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) have the potential to revolutionize quantum technologies by speeding up the time evolution while mimicking adiabatic dynamics. These nonadiabatic protocols can be engineered by means an auxiliary control field is used to tailor excitations. Here we present the first experimental realization of counterdiabatic driving in a continuous variable system, implementing a shortcut to the adiabatic transport of a trapped ion, in which nonadiabatic transitions are suppressed during all stages of the process. The resulting dynamics is equivalent to a "fast-motion video" of the adiabatic trajectory. We experimentally demonstrate the enhanced robustness of the protocol with respect to alternative approaches based on classical local controls including Fourier optimization schemes. Our results demonstrate that STA protocols provide a robust speedup on demand, paving the way to their application in a wide variety of quantum technologies.

abstract: Bosonic channels are important in practice as they form a simple model for free-space or fiber-optic communication. Here we consider a single-sender two-receiver pure-loss bosonic broadcast channel and determine the unconstrained capacity region for the distillation of bipartite entanglement and secret key between the sender and each receiver, whenever they are allowed arbitrary public classical communication. We show how the state merging protocol leads to achievable rates in this setting, giving an inner bound on the capacity region. We also evaluate an outer bound on the region by using the relative entropy of entanglement and a `reduction by teleportation' technique. The outer bounds match the inner bounds in the infinite-energy limit, thereby establishing the unconstrained capacity region for such channels. Our result could provide a useful benchmark for implementing a broadcasting of entanglement and secret key through such channels. An important open question relevant to practice is to determine the capacity region in both this setting and the single-sender single-receiver case when there is an energy constraint on the transmitter.

abstract: A general framework of quantum state ampli?cation using the language of quantum state transformation is given systematically for the ?rst time. The concept of ampli?cation of quantum states is de?ned speci?cally and the ampli?cation of a set of quantum states is formulated generally as the transformation of quantum states. Three di?erent kinds of important quantum ampli?cations, i.e., deterministic noisy quantum ampli?cation, probabilistic noiseless quantum ampli?cation, and deterministic noiseless quantum ampli?cation are identi?ed and discussed. For deterministic quan- tum ampli?cation, the linearity of ampli?cation is proven to be incompatible with the noiseless ampli?cation while it is not true for probabilistic quantum ampli?cation. However, deterministic noiseless quantum ampli?cation is shown physically attainable if the linearity of ampli?cation is given up. The connection between the gain of ampli?cation and the successful probability is discussed for probabilistic quantum ampli?cation. Assuming that successful probability is the same for all quantum states to be ampli?ed, we obtain a generally valid relation between the gain of amplication and the successful probability. Particular interest is given to phase-preserving quantum amplication of Gaussian states which has been shown of theoretical interest and of practical importance in quantum information and quantum communication recently. Our results of quantum state ampli?cation not only enrich the research of quantum ampli?cation but also can be helpful for further practical applications.

abstract: Networks constitute efficient tools for assessing universal features of complex systems. In physical contexts, classical as well as quantum, networks are used to describe a wide range of phenomena, such as phase transitions, intricate aspects of many-body quantum systems or even characteristic features of a future quantum internet. Random quantum networks and their associated directed graphs are employed for capturing statistically dominant features of complex quantum systems. Here, we develop an efficient iterative method capable of evaluating the probability of a graph being strongly connected. It is proven that random directed graphs with constant edge-establishing probability are typically strongly connected, i.e. any ordered pair of vertices is connected by a directed path. This typical topological property of directed random graphs is exploited to demonstrate universal features of the asymptotic evolution of large random qubit networks. These results are independent of our knowledge of the details of the network topology. These findings suggest that also other highly complex networks, such as a future quantum internet, may exhibit similar universal properties.

abstract: A change in the sign of the frequency of a wave between two inertial reference frames corresponds to a reversal of the phase velocity. Yet from the point of view of the relation $E=\hbar\omega$, a positive quantum of energy apparently becomes a negative energy one. This is physically distinct from a change in the sign of the wave-vector, and has been associated with various effects such as Cherenkov radiation, quantum friction, and the Hawking effect. In this work we provide a more detailed understanding of these negative frequency modes based on a simple microscopic model of a dielectric medium as a lattice of scatterers. We calculate the classical and quantum mechanical radiation damping of an oscillator moving through such a lattice and find that the modes where the frequency has changed sign contribute negatively. In terms of the lattice of scatterers we find that this negative radiation damping arises due to phase of the periodic force experienced by the oscillator due to the relative motion of the lattice.

abstract: We examine the fluctuation theorems which traditionally have been studied for classical systems and enquire if they can be extended to the quantum domain, especially at low temperatures. The example chosen is that of a problem which has proven to be of great interest in the context of Landau diamagnetism viz. the quantized motion of an electron in a magnetic field and in a dissipative environment. It is established from first principles that the quantum work operator W has a Gaussian distribution even though the system under consideration has a four dimensional phase space. The parameter $\alpha$ in the fluctuation theorem $p(W )/p(-W) = exp(\alpha W)$ depends on the system dynamics and has characteristic quantum features, especially at low temperatures. Certain unique low temperature signatures are also discussed.

abstract: Over the past decade donor spin qubits in isotopically enriched $^{28}$Si have been intensely studied due to their exceptionally long coherence times. More recently bismuth donor electron spins have become popular because Bi has a large nuclear spin which gives rise to clock transitions (first-order insensitive to magnetic field noise). At every clock transition there are two nearly degenerate transitions between four distinct states which can be used as a pair of qubits. Here it is experimentally demonstrated that these transitions are excited by microwaves of opposite helicity such that they can be selectively driven by varying microwave polarization. This work uses a combination of a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) microresonator and a dielectric resonator to flexibly generate arbitrary elliptical polarizations while retaining the high sensitivity of the CPW.

abstract: Interference is central to quantum physics and occurs when indistinguishable paths exist, like in a double-slit experiment. Replacing the two slits with two single atoms introduces optical non-linearities for which nontrivial interference phenomena are predicted. Their observation, however, has been hampered by difficulties in preparing the required atomic distribution, controlling the optical phases and detecting the faint light. Here we overcome all of these experimental challenges by combining an optical lattice for atom localisation, an imaging system with single-site resolution, and an optical resonator for light steering. We observe resonator-induced saturation of resonance fluorescence for constructive interference of the scattered light and nonzero emission with huge photon bunching for destructive interference. The latter is explained by atomic saturation and photon pair generation. Our experimental setting is scalable and allows one to realize the Tavis-Cummings model for any number of atoms and photons, explore fundamental aspects of light-matter interaction, and implement new quantum information processing protocols.

abstract: We discuss a method to adapt the codeword stabilized (CWS) quantum code framework to the problem of finding asymmetric quantum codes. We focus on the corresponding Pauli error models for amplitude damping noise and phase damping noise. In particular, we look at codes for Pauli error models that correct one or two amplitude damping errors. Applying local Clifford operations on graph states, we are able to exhaustively search for all possible codes up to length $9$. With a similar method, we also look at codes for the Pauli error model that detect a single amplitude error and detect multiple phase damping errors. Many new codes with good parameters are found, including nonadditive codes and degenerate codes.

abstract: The traditional second law of thermodynamics says that the average amount of work required to change one state into another while in contact with a heat reservoir, must be at least as large as the change in free energy of the system. Here, we consider a fine-grained notion of the free energy, and show that in terms of it, the second law can be written as an equality. We also obtain a generalisation of the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem which holds for arbitrary initial states, not just the case of an initial thermal state. We derive a generalisation of Gibbs-stochasticity, a condition originally found in the approach to thermodynamics inspired by quantum information theory. This generalisation directly incorporates the case of fluctuating work and serves as a parent equation which can be used to derive the second law equality and the generalisation of the Jarzynski equation. We further show that each of these three generalisations can be seen as the quasi-classical limit of three fully quantum identities. This allows for more general and fully quantum fluctuation relations from the information theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: Quantum correlations between two systems can be impaired by the presence of an environment, as it can make systems decohere. We wish to evaluate how much coherence has been irreversibly lost. To do so, we study two qubits which leak correlations into an arbitrarily large environment and we find that our ability to steer one of them to the most coherent set of states possible by acting on the other is given by the sub-fidelity of two conditional states of the environment. Sub-fidelity is a quantity that was already known, but that until now lacked an operational interpretation. Furthermore, we conjecture the existence of a family of measures, of which fidelity and sub-fidelity are the first two, which measure the irreversibility of decoherence as we gain access to more and more degrees of freedom of the enviroment.

abstract: Although some non-trivial photon number resolving detectors exist, it may still be convenient to discriminate photon number states with the method of multiplexed detection. Multiplexing can be performed with paths in real space, with paths in time, and in principle with any degree of freedom that has a sufficient number of eigenstates and that can be coupled to the photon number. Previous works have addressed the probabilities involved in these measurements with Monte Carlo simulations, or by restricting the number of detectors to powers of 2, or without including quantum efficiency or noise. In this work we find an analytical expression of the detection probabilities for any number of input photons and any number of on/off photon detectors with a quantum efficiency $0\%\leq\eta\leq100\%$ and a false count probability $\varepsilon\geq0$. This allows us to retrodict the number of photons that we had at the input in the least unbiased way possible. We conclude our work with some examples.

abstract: We consider the problem of estimating multiple phases using a multi-mode interferometer. In this setting we show that while global strategies with multi-mode entanglement can lead to high precision gains, the same precision enhancements can be obtained with mode-separable states and local measurements. The crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to be a large number variance in the probe state, which can be obtained without any entanglement between the modes. This has important practical implications because local strategies using separable states have many advantages over global schemes using multi-mode-entangled states. Such advantages include a robustness to local estimation failure, more flexibility in the distribution of resources, and comparatively easier state preparation. We obtain our results by analyzing two different schemes: the first uses a set of interferometers, which can be used as a model for a network of quantum sensors, and the second looks at measuring a number of phases relative to a reference, which is concerned primarily with quantum imaging.

abstract: Pulse propagation is studied in an EIT medium with the control field having a periodically varying phase (chirp). Based both on numerical calculations and on an approximate approach neglecting absorption and nonadiabatic effects, it is shown that transparency occurs for probe pulses having a sufficiently narrow envelope and an appropriately suited chirp. For other chirped pulses the evolution of their spectra along a sample is studied. Using a projection method one can divide a pulse into a part for which the medium is transparent and a rest for which it is opaque.

abstract: The sensitivity of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) depends strongly on nuclear spin polarisation and, motivated by this observation, dynamical nuclear spin polarisation has recently been applied to enhance MRI protocols (Kurhanewicz, J., et al., Neoplasia 13, 81 (2011)). Nuclear spins associated with the 13 C carbon isotope (nuclear spin I = 1/2) in diamond possess uniquely long spin lattice relaxation times (Reynhardt, E.C. and G.L. High, Prog. in Nuc. Mag. Res. Sp. 38, 37 (2011)) If they are present in diamond nanocrystals, especially when strongly polarised, they form a promising contrast agent for MRI. Current schemes for achieving nuclear polarisation, however, require cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate an efficient scheme that realises optically induced 13 C nuclear spin hyperpolarisation in diamond at room temperature and low ambient magnetic field. Optical pumping of a Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centre creates a continuously renewable electron spin polarisation which can be transferred to surrounding 13 C nuclear spins. Importantly for future applications we also realise polarisation protocols that are robust againstan unknown misalignment between magnetic field and crystal axis.

abstract: Logic-qubit entanglement is a promising resource in quantum information processing, especially in future large-scale quantum networks. In the paper, we put forward an efficient entanglement purification protocol (EPP) for nonlocal mixed logic entangled states with the bit-flip error in the logic qubits of the logic Bell state, resorting to the photon-atom interaction in low-quality (Q) cavity and atomic state measurement. Different from existing EPPs, this protocol can also purify the logic phase-flip error, and the bit-flip error and the phase-flip error in physic qubit. During the protocol, we only require to measure the atom states, and it is useful for improving the entanglement of photon systems in future large-scale quantum networks.

Our proposal might pave the way for multipurpose parity protected quantum information tasks, and for the enhancement of excitations transfer in disordered systems.

abstract: Accurately controlling a quantum system is a fundamental requirement in many areas of modern science ranging from quantum information processing to high-precision measurements. The ultimate goal in quantum control is to prepare a desired state as fast as possible with sufficient high-fidelity allowed by available resources and the experimental constraints. Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a robust way for high-fidelity state transfer with the requirement of sufficiently long operation time for the adiabatic evolution. We here theoretically propose and then experimentally demonstrate a transitionless superadiabatic protocol to speed up the STIRAP. Through simply modifying the shapes of the Raman pulses, a fast and high-fidelity Stimulated Raman superadiabatic passage is experimentally realized, which is robust against control parameter variations. The all-optical, robust, and fast protocol demonstrated here provides an efficient and practical way to control the quantum systems.

abstract: In the last years the possibility of creating and manipulating quantum states of light has paved the way to the development of new technologies exploiting peculiar properties of quantum states, as quantum information, quantum metrology & sensing, quantum imaging ... In particular Quantum Imaging addresses the possibility of overcoming limits of classical optics by using quantum resources as entanglement or sub-poissonian statistics. Albeit quantum imaging is a more recent field than other quantum technologies, e.g. quantum information, it is now substantially mature for application. Several different protocols have been proposed, some of them only theoretically, others with an experimental implementation and a few of them pointing to a clear application. Here we present a few of the most mature protocols ranging from ghost imaging to sub shot noise imaging and sub Rayleigh imaging.

abstract: Quantum weak measurement, measuring some observable quantities within the selected sub-ensemble of the entire quantum ensemble, can produce many interesting results such as the superluminal phenomena. An outcome of such a measurement is the weak value which has been applied to amplify some weak signals of quantum interactions in lots of previous references. Here, we apply the weak measurement to the system of relativistic cold atoms. According to Einstein equivalence principle, the internal energy of an atom will contribute its rest-mass and consequently the external momentum of center-of-mass. This implies a weak "spin"-orbit coupling of atom in the free space. After a duration of this coupling, a weak value can be obtained by post-selecting an internal state of atoms. We show that, such a weak value can significantly change the atoms diffraction in the future times and consequently could help us to experimentally measure the weak effects of special relativity.

abstract: Conventionally, unknown quantum states are characterized using quantum-state tomography based on strong or weak measurements carried out on an ensemble of identically prepared systems. By contrast, the use of protective measurements offers the possibility of determining quantum states from a series of weak, long measurements performed on a single system. Because the fidelity of a protectively measured quantum state is determined by the amount of state disturbance incurred during each protective measurement, it is crucial that the initial quantum state of the system is disturbed as little as possible. Here we show how to systematically minimize the state disturbance in the course of a protective measurement, thus enabling the maximization of the fidelity of the quantum-state measurement. Our approach is based on a careful tuning of the time dependence of the measurement interaction and is shown to be dramatically more effective in reducing the state disturbance than the previously considered strategy of weakening the measurement strength and increasing the measurement time. We describe a method for designing the measurement interaction such that the state disturbance exhibits polynomial decay to arbitrary order in the inverse measurement time $1/T$. We also show how one can achieve even faster, subexponential decay, and we find that it represents the smallest possible state disturbance in a protective measurement. In this way, our results show how to optimally measure the state of a single quantum system using protective measurements.

abstract: In a delayed-choice quantum eraser, interference fringes are obtained by erasing which-way information after the interfering particle has already been irreversibly detected. Following an introductory review of delayed-choice experiments and quantum erasure, we describe the experimental realization of an optical delayed-choice quantum eraser, suitable for advanced undergraduates, based on polarization-entangled pairs of single photons. In our experiment, the delay of the erasure is implemented using two different setups. The first setup employs an arrangement of mirrors to increase the optical path length of the photons carrying which-way information. In the second setup, we use fiber-optic cables to elongate the path of these photons after their passage through the polarization analyzer but prior to their arrival at the detector. We compare our results to data obtained in the absence of a delay and find excellent agreement. This shows that the timing of the erasure is irrelevant, as also predicted by quantum mechanics. The experiment can serve as a valuable pedagogical tool for conveying the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

In the limit of a perfect mirror, our formulas recover those found in the literature for the Robin boundary condition.

abstract: Randomness is an indispensable resource in modern science and information technology. Fortunately, an experimentally simple procedure exists to generate randomness with well-characterized devices: measuring a quantum system in a basis complementary to its preparation. Towards realizing this goal one may consider using atoms or superconducting qubits, promising candidates for quantum information processing. However, their unavoidable interaction with the electromagnetic field affects their dynamics. At large time scales, this can result in decoherence. Smaller time scales in principle avoid this problem, but may not be well analysed under the usual rotating wave and single-mode approximation (RWA and SMA) which break the relativistic nature of quantum field theory. Here, we use a fully relativistic analysis to quantify the information that an adversary with access to the field could get on the result of an atomic measurement. Surprisingly, we find that the adversary's guessing probability is not minimized for atoms initially prepared in the ground state (an intuition derived from the RWA and SMA model).

abstract: We report 100% duty cycle generation of sub-MHz single photon pairs at the Rubidium D$_1$ line using cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric downconversion. The temporal intensity crosscorrelation function exhibits a bandwidth of $666 \pm 16$ kHz for the single photons, an order of magnitude below the natural linewidth of the target transition. A half-wave plate inside our cavity helps to achieve triple resonance between pump, signal and idler photon, reducing the bandwidth and simplifying the locking scheme. Additionally, stabilisation of the cavity to the pump frequency enables the 100% duty cycle. These photons are well-suited for storage in quantum memory schemes with sub-natural linewidths, such as gradient echo memories.

We introduce a mapping of the Hilbert space that allows to chart usefully the accessible regions. We then consider the quantum excitation from single photon sources in the form of a two-level system under various regimes of (classical) pumping: incoherent, coherent and in the Mollow triplet regime. We close this first opus with an overview of the material to be covered in the subsequent papers.

abstract: We demonstrate cooling of ultrathin fiber tapers coupled with nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds to cryogenic temperatures. Nanodiamonds containing multiple NV centers are deposited on the subwavelength 480-nm-diameter nanofiber region of fiber tapers. The fiber tapers are successfully cooled to 9 K using our home-built mounting holder and an optimized cooling speed. The fluorescence from the nanodiamond NV centers is efficiently channeled into a single guided mode and shows characteristic sharp zero-phonon lines of both neutral and negatively charged NV centers. The present nanofiber/nanodiamond hybrid systems at cryogenic temperatures can be used as NV-based quantum information devices and for highly sensitive nanoscale magnetometry in a cryogenic environment.

abstract: Given a set of multipartite entangled states, can we find a common state to prepare them by local operations and classical communication? Such a state, if exists, will be a common resource for the given set of states. We completely solve this problem for bipartite pure states case by explicitly constructing a unique optimal common resource state for any given set of states. In the multipartite setting, the general problem becomes quite complicated, and we focus on finding nontrivial common resources for the whole multipartite state space of given dimensions. We show that GHZ_3 is a nontrivial common resource for three-qubit systems.

We also propose an upper bound on the maximum correct probability with a fixed rate of inconclusive results. The performance of the proposed bounds are evaluated through numerical experiments.

abstract: Topologically ordered phase has emerged as one of most exciting concepts that not only broadens our understanding of phases of matter, but also has been found to have potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The direct measurement of topological properties, however, is still a challenge especially in interacting quantum system. Here we realize one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chains using nuclear magnetic resonance simulators and observe the interaction-induced topological transitions, where Berry curvature in the parameter space of Hamiltonian is probed by means of dynamical response and then the first Chern number is extracted by integrating the curvature over the closed surface. The utilized experimental method provides a powerful means to explore topological phenomena in quantum systems with many-body interactions.

abstract: In quantum information process, a single quantum particle can have various degrees of freedom and with coherent coupling among them. To control multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously is necessary to describe the particle fully and, therefore, to use it more efficiently. As for photons, polarization, frequency, time, orbital angular momentum, and even transverse mode have been used in free-space and fiber quantum systems. Compared with free space and fiber optics, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their small footprints, scalability, reduced power consumption, and enhanced processing stability, thus many quantum computation and quantum simulation protocols have been realized on quantum PICs (QPICs). It should be noted that, usually only one degree of freedom, for example, path or polarization, was used in those works. Here we demonstrate the coherent conversion of photonic quantum signals between different degrees of freedom on a single chip. By using mode multiplexers and mode converters, single photons in different optical paths or different polarizations can be converted to/back to different transverse waveguide modes in a single multi-mode waveguide, while the latter is an ideal platform for higher dimensional quantum information process. The preservation of quantum coherence in these conversion processes are proved by quantum interference using a fiber beam-splitter (BS) or a on-chip BS. These results provided us the ability to control and convert multiple degrees of freedom of photons for QPIC-based quantum information process.

abstract: In recent years, several measures have been proposed for characterizing the coherence of a given quantum state. We derive several results that illuminate how these measures behave when restricted to pure states. Notably, we present an explicit characterization of the closest incoherent state to a given pure state under the trace distance measure of coherence, and we affirm a recent conjecture that the $\ell_1$ measure of coherence of a pure state is never smaller than its relative entropy of coherence. We then use our result to show that the states maximizing the trace distance of coherence are exactly the maximally coherent states, and we derive a new inequality relating the negativity and distillable entanglement of pure states.

abstract: Superdense coding promises increased classical capacity and communication security but this advantage may be undermined by noise in the quantum channel. We present a numerical study of how forward error correction (FEC) applied to the encoded classical message can be used to mitigate against quantum channel noise. By studying the bit error rate under different FEC codes, we identify the unique role that burst errors play in superdense coding, and we show how these can be mitigated against by interleaving the FEC codewords prior to transmission. We conclude that classical FEC with interleaving is a useful method to improve the performance in near-term demonstrations of superdense coding.

abstract: Uncertainty relations describe the lower bound of product of standard deviations of observables. By revealing a connection between standard deviations of quantum observables and numerical radius of operators, we establish a universal uncertainty relation for any $k$ observables, of which the formulation depends on the even or odd quality of $k$. This universal uncertainty relation is tight at least for the cases $k=2n$ and $k=3$. For two observables, the uncertainty relation is exactly a simpler reformulation of Schr\"odinger's uncertainty principle.

abstract: We consider a problem of description of quantum correlations and dispersions of subsystems of complex open systems. Based on our previous results we proposed a method to evaluate pure quantum contributions from total statistical characteristics of two coupled oscillators interacting with thermal reservoirs. The natural way to extract pure quantum characteristic of the system under study is a calculation of difference between the total value and its pure classical part. A numerical study of temporal behavior of quantum variances and covariances from given initial states up to states in the infinite time limit is given using the proposed method. It is shown that at comparatively high temperatures the steady state total variances are almost classical, because their pure quantum parts tend to zero in this regime. Otherwise, at comparatively low temperatures, the pure quantum parts of variances are not zeroing in steady states manifesting a finite contribution to total values. The same is true for the covariance. The larger the temperature, the lower is the quantum contribution to the total covariance. As well as entanglement measures, quantum discord, the pure quantum contributions in the covariance matrix elements are important characteristics of the temporal dynamics of complex quantum systems.

abstract: For a pair of quantum channels with the same input space, we show that the possibility of approximation of one channel by post-processings of the other channel can be characterized by comparing the success probabilities for the two ensembles obtained as outputs for any ensemble on the input space coupled with an ancilla. This provides an operational interpretation to a natural extension of Le Cam's deficiency to quantum channels. In particular, we obtain a version of the randomization criterion for quantum statistical experiments. The proofs are based on some properties of the diamond norm and its dual, which are of independent interest.

abstract: Round-robin differential-phase-shift quantum key distribution (RRDPS QKD) has been proposed to raise the noise tolerability of the channel. However, in practice, the measurement device in RRDPS QKD may be imperfect. Here, we show that, with these imperfections, the security of RRDPS may be damaged, by proposing two attacks for RRDPS systems with uncharacterized measurement devices. One is valid even for a system with unit total efficiency, while the other is valid even when a single photon state is sent. To prevent these attacks, either security arguments need to be fundamentally revised or further practical assumptions on the measurement device should be put.

abstract: We introduce a stability criterion for quantum statistical ensembles describing macroscopic systems. An ensemble is called "stable" when a small number of local measurements cannot significantly modify the probability distribution of the total energy of the system. We apply this criterion to lattices of spins-1/2, thereby showing that the canonical ensemble is nearly stable, whereas statistical ensembles with much broader energy distributions are not stable. In the context of the foundations of quantum statistical physics, this result justifies the use of statistical ensembles with narrow energy distributions such as canonical or microcanonical ensembles.

abstract: Quantum particle simulations have largely been based on time-independent, split-operator schemes in which kinetic and potential operators are interwoven to provide accurate approximations to system dynamics. These simulations can be very expensive in terms of the number of gates required, although individual cases, such as tunneling, have been found where prethreshold simulations are possible. By prethreshold, we mean a quantum computation or simulation with an existing architecture and not requiring error correction. In the case of molecular collisions, switching to a time-dependent formulation can reduce the system dimensionality significantly and provide an opportunity for pre-threshold simulation. Here, we study the efficiency of gate-based quantum simulation of a set of molecular collisions of increasing complexity. We show that prethreshold quantum simulation of such systems is feasible up to Hilbert space dimension 8, but beyond that error correction would be required.

abstract: The problem of device-independent randomness amplification against no-signaling adversaries has so far been studied under the assumption that the weak source of randomness is uncorrelated with the (quantum) devices used in the amplification procedure. In this work, we relax this assumption, and reconsider the original protocol of Colbeck and Renner, Nature Physics 8, 450-454 (2012), on randomness amplification using a Santha-Vazirani (SV) source. To do so, we introduce an SV-like condition for devices, namely that any string of SV source bits remains weakly random conditioned upon any other bit string from the same SV source and the outputs obtained when this further string is input into the devices. Assuming this condition, we show that a quantum device using a singlet state to violate the chained Bell inequalities leads to full randomness in the asymptotic scenario of a large number of settings, for a restricted set of SV sources (with $0 \leq \varepsilon < \frac{(2^{(1/12)} - 1)}{2(2^{(1/12)} + 1)} \approx 0.0144$). We also study a device-independent protocol that allows for correlations between the sequence of boxes used in the protocol and the SV source bits used to choose the particular box from whose output the randomness is obtained. Assuming the SV-like condition for devices, we show that the honest parties can achieve amplification of the weak source against this attack for the parameter range $0 \leq \varepsilon<0.0132$. We leave the case of a yet more general attack on the amplification protocol as an interesting open problem.

abstract: We develop an intuitive model of 2D microwave near-fields in the unusual regime of centimeter waves localized to tens of microns. Close to an intensity minimum, a simple effective description emerges with five parameters which characterize the strength and spatial orientation of the zero and first order terms of the near-field, as well as the field polarization. Such a field configuration is realized in a microfabricated planar structure with an integrated microwave conductor operating near 1 GHz. We use a single 9Be+ ion as a high-resolution quantum sensor to measure the field distribution through energy shifts in its hyperfine structure. We find agreement with simulations at the sub-micron and few-degree level. Our findings give a clear and general picture of the basic properties of oscillatory 2D near-fields with applications in quantum information processing, neutral atom trapping and manipulation, chip-scale atomic clocks, and integrated microwave circuits.

abstract: The quantum and classical behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) alternative quantum walk (AQW) in the presence of decoherence have been discussed in detail. For any kinds of decoherence, the analytic expressions for the moments of position distribution of AQW have been obtained. Taking the broken line noise and coin-decoherence as examples of decoherence, we find that when the decoherence only emerges in one direction, the anisotropic position distribution pattern appears, and not all the motions of quantum walkers exhibit the transition from quantum to classical behaviors. The correlations between the walkers and the coin in 2D AQW have been discussed. The anisotropic correlations between walkers and coin have been revealed in the presence of decoherence.

abstract: Although the topological order is known as a quantum order in quantum many-body systems, it seems that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between topological phases and quantum phases. As a well-known example, it has been shown that all one-dimensional (1D) quantum phases are topologically trivial\cite{spt}. By such a fact, it seems a challenging task to understand when a quantum phase transition between different topological models necessarily reveals different topological classes of them. In this paper, we make an attempt to consider this problem by studying a phase transition between two different quantum phases which belong to a universal topological phase. We define a Hamiltonian which describes an interpolation between the toric code model with $Z_2$ topological order and the color code model with $Z_2 \times Z_2$ topological order on a hexagonal lattice. We show such a model is exactly mapped to many copies of 1D quantum Ising model in transverse field by rewriting the Hamiltonian in a new complete basis. Consequently, we show that the universal topological phase of the color code model and the toric code model reflects in the 1D nature of the phase transition. We also consider the expectation value of Wilson loops by a perturbative calculation and show that behavior of the Wilson loop captures the non-topological nature of the quantum phase transition. The result on the point of phase transition also show that the color code model is strongly robust against the toric code model.

abstract: Computation models such as circuits describe sequences of computation steps that are carried out one after the other. In other words, algorithm design is traditionally subject to the restriction imposed by a fixed causal order. We address a novel computing paradigm, replacing this assumption by mere logical consistency: We study non-causal circuits, where a fixed time structure within a gate is locally assumed whilst the global causal structure between the gates is dropped. We present examples of logically consistent non-causal circuits outperforming all causal ones; they imply that suppressing loops entirely is more restrictive than just avoiding the contradictions they can give rise to. That fact is already known for correlations as well as for communication, and we here extend it to computation.

We refer to this apparatus as the "asymmetric Talbot-Lau setup". Particular attention is given to its capabilities as an inertial sensor for particle and atomic beams, also in comparison with the classical moir\'e deflectometer. The present analysis is motivated by possible experimental applications in the context of antimatter wave interferometry, including the measurement of the gravitational acceleration of antimatter particles. To support our findings, we have performed numerical simulations of realistic particle beams with varying speed distributions.

abstract: Quantum systems with positions and momenta in Z(d), are described by the d zeros of analytic functions on a torus. The d paths of these zeros on the torus, describe the time evolution of the system. A semi-analytic method for the calculation of these paths of the zeros, is discussed. Detailed analysis of the paths for periodic systems, is presented. A periodic system which has the displacement operator to a real power t, as time evolution operator, is studied. Several numerical examples, which elucidate these ideas, are presented.

abstract: Quantum metamaterials generalize the concept of metamaterials (artificial optical media) to the case when their optical properties are determined by the interplay of quantum effects in the constituent 'artificial atoms' with the electromagnetic field modes in the system. The theoretical investigation of these structures demonstrated that a number of new effects (such as quantum birefringence, strongly nonclassical states of light, etc) are to be expected, prompting the efforts on their fabrication and experimental investigation. Here we provide a summary of the principal features of quantum metamaterials and review the current state of research in this quickly developing field, which bridges quantum optics, quantum condensed matter theory and quantum information processing.

abstract: In the vein of the recent "pretty strong" converse for the quantum and private capacity of degradable quantum channels [Morgan/Winter, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 60(1):317-333, 2014], we use the same techniques, in particular the calculus of min-entropies, to show a pretty strong converse for the private capacity of degraded classical-quantum-quantum (cqq-)wiretap channels, which generalize Wyner's model of the degraded classical wiretap channel. While the result is not completely tight, leaving some gap between the region of error and privacy parameters for which the converse bound holds, and a larger no-go region, it represents a further step towards an understanding of strong converses of wiretap channels [cf. Hayashi/Tyagi/Watanabe, arXiv:1410.0443 for the classical case].

abstract: The recently developed framework for quantum theory with no global causal order allows for quantum processes in which operations in local laboratories are neither causally ordered nor in a probabilistic mixture of definite causal orders. The causal relation between the laboratories is described by the process matrix. We show that, if the inputs of the laboratories are measured in a fixed basis, one can introduce an effective process matrix which is operationally indistinguishable from the original one. This effective process matrix can be obtained by applying the von Neumann- Lu\"ders update rule for nonselective measurements to the original process matrix and in the bipartite case it is compatible with a definite causal order. The latter extends the original Oreshkov et al. proof where one considers that both the measurement of the input and the re-preparation of the output are performed in a fixed basis.

abstract: Frequent observation of a quantum system leads to quantum Zeno physics, where the system evolution is constrained to states commensurate with the measurement outcome. We show that, more generally, the system can evolve between such states through higher-order virtual processes that pass through states outside the measurement subspace. We derive effective Hamiltonians to describe this evolution, and the dependence on the time between measurements. We demonstrate application of this phenomena to prototypical quantum many-body system examples, spin chains and atoms in optical lattices, where it facilitates correlated dynamical effects.

abstract: Displacement of propagating quantum states of light is a fundamental operation for quantum communication. It enables fundamental studies on macroscopic quantum coherence and plays an important role in quantum teleportation protocols with continuous variables. In our experiments we have successfully implemented this operation for propagating squeezed microwave states. We demonstrate that, even for strong displacement amplitudes, there is no degradation of the squeezing level in the reconstructed quantum states. Furthermore, we confirm that path entanglement generated by using displaced squeezed states stays constant over a wide range of the displacement power.

abstract: A discrete parity $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of a two parameter extension of the quantum Rabi model which smoothly interpolates between the latter and the Jaynes-Cummings model, and of the two-photon and the two-mode quantum Rabi models enables their diagonalization in the spin subspace. A more general statement is that the respective sets of $2\times 2$ hermitian operators of the Fulton-Gouterman type and those diagonal in the spin subspace are unitary equivalent. The diagonalized representation makes it transparent that any question about integrability and solvability can be addressed only at the level of ordinary differential operators of Dunkl type. Braak's definition of integrability is shown (i) to contradict earlier numerical studies and (ii) to imply that any physically reasonable differential operator of Dunkl type is integrable.

abstract: We analyze a general family of position-dependent mass quantum Hamiltonians which are not self-adjoint and include, as particular cases, some Hamiltonians obtained in phenomenological approaches to condensed matter physics. We build a general family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians which are quantum mechanically equivalent to the non self-adjoint proposed ones. Inspired in the probability density of the problem, we construct an ansatz for the solutions of the family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians. We use this ansatz to map the solutions of the time independent Schrodinger equations generated by the non self-adjoint Hamiltonians into the Hilbert space of the solutions of the respective dual self-adjoint Hamiltonians. This mapping depends on both the position-dependent mass and on a function of position satisfying a condition that assures the existence of a consistent continuity equation. We identify the non self-adjoint Hamiltonians here studied to a very general family of Hamiltonians proposed in a seminal article of Harrison [1] to describe varying band structures in different types of metals. Therefore, we have self-adjoint Hamiltonians that correspond to the non self-adjoint ones found in Harrison's article. We analyze three typical cases by choosing a physical position-dependent mass and a deformed harmonic oscillator potential . We completely solve the Schrodinger equations for the three cases; we also find and compare their respective energy levels.

abstract: The goal of two-party cryptography is to enable two parties, Alice and Bob, to solve common tasks without the need for mutual trust. Examples of such tasks are private access to a database, and secure identification. Quantum communication enables security for all of these problems in the noisy-storage model by sending more signals than the adversary can store in a certain time frame. Here, we initiate the study of device-independent protocols for two-party cryptography in the noisy-storage model. Specifically, we present a relatively easy to implement protocol for a cryptographic building block known as weak string erasure and prove its security even if the devices used in the protocol are prepared by the dishonest party. Device-independent two-party cryptography is made challenging by the fact that Alice and Bob do not trust each other, which requires new techniques to establish security. We fully analyse the case of memoryless devices (for which sequential attacks are optimal) and the case of sequential attacks for arbitrary devices. The key ingredient of the proof, which might be of independent interest, is an explicit (and tight) relation between the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality observed by Alice and Bob and uncertainty generated by Alice against Bob who is forced to measure his system before finding out Alice's setting (guessing with postmeasurement information). In particular, we show that security is possible for arbitrarily small violation.

abstract: In the recent experimental and theoretical literature well-established nonclassicality criteria from the field of quantum optics have been directly applied to the case of excitations in matter-waves. Among these are violations of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities, Glauber-Sudarshan P-nonclassicality, sub-Poissonian number-difference squeezing (also known as the two-mode variance) and the criterion of nonseparability. We review the strong connection of these criteria and their meaning in quantum optics, and point out differences in the interpretation between light and matter waves. We then calculate observables for a homogenous Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing an arbitrary modulation in the interaction parameter at finite initial temperature, within both the quantum theory as well as a classical reference. We conclude that to date in experiments relevant for analogue gravity, nonclassical effects have not conclusively been observed and conjecture that additional, noncommuting, observables have to be measured to this end.

abstract: The relation between the theory of entanglement and thermodynamics is very tight: a thermodynamic theory of quantum entanglement, as well as the establishment of rigorous formal connections between the laws of thermodynamics and the phenomenology of entanglement are currently open areas of investigation. In this quest, an interesting problem is embodied by the role played by entanglement in processes of work extraction from a working medium embodied by quantum information carriers. In this work, we experimentally address the question "Is there any intrinsic advantage for work extraction given by the use of an entangled working medium?". By addressing work-extraction protocols based on a mechanism intimately linked to the paradigm of Maxwell's daemon, and implementing suitably designed multi-photon optical interferometers, we demonstrate experimentally the intrinsic advantages for such tasks provided by bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement. We highlight the unique nature of such tests by comparing their performance to standard tests for the inseparability of multi-photon state resources. Our work contributes strongly to the ongoing efforts in establishing photonic systems as a platform for experiments for information thermodynamics.

abstract: Recently, the fundamental limits of covert, i.e., reliable-yet-undetectable, communication have been established for general memoryless channels and for lossy-noisy bosonic (quantum) channels with a quantum-limited adversary. The key import of these results was the square-root law (SRL) for covert communication, which states that $O(\sqrt{n})$ covert bits, but no more, can be reliably transmitted over $n$ channel uses with $O(\sqrt{n})$ bits of secret pre-shared between communicating parties. Here we prove the achievability of the SRL for a general memoryless classical-quantum channel, showing that SRL covert communication is achievable over any quantum communication channel with a product-state transmission strategy. We leave open the converse, which, if proven, would show that even using entangled transmissions and entangling measurements, the SRL for covert communication cannot be surpassed over an arbitrary quantum channel.

abstract: In recent years, material-induced noise arising from defects has emerged as an impediment to quantum-limited measurement in systems ranging from microwave qubits to gravity wave interferometers. As experimental systems push to ever smaller dimensions, extrinsic system properties can affect its internal material dynamics. In this paper, we identify surprising new regimes of material physics (defect-phonon and defect-defect dynamics) that are produced by dimensional confinement. Our models show that a range of tell-tale signatures, encoded in the characteristics of defect-induced noise, dissipation, and nonlinearity, are profoundly altered by geometry. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that the magnitude and character of this material-induced noise is transformed in microscale systems, providing an opportunity to improve the fidelity of quantum measurements. Moreover, we show that many emerging nano-electromechanical, cavity optomechanical and superconducting resonator systems are poised to probe these new regimes of dynamics, in both high and low field limits, providing a new way to explore the fundamental tenets of glass physics.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.06855
abstract: Using one channel to simulate another exactly with the aid of quantum no-signalling correlations has been studied recently. The one-shot no-signalling assisted classical zero-error simulation cost of non-commutative bipartite graphs has been formulated as semidefinite programmings [Duan and Winter, arXiv:1409.3426]. It remains unknown whether the one-shot (or asymptotic) no-signalling assisted zero-error classical simulation cost for general non-commutative graphs is multiplicative (resp. additive) or not. In this paper we address these issues and give a general sufficient condition for the multiplicativity of the one-shot simulation cost and the additivity of the asymptotic simulation cost of non-commutative bipartite graphs, which include all known cases such as extremal graphs and classical-quantum graphs. Applying this condition, we exhibit a large class of so-called \emph{cheapest-full-rank graphs} whose asymptotic zero-error simulation cost is given by the one-shot simulation cost. Finally, we disprove the multiplicativity of one-shot simulation cost by explicitly constructing a special class of qubit-qutrit non-commutative bipartite graphs.

abstract: We study a coupled array of coherently driven photonic cavities, which maps onto a driven-dissipative XY spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model with ferromagnetic couplings in the limit of strong optical nonlinearities. Using a site-decoupled mean-field approximation, we identify steady state phases with canted antiferromagnetic order, in addition to limit cycle phases, where oscillatory dynamics persist indefinitely. We also identify collective bistable phases, where the system supports two steady states among spatially uniform, antiferromagnetic, and limit cycle phases. We compare these mean-field results to exact quantum trajectories simulations for finite one-dimensional arrays. The exact results exhibit short-range antiferromagnetic order for parameters that have significant overlap with the mean-field phase diagram. In the mean-field bistable regime, the exact quantum dynamics exhibits real-time collective switching between macroscopically distinguishable states. We present a clear physical picture for this dynamics, and establish a simple relationship between the switching times and properties of the quantum Liouvillian.

abstract: Conditional pulse nulling (CPN) receiver is proposed by Dolinar to discriminate pulse position modulation (PPM) signals. The receiver using a beam splitter and an on-off photon detector can outperform the standard quantum limit (SQL) for PPM signals. In this paper, we apply this receiver to multi-pulse PPM (MPPM) and binary quantum coding signals, and use dynamic programming algorithm to optimize the control strategy. The MPPM signals is used to improve the band-utilization efficiency, and the binary quantum coding make the communication able to correct the error. Numerical simulation results show that the CPN receiver with optimized strategy can also outperform SQL for both MPPM and binary quantum coding signals.

abstract: Recently the power of positive partial transpose preserving (PPTp) and no-signalling(NS) codes in quantum communication has been studied. We continue with this line of research and show that the NS/PPTp/NS$\cap$PPTp codes assisted zero-error quantum capacity depends only on the non-commutative bipartite graph of the channel and the one-shot case can be computed efficiently by semidefinite programmings (SDP). As an example, the activated PPTp codes assisted zero-error quantum capacity is carefully studied. We then present a general SDP upper bound $Q_\Gamma$ of quantum capacity and show it is always smaller than or equal to the "Partial transposition bound" introduced by Holevo and Werner, and the inequality could be strict. This upper bound is found to be additive, and thus is an upper bound of the potential PPTp assisted capacity as well. We further demonstrate that $Q_\Gamma$ is strictly better than several previously known upper bounds for an explicit class of quantum channels. Finally, we show that $Q_\Gamma$ can be used to bound the super-activation of quantum capacity.

abstract: We study the statistical distribution of components in the non-perturbative parts of energy eigenfunctions (EFs), in which main bodies of the EFs lie. Our numerical simulations in five models show that deviation of the distribution from the prediction of random matrix theory (RMT) is useful in characterizing the process from nearly-integrable to chaotic, in a way somewhat similar to the nearest-level-spacing distribution. But, the statistics of EFs reveals some more properties, as described below. (i) In the process of approaching quantum chaos, the distribution of components shows a delay feature compared with the nearest-level-spacing distribution in most of the models studied. (ii) In the quantum chaotic regime, the distribution of components always shows small but notable deviation from the prediction of RMT in models possessing classical unterparts, while, the deviation can be almost negligible in models not possessing classical counterparts. (iii) In models whose Hamiltonian matrices possess a clear band structure, tails of EFs show statistical behaviors obviously different from those in the main bodies, while, the difference is smaller for Hamiltonian matrices without a clear band structure.

abstract: In 1975, two experimental groups have independently observed the 4$\pi$-symmetry of neutrons' spin, when passing through a static magnetic field, using a three-blade interferometer made from a single perfect Si-crystal (analogous to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer of light optics). In this article, we provide a complete analysis of the experiment, both from a theoretical and conceptual point of view. Firstly, we solve the Schr\"odinger equation in the weak potential approximation, to obtain the amplitude of the refracted and forward refracted beams, produced by the passage of neutrons through one of the three plates of the LLL interferometer. Secondly, we analyze their passage through a static magnetic field region. This allows us to find explicit expressions for the intensities of the four beams exiting the interferometer, two of which will be interfering and show a typical 4$\pi$-symmetry, when the strength of the magnetic field is varied. In the last part of the article, we provide a conceptual analysis of the experiment, showing a neutron's phase change, when passing through the magnetic field, is due to a longitudinal Stern-Gerlach effect, and not to a Larmor precession. We also emphasize that these experiments do not prove the observability of the sign change of the wave function, when a neutron is 2$\pi$ rotated, but strongly indicate that the latter, like any other elementary "particle," would be a genuinely non-spatial entity.

abstract: The entanglement and localization in eigenstates of strongly chaotic subsystems are studied as a function of their interaction strength. Excellent measures for this purpose are the von-Neumann entropy, Havrda-Charv{\' a}t-Tsallis entropies, and the averaged inverse participation ratio. All the entropies are shown to follow a remarkably simple exponential form, which describes a universal and rapid transition to nearly maximal entanglement for increasing interaction strength. An unexpectedly exact relationship between the subsystem averaged inverse participation ratio and purity is derived that infers the transition in the localization as well.

abstract: Quantum information encoded in optical photons can be transmitted over long distances with very high information density, and suffers from negligible thermal noise at room temperature. On the other hand, microwave photons at cryogenic temperatures can be confined in high quality resonators and strongly coupled to solid-state qubits, providing a quantum bus to connect qubits and a route to deterministic photonic non-linearities. The coherent interconversion of microwave and optical photons has therefore recently emerged as a highly desirable capability that would enable freely-scalable networks of optically-linked qubits, or large-scale photonic information processing with multi-photon interactions mediated by microwaves. Here, we propose a route to efficient and coherent microwave-optical conversion based on frequency mixing in Rydberg atoms. The interaction requires no microfabricated components or cavities, and is tunable, broadband, and both spatially and spectrally multimode.

As an important example, we derive generalized conditions to generate superradiant and subradiant states of the emitters, and demonstrate the ability of a structured environment to induce long-range quantum coherence. These results should have broad applications in quantum nanophotonics, and for the sensing of fluorescent sources in complex environments.

abstract: We report on a single photon source with highly tunable photon shape based on a cold ensemble of Rubidium atoms. We follow the DLCZ scheme to implement an emissive quantum memory, which can be operated as a photon pair source with controllable delay. We find that the temporal wave shape of the emitted read photon can be precisely controlled by changing the shape of the driving read pulse. We generate photons with temporal durations varying over three orders of magnitude up to 10 {\mu}s without a significant change of the read-out efficiency. We prove the non-classicality of the emitted photons by measuring their antibunching, showing near single photon behavior at low excitation probabilities. We also show that the photons are emitted in a pure state by measuring unconditional autocorrelation functions. Finally, to demonstrate the usability of the source for realistic applications, we create ultra-long single photons with a rising exponential or doubly peaked wave shape which are important for several quantum information tasks.

abstract: Bound states arise in many interactions among elementary field states, and are represented by poles in the scattering matrix. The emergent nature of bound states suggests that they play a perhaps under-appreciated role in specifying the ontologically relevant degrees of freedom pertaining to composite systems. The basics of this ontology are presented, and it is discussed in light of an example of Arsenijevi\' c et al.

abstract: Wiener processes (the formalization of Brownian Motion random walk) provide a basis for a model of discrete, mobile elements (Dx, Dy, Dz, Dt) that 'tile' space-time. The possible migrations of these elements are shown graphically via computer simulation. The Wiener process is modified by not taking the process to infinitesimals, and by also allowing the process to be a random walk in time as well as space. While migrations of a single element can easily be expressed with such a Wiener-like process, migrations within the completely tiled space-time (without introducing extra dimensions) require curvature. And since the quantum vacuum energy fluctuations imply curvature fluctuations, we use those curvature fluctuations in the model. The process of measurement, the nature of particle spin, and the quantum mechanical implications of the model are explored. The following results are obtained: In regions outside mass, the Schwarzschild metric is deduced (using a plausibility argument) without employing the General Relativity field equations. And inside mass, the model gives the remarkable result that for spherical masses greater than the Planck mass, there is no wave function, so, for example, the 2-slit experiment will not (even theoretically) show interference when performed with cannonballs.

We perform a number of single- and multi-node optimizations, including vectorization, multi-threading, cache blocking, as well as overlapping computation with communication. Using the TACC Stampede supercomputer, we simulate quantum circuits ("quantum software") of up to 40 qubits. We carry out a detailed performance analysis to show that our simulator achieves both high performance and high hardware efficiency, limited only by the sustainable memory and network bandwidth of the machine.

abstract: We present an exact master equation for a central spin-$1/2$ system coupled to a spin-$1/2$ bath in terms of hyperfine interaction, which provides a unified formalism for both free evolution and controlled dynamics of the central spin. The equation enables us to study controllability of dynamics processes with various degrees of non-Markovianity. We investigate the Overhauser's effect on decoherence dynamics of the central spin under different bath spectra and the system-bath coupling strengths. Nonperturbative leakage elimination approach is applied to the system to suppress decoherence in solid-state quantum information processing.

abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, the realization of an entirely guided-wave squeezing experiment at a telecom wavelength. The state generation relies on waveguide non-linear optics technology while squeezing collection and transmission are implemented by using only telecom fibre components. We observe up to $-1.83\pm0.05$ dB of squeezing emitted at 1542 nm in CW pumping regime. The compactness and stability of the experiment, compared to free-space configurations, represent a significant step towards achieving out-of-the-lab CV quantum communication, fully compatible with existing telecom fibre networks. We believe that this work stands as a promising approach for real applications as well as for "do-it-yourself" experiments

abstract: The implementation of holonomic quantum computation generally requires controllable and complicated interaction among addressable multi-level systems, which is challenging on superconducting circuit. Here, we propose a scalable architecture for non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation on a circuit QED lattice with hybrid transmon and photon encoding of the logical qubits in a decoherence-free subspace. With proper driven on the transmon, we can obtain tunable resonate interaction between the transmon and each of the resonators, which leads to arbitrary single-qubit operation on the encoded logical qubit. Meanwhile, for a nontrivial two-qubit gate, we only need resonate interactions among the three resonators from the two logical qubits, which can be induced by commonly coupled to a grounding SQUID with ac magnetic driven. More importantly, our scheme is achieved with all resonate interactions among the involved elements, and thus leads to quantum gates with very high fidelity. Therefore, our scheme opens up the possibility of realizing high fidelity universal holonomic quantum computation in solid-state system.

abstract: Distinguishability is a fundamental and operational task generally connected to information applications. In quantum information theory, from the postulates of quantum mechanics it often has an intrinsic limitation, which then dictates and also characterises capabilities of related information tasks. In this work, we consider discrimination between bipartite two-qubit unitary transformations by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and its relations to entangling capabilities of given unitaries. We show that a pair of entangling unitaries which do not contain local parts, if they are perfectly distinguishable by global operations, can also be perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. There also exist non-entangling unitaries, e.g. local unitaries, that are perfectly discriminated by global operations but not by LOCC. The results show that capabilities of LOCC are strictly restricted than global operations in distinguishing bipartite unitaries for a finite number of repetitions, contrast to discrimination of a pair of bipartite states and also to asymptotic discrimination of unitaries.

abstract: Linking classical microwave electrical circuits to the optical telecommunication band is at the core of modern communication. Future quantum information networks will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to link electronic quantum processors and memories via low-loss optical telecommunication networks. Efficient conversion can be achieved with electro-optical modulators operating at the single microwave photon level. In the standard electro-optic modulation scheme this is impossible because both, up- and downconverted, sidebands are necessarily present. Here we demonstrate true single sideband up- or downconversion in a triply resonant whispering gallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric free spectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a three orders of magnitude improvement of the electro-optical conversion efficiency reaching 0.1% photon number conversion for a 10GHz microwave tone at 0.42mW of optical pump power. The presented scheme is fully compatible with existing superconducting 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics technology and can be used for non-classical state conversion and communication. Our conversion bandwidth is larger than 1MHz and not fundamentally limited.

abstract: We have numerically simulated quantum tomography of single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gates with qubits represented by mesoscopic ensembles containing random numbers of atoms. Such ensembles of strongly interacting atoms in the regime of Rydberg blockade are known as Rydberg superatoms. The Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) in the regime of Rydberg blockade is used for deterministic Rydberg excitation in the ensemble, required for storage of quantum information in the collective state of the atomic ensemble and implementation of two-qubit gates. The optimized shapes of the STIRAP pulses are used to achieve high fidelity of the population transfer. Our simulations confirm validity and high fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates with Rydberg superatoms.

title: A relational approach to quantum reference frames for spins
authors: Jacques Pienaar
comments: 9 pages, 2 figures. Comments welcome

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1601.07320
abstract: If we interpret the quantum state as relational (i.e. it describes only relative properties of physical systems) then we can classify the properties of a quantum system as either `external' or `internal', according to whether or not they are affected by a change of the reference laboratory; the internal properties are defined to be independent of the choice of reference frame. For a system of quantum spins (qubits) the internal properties are typically assumed to be all properties that are preserved under proper spatial rotations of the laboratory apparatus, hence the associated symmetry group is SU(2). However, this assumes that the laboratory itself is not entangled to the system. One is therefore unable to account for the hypothetical possibility of one laboratory becoming entangled to the system, as seen by a second laboratory (a `Wigner's friend' scenario), in which case the relationship between the two laboratories is not a rotation, but is fundamentally quantum. To overcome this limitation, we propose that all observers should agree on how difficult it is to distinguish different parts of a composite system from one another, hence the fidelities between qubit subsystems should be preserved. By defining the internal properties to be the fidelities, we re-derive SU(2) as the symmetry group for N spins. We then consider a laboratory composed of qubits and include it as part of the system. In that case, we find that the symmetry group of the M-qubit joint system includes M-1 copies of the binary cyclic group Z(2). As a consequence, in the absence of an external reference frame, a single spin in a microscopic superposition relative to a large spin magnet is equivalent to a macroscopic superposition of the magnet relative to the single spin. We discuss the physical meaning of this result.

abstract: Multiparticle entangled quantum states, a key resource in quantum-enhanced metrology and computing, are usually generated by coherent operations exclusively. However, unusual forms of quantum dynamics can be obtained when environment coupling is used as part of the state generation. In this work, we used quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), based on nondestructive measurement with an optical microcavity, to deterministically generate different multiparticle entangled states in an ensemble of 36 qubit atoms in less than 5 microseconds. We characterized the resulting states by performing quantum tomography, yielding a time-resolved account of the entanglement generation. In addition, we studied the dependence of quantum states on measurement strength and quantified the depth of entanglement. Our results show that QZD is a versatile tool for fast and deterministic entanglement generation in quantum engineering applications.

abstract: We consider a general class of models, where a reinforcement learning (RL) agent learns from cyclic interactions with an external environment via classical signals. Perceptual inputs are encoded as quantum states, which are subsequently transformed by a quantum channel representing the agent's memory, while the outcomes of measurements performed at the channel's output determine the agent's actions. The learning takes place via stepwise modifications of the channel properties. They are described by an update rule that is inspired by the projective simulation (PS) model and equipped with a glow mechanism that allows for a backpropagation of policy changes, analogous to the eligibility traces in RL and edge glow in PS. In this way, the model combines features of PS with the ability for generalization, offered by its physical embodiment as a quantum system. We apply the agent to various setups of an invasion game and a grid world, which serve as elementary model tasks allowing a direct comparison with a basic classical PS agent.

abstract: We present a surprisingly simple three-dimensional Bloch sphere representation of a qutrit, i.e., a single three-level quantum system. We start with a symmetric state of a two-qubit system and relate it to the spin-1 representation. Using this representation we associate each qutrit state with a three-dimensional vector $\mathbf{a}$ and a metric tensor $\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}$ which satisfy $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{\hat\Gamma} \cdot \mathbf{a}\leq 1$. This resembles the well known condition for qubit Bloch vectors in which case $\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}=\hat{I}$. In our case the vector $\mathbf{a}$ corresponds to spin-1 polarisation, whereas the tensor $\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}$ is a function of polarisation uncertainties. Alternatively, $\mathbf{a}$ is a local Bloch vector of a symmetric two-qubit state and $\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}$ is a function of the corresponding correlation tensor. We also discuss how a purity of states and state-dynamics is depicted in our representation.

abstract: We prove an equivalence between exactly minimizing the number of $T$ gates in $n$-qubit quantum circuits over $CNOT$ and $T$ gates, together with the Clifford group powers of $T$, and minimum distance decoding in the length $2^n-1$ punctured Reed-Muller code of order $n-4$. The equivalence arises from an analysis of the particular form of phase polynomials generated by $CNOT$ and $T$ gates. As a consequence, we derive an algorithm for the optimization of $T$-count in $\{CNOT, T\}$ quantum circuits based on Reed-Muller decoders, along with a new upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on the number of $T$ gates required to implement an $n$-qubit unitary over $CNOT$ and $T$ gates. We further generalize this result to show that minimizing finer angle $Z$-rotations corresponds to decoding lower order binary Reed-Muller codes. In particular, we show that minimizing the number of $R_z(\pi/2^k)$ gates in circuits over $\{CNOT, R_z(\pi/2^k)\}$ corresponds to minimum distance decoding in the length $2^n-1$ punctured Reed-Muller code of order $(n-k-2)$.

abstract: We show how the same set-up and procedure, exploiting spatially multi-mode quantum correlations, allows the absolute calibration of a EMCCD camera from the analog regime down to the single photon counting level, just by adjusting the brightness of the quantum source. At single photon level EMCCD can be operated as an on-off detector, where quantum efficiency depends on the discriminating threshold. We develop a simple model to explain the connection of the two different regime demonstrating that the efficiency estimated in the analog (bright) regime allows to accurately predict the detector behaviour in the photo-counting regime and vice-versa. This work establishes a bridge between two regions of the optical measurements that up to now have been based on completely different standards, detectors and measurement techniques.

abstract: The certification of Bell nonlocality or quantum steering implies the use of incompatible measurements. Here we make these connection quantitative. We show that by certifying nonlocality or steering one of the parties can also estimate the amount of measurement incompatibility present in the measurements performed by the other party. This is done by showing that new robustness-based steering and nonlocality quantifiers give lower bound to previously proposed incompatibility quantifiers. Our results can be seen as device independent or one-sided device-independent quantifications of measurement incompatibility, in which one party can estimate how incompatible the other party's measurements are without relying on any description of these measurements.

abstract: Arrays of coupled photonic cavities driven by external lasers represent a highly controllable setup to explore photonic transport. In this paper we address (quasi)-steady states of this system that exhibit photonic currents introduced by engineering driving and dissipation. We investigate two approaches: in the first one, photonic currents arise as a consequence of a phase difference of applied lasers and in the second one, photons are injected locally and currents develop as they redistribute over the lattice. Effects of interactions are taken into account within a mean-field framework. In the first approach, we find that the current exhibits a resonant behavior with respect to the driving frequency. Weak interactions shift the resonant frequency toward higher values, while in the strongly interacting regime in our mean-field treatment the effect stems from multiphotonic resonances of a single driven cavity. For the second approach, we show that the overall lattice current can be controlled by incorporating few cavities with stronger dissipation rates into the system. These cavities serve as sinks for photonic currents and their effect is maximal at the onset of quantum Zeno dynamics.

abstract: Taking partial traces for computing reduced density matrices, or related functions, is a ubiquitous procedure in the quantum mechanics of composite systems. In this article, we present a thorough description of this function and analyze the number of elementary operations (ops) needed, under some possible alternative implementations, to compute it on a classical computer. As we notice, it is worthwhile doing some analytical developments in order to avoid making null multiplications and sums, what can considerably reduce the ops. For instance, for a bipartite system $\mathcal{H}_{a}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{b}$ with dimensions $d_{a}=\dim\mathcal{H}_{a}$ and $d_{b}=\dim\mathcal{H}_{b}$ and for $d_{a},d_{b}\gg1$, while a direct use of partial trace definition applied to $\mathcal{H}_{b}$ requires $\mathcal{O}(d_{a}^{6}d_{b}^{6})$ ops, its optimized implementation entails $\mathcal{O}(d_{a}^{2}d_{b})$ ops. In the sequence, we regard the computation of partial traces for general multipartite systems and describe Fortran code provided to implement it numerically. We also consider the calculation of reduced density matrices via Bloch's parametrization with generalized Gell Mann's matrices.

abstract: Frequently, subroutines in quantum computers have the structure $\mathcal{F}\mathcal{U}\mathcal{F}^{-1}$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is some unitary transform and $\mathcal{U}$ is performing a quantum computation. In this paper we suggest that if, in analogy to spin echoes, $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ can be implemented symmetrically such that $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ have the same hardware errors on the logical qubit level, a symmetry boost in the fidelity of the combined $\mathcal{F}\mathcal{U}\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ quantum operation results that in our simulations reaches up to a factor 10. While we find and document this symmetry boost here in the case of Shor's algorithm, we suggest that other quantum algorithms might profit from similar symmetry performance boosts whenever $\mathcal{F}\mathcal{U}\mathcal{F}^{-1}$ sub-units of the corresponding quantum algorithm can be identified.

abstract: In this work, we perform a careful study of an special arrangement of coupled systems that consists of two external harmonic oscillators weakly coupled to an arbitrary network (data bus) of strongly interacting oscillators. Our aim is to establish simple effective Hamiltonians and Liouvillians allowing an accurate description of the dynamics of the external oscillators regardless the topology of the network. By simple we mean an effective description using just a few degrees of freedom. In order to do that, we employed the machinery of symplectic formalism to generalize and expand the ideas presented in [1], where the specific case of an isolated (no thermal baths) chain is treated. With the methodology developed here, we are able to treat general topologies and, under certain structural conditions, to also include the interaction with external environments. In order to illustrate the predictability of the simplified dynamics, we present a comparative study with the predictions of the numerically obtained exact description in the context of propagation of energy through the network.

abstract: In two recent papers exact Hermite-Gaussian solutions to relativistic wave equations have been obtained for both electromagnetic and particle beams that include Gouy phase. The solutions for particle beams correspond to those of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. Here, distinct canonical and kinetic 4-momentum operators will be defined for quantum particles in matter wave beams. The kinetic momentum is equal to the canonical momentum minus the transient terms resulting from the transverse confinement centered on the beam waist. Three results are obtained. First, the observable energy of a particle in a beam depends on the rest mass of the particle, the kinetic axial momentum and the size of the beam waist but not on the beam mode numbers. Second, transient terms from transverse confinement couple into the canonical 4-momentum of the beam particles as a Lorentz covariant quantum 4-potential originating at the waist. The quantum 4-potential plays an analogous role in relativistic Hamiltonian quantum mechanics to the Bohm potential in the non-relativistic quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Third, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator must be defined in terms of canonical momentum operators. It is further shown that kinetic 4-momentum does not contribute to OAM indicating that OAM can therefore be regarded as a pure manifestation of quantum 4-potential.

abstract: It is argued that Niels Bohr ultimately arrived at positivistic and antirealist-flavored statements because of weaknesses in his initial objective of accounting for measurement in physical terms. Bohr's investigative approach faced a dilemma, the choices being (i) conceptual inconsistency or (ii) taking the classical realm as primitive. In either case, Bohr's `Complementarity' does not adequately explain or account for the emergence of a macroscopic, classical domain from a microscopic domain described by quantum mechanics. A diagnosis of the basic problem is offered, and an alternative way forward is indicated.

abstract: We introduce the concept of entropic nonsignalling correlations, i.e., entropies arising from probabilistic theories that are compatible with the fact that we cannot transmit information instantaneously. We characterize and show the relevance of these entropic correlations in a variety of different scenarios, ranging from typical Bell experiments to more refined descriptions such as bilocality and information causality. In particular, we apply the framework to derive the first entropic inequality testing genuine tripartite nonlocality in quantum systems of arbitrary dimension and also prove the first known monogamy relation for entropic Bell inequalities. Further, within the context of complex Bell networks, we show that entropic nonlocal correlations can be activated.

abstract: The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that a quantum circuit composed of Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Here we revisit this theorem and extend it to quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates, where T is the single-qubit 45-degree phase shift. We assume that the circuit outputs a bit string x obtained by measuring some subset of w qubits. Two simulation tasks are considered: (1) computing the probability of a given output x, and (2) sampling x from the output probability distribution. It is shown that these tasks can be solved on a classical computer in time $poly(n,m)+2^{0.5 t} t^3$ and $poly(n,m)+2^{0.23 t} t^3 w^4$ respectively, where t is the number of T-gates, m is the total number of gates, and n is the number of qubits. The proposed simulation algorithms may serve as a verification tool for medium-size quantum computations that are dominated by Clifford gates. The main ingredient of both algorithms is a subroutine for approximating the norm of an n-qubit state which is given as a linear combination of $\chi$ stabilizer states. The subroutine runs in time $\chi n^3 \epsilon^{-2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the relative error. We also develop techniques for approximating tensor products of "magic states" by linear combinations of stabilizer states. To demonstrate the power of the new simulation methods, we performed a classical simulation of a hidden shift quantum algorithm with 40 qubits, a few hundred Clifford gates, and nearly 50 T-gates.

abstract: By representing a quantum state and its evolution with the majorana stars on the Bloch sphere, the Majorana representation (MR) provide us an intuitive way to study a physical system with SU(2) symmetry. In this work, based on coherent states, we propose a method to establish generalization of MR for a general symmetry. By choosing a generalized coherent state as a reference state, we give a more general MR for both finite and infinite systems and the corresponding star equations are given. Using this method, we study the squeezed vacuum states for three different symmetries, Heisenberg-Weyl, SU(2) and SU(1,1), and express the effect of squeezing parameter on the distribution of stars. Furthermore, we also study the dynamical evolution of stars for an initial coherent state driven by a nonlinear Hamiltonian, and find that at a special time point, the stars are distributed on two orthogonal large circles.

abstract: We propose a mechanism for time reparametrization symmetry breaking in canonical gravity. We consider a model of spinor gravity, based on Sen's reformulation of canonical gravity as a spin system, with one additional long-range self-interacting massive spinor particle that is coupled to spinor gravity. The symmetry breaking is identified with the origin of the quantum mechanical non-unitary evolution. A part of our approach to deriving non-unitary time-dependent processes of wave functions follows the Diosi-Penrose argument on gravity's role in quantum state reduction.

abstract: We study the vacuum polarization of planar charged Dirac fermions by a strong Coulomb potential. Induced vacuum charge density is calculated and analyzed at the subcritical and supercritical Coulomb potentials for massless and massive fermions. For the massless case the induced vacuum charge density is localized at the origin when the Coulomb center charge is subcritical while it has a power-law tail when the Coulomb center charge is supercritical. The finite mass contribution into the induced charge due to the vacuum polarization is small and insignificantly distorts the Coulomb potential only at distances of order of the Compton length. The induced vacuum charge has a screening sign. As is known the quantum electrodynamics vacuum becomes unstable when the Coulomb center charge is increased from subcritical to supercritical values. In the supercritical Coulomb potential the quantum electrodynamics vacuum acquires the charge due to the so-called real vacuum polarization. We calculate the real vacuum polarization charge density. Screening of the Coulomb center charge are briefly discussed. We expect that our results will be helpful for more deep understanding of the fundamental problem of quantum electrodynamics and can as a matter of principle be tested in graphene with a supercritical Coulomb impurity.

abstract: Quantum metrology exploits entangled states of particles to improve sensing precision beyond the limit achievable with uncorrelated particles. All previous methods required detection noise levels below this standard quantum limit to realize the benefits of the intrinsic sensitivity provided by these states. Remarkably, a recent proposal has shown that, in principle, such low-noise detection is not a necessary requirement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a widely applicable method for entanglement-enhanced measurements without low-noise detection. Using an intermediate magnification step, we perform squeezed state metrology 8 dB below the standard quantum limit with a detection system that has a noise floor 10 dB above the standard quantum limit. Beyond its conceptual significance, this method eases implementation complexity and is expected to find application in next generation quantum sensors.

abstract: We consider the separability problem for bipartite quantum states from a graph theoretical perspective. Earlier it was proved that the degree criterion is the graph theoretical counterpart of familiar PPT criterion for separability. There are entangled states with positive partial transpose for which degree criterion fails. Here, we indicate a tighter bound on entangled states. We have developed the idea of some non-traditional symmetries in a graph that are necessary for separability. Moreover, we have studied graph isomorphisms as a tool for mixed state entanglement generation from mixed separable states.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Whether the total angular momentum of the photon can be separated into spin and orbital parts has been a long-standing problem due to the constraint of transversality condition on its vector wavefunction. A careful analysis shows that the situation arises from a misuse of the constraint in quantum mechanics. To use the constraint properly, we convert the vector representation into a two-component representation in which the wavefunction is not constrained by any conditions. Upon doing so, we not only separate the spin conceptually from the orbital angular momentum but also identify the Berry gauge in which the two-component wavefunction can be canonically quantized. A corollary is that only in one particular Berry gauge can a radiation field be canonically quantized in terms of the plane waves. The degree of freedom to fix the Berry gauge, which reflects a symmetry of the constraint, turns out to have observable quantum effects.

abstract: The possibility of constructing a complete, continuous Wigner function for any quantum system has been a subject of investigation for over 50 years. A key system that has served to illustrate the difficulties of this problem has been an ensemble of spins. While numerous attempts have come close to generating a complete Wigner phase-space description, each has either being artificial in its construction or fallen short of realising this ambition. Here we present a natural method of constructing Wigner functions that can be used to fully describe any quantum object or systems of systems. We see no reason why our approach should be limited to non-relativistic quantum mechanics; it may even lead to phase-space methods for more exotic frameworks such as string theory. In addition we show that the natural visual representation of the quantum state by the Wigner function leads to multiple and intuitive entanglement measures.

abstract: The Abbe diffraction limit prevents focusing monochromatic light in the far-field beyond a spot size half its wavelength. For microscopy purposes at the nanoscale, namely nanoscopy, such limit can be circumvented by either using near-fields, which are not diffraction-limited, or, in fluorescence nanoscopy, by manipulating bright and dark states of the fluorescent markers. Here we propose and analyze an alternative approach for far-field nanoscopy based on using coherent polychromatic light, that is, ultrashort pulses. Such pulses have spectral bandwidths comparable, and even larger in the attosecond regime, than a carrier optical frequency. We show that a train of ultrashort pulses can be used to excite markers with nanoscale resolution. In particular, we show that they can be focused to a spot size given by the wavelength associated to its spectral bandwidth and that they can excite a two-level marker with an optical transition. The excitation mechanism is non-conventional for two-level systems, as it relies on the existence of processes where an excitation is created together with the emission of a photon. The detection of the light emitted after fluorescence, or any other method used to detect the excitation, would thus lead to far-field nanoscopy. In this sense, our results open the door to design fluorescence nanoscopes that circumvent the Abbe's barrier without manipulating the states of the markers but using coherent polychromatic light.

abstract: We consider the propagation of Gaussian beams in a waveguide with gain and loss in the paraxial approximation governed by the Schr\"odinger equation. We derive equations of motion for the beam in the semiclassical limit that are valid when the waveguide profile is locally well approximated by quadratic functions. For Hermitian systems, without any loss or gain, these dynamics are given by Hamilton's equations for the center of the beam and its conjugate momentum. Adding gain and/or loss to the waveguide introduces a non-Hermitian component, causing the width of the Gaussian beam to play an important role in its propagation. Here we show how the width affects the motion of the beam and how this may be used to filter Gaussian beams located at the same initial position based on their width.

abstract: In finite dimensions, we provide characterizations of the quantum dynamical semigroups that do not decrease the von Neumann, the Tsallis and the Renyi entropies, as well as a family of functions of density operators strictly related to the Schatten norms. A few remarkable consequences --- in particular, a description of the associated infinitesimal generators --- are derived, and some significant examples are discussed. Extensions of these results to semigroups of trace-preserving positive (i.e., not necessarily completely positive) maps and to a more general class of quantum entropies are also considered.

abstract: We test ideas put forward e.g in arXiv:1508.02368, which suggest that using rates in quantum optics can lead to better indicators of non-classicality for states of quantum optical fields with undefined photon numbers. By rate we mean the ratio of registered photons in a given detector to the total number of detected photons in all detectors in the experiment. For the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect for parametric down conversion fields, we show that by using two detector correlation functions which are defined in terms of averages of products of measured rates, rather than usual intensities, one can observe non -- classical visibilities beyond $1/2$ for significantly higher pump rates. At such rates we already have a partially stimulated emission which leads to significant amplitudes for multiple pairs production, still the new approach allows to clearly see the non-classical dip.

The quantum algorithm is logarithmic in the dimension of the input space and independent of the size of the dataset if the data is given as quantum information.

abstract: Remarkably, it has been shown that in principle, security proofs for quantum key-distribution (QKD) protocols can be independent of assumptions on the devices used and even of the fact that the adversary is limited by quantum theory. All that is required instead is the absence of any hidden information flow between the laboratories, a condition that can be enforced either by shielding or by space-time causality. All known schemes for such Causal Key Distribution (CKD) that offer noise-tolerance (and, hence, must use privacy amplification as a crucial step) require multiple devices carrying out measurements in parallel on each end of the protocol, where the number of devices grows with the desired level of security. We investigate the power of the adversary for more practical schemes, where both parties each use a single device carrying out measurements consecutively. We provide a novel construction of attacks that is strictly more powerful than the best known attacks and has the potential to decide the question whether such practical CKD schemes are possible in the negative.

abstract: We study two extensions to the Jaynes Cummings model described by Markovian master equations with Lindblad operators causing either dephasing or photon losses solely involving the cavity mode. We treat the two-level atom as the central system under investigation, while the mode of the cavity plays the role of a near environment coupled via the Lindblad operators to an imagined far environment. We show that increasing the dephasing or damping parameter of the cavity systematically slows the decoherence of the atom. The exact solvability allows us to determine the relation to the quantum Zeno effect and the perturbative regime.

abstract: We address an eigenvalue problem for the ultrarelativistic (Cauchy) operator $(-\Delta )^{1/2}$, whose action is restricted to functions that vanish beyond the interior of a unit sphere in three spatial dimensions. We provide high accuracy spectral datafor lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this infinite spherical well problem. Our focus is on radial and orbital shapes of eigenfunctions. The spectrum consists of an ordered set of strictly positive eigenvalues which naturally splits into non-overlapping, orbitally labelled $E_{(k,l)}$ series. For each orbital label $l=0,1,2,...$ the label $k =1,2,...$ enumerates consecutive $l$-th series eigenvalues. Each of them is $2l+1$-degenerate. The $l=0$ eigenvalues series $E_{(k,0)}$ are identical with the set of even labeled eigenvalues for the $d=1$ Cauchy well: $E_{(k,0)}(d=3)=E_{2 k}(d=1)$. Likewise, the eigenfunctions $\psi_{(k,0 )}(d=3)$ and $\psi_{2k }(d=1)$ show affinity. We have identified the generic functional form of eigenfunctions of the spherical well which appear to be composed of a product of a solid harmonic and of a suitable purely radial function. The method to evaluate (approximately) the latter has been found to follow the universal pattern which effectively allows to skip all, sometimes involved, intermediate calculations (those were in usage, while computing the eigenvalues for $l \leq 3$).

abstract: In this paper, first a simple formula is presented for time evolution of the von Neumann entropy under the Lindblad equation for a density matrix. Then, the following question is posed: In a quantum open system with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, what is a master equation for the quantum state that keeps the internal energy of the system constant in time? Here, this question is answered under the assumption of the Lindblad form for the equation. Time evolution of the von Neumann entropy is discussed, and a compact expression is derived for it. As an illustrative example, the time-dependent harmonic oscillator is analyzed, and the Lindbladian operator is determined with the help of a Lie-algebraic structure. It is shown how the sign of the time derivative of the von Neumann entropy is determined in accordance with the time dependence of the Hamiltonian.

abstract: We optomechanically measure the vibrations of a nanomechanical system made of a graphene membrane suspended on a silicon nitride nanoresonator. When probing the thermal noise of the coupled nanomechanical device, we observe a significant deviation from the normal mode expansion. It originates from the heterogeneous character of mechanical dissipation over the spatial extension of coupled eigenmodes, which violates one of the fundamental prerequisite for employing this commonly used description of the nanoresonators' thermal noise. We subsequently measure the local mechanical susceptibility and demonstrate that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem still holds and permits a proper evaluation of the thermal noise of the nanomechanical system. Since it naturally becomes delicate to ensure a good spatial homogeneity at the nanoscale, this approach is fundamental to correctly describe the thermal noise of nanomechanical systems which ultimately impact their sensing capacity.

abstract: We explore the geometric interpretation of a diabatic, two-photon Raman process as a rotation on the Bloch sphere for a pseudo-spin-1/2 system. The spin state of a spin-1/2 quantum system can be described by a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and its evolution during a Raman pulse is a trajectory on the sphere determined by properties of the optical beams: the pulse area, the relative intensities and phases, and the relative frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate key features of this model with a $^{87}$Rb spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, which allows us to examine spatially dependent signatures of the Raman beams. The two-photon detuning allows us to precisely control the spin density and imprinted relative phase profiles, as we show with a coreless vortex. With this comprehensive understanding and intuitive geometric interpretation, we use the Raman process to create and tailor as well as study and characterize exotic topological spin textures in spinor BECs.

abstract: Since the well-known PT symmetry has its fundamental significance and implication in physics, where PT denotes the combined operation of space-inversion P and time-reversal T, it is extremely important and intriguing to completely classify exotic PT-invariant topological metals and to physically realize them. Here we, for the first time, establish a rigorous classification of topological metals that are protected by the PT symmetry using KO-theory. As a physically realistic example, a PT-invariant nodal loop (NL) model in a 3D Brillouin zone is constructed, whose topological stability is revealed through its PT-symmetry-protected nontrivial Z2 topological charge. Based on these exact results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize and to detect tunable PT-invariant topological NL states with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, in which atoms with two hyperfine spin states are loaded in a spin-dependent 3D OL and two pairs of Raman lasers are used to create out-of-plane spin-flip hopping with site-dependent phase. Such a realistic cold-atom setup can yield topological NL states, having a tunable ring-shaped band-touching line with the two-fold degeneracy in the bulk spectrum and non-trivial surface states. The states are actually protected by the combined PT symmetry even in the absence of both P and T symmetries, and are characterized by a Z2-type invariant (a quantized Berry phase). Remarkably, we demonstrate with numerical simulations that (i) the characteristic NL can be detected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener oscillation; (ii) the topological invariant may be measured based on the time-of-flight imaging; and (iii) the surface states may be probed through Bragg spectroscopy. The present proposal for realizing topological NL states in cold atom systems may provide a unique experimental platform for exploring exotic PT-invariant topological physics.

abstract: Penning ionization reactions in merged beams with precisely controlled collision energies have been shown to accurately probe quantum mechanical effects in reactive collisions. A complete microscopic understanding of the reaction is, however, faced with two major challenges---the highly excited character of the reaction's entrance channel and the limited precision of even the best state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. Here, we suggest photoassociation spectroscopy as a tool to identify the character of orbiting resonances in the entrance channel and probe the ionization width as a function of inter-particle separation. We introduce the basic concept and discuss the general conditions under which this type of spectroscopy will be successful.

abstract: In a thermal ensemble of atoms driven by coherent fields, how does evolution of quantum superposition compete with classical dynamics of optical pumping and atomic diffusion? Is it optical pumping that first prepares a thermal ensemble, with coherent superposition developing subsequently or is it the other way round: coherently superposed atoms driven to steady state via optical pumping? Using a stroboscopic probing technique, here we experimentally explore these questions. A 100 ns pulse is used to probe an experimentally simulated, closed three-level, lambda-like configuration in rubidium atoms, driven by strong coherent control and incoherent fields. Temporal evolution of probe transmission shows an initial overshoot with turn-on of control, resulting in a scenario akin to lasing without inversion (LWI). The corresponding rise time is dictated by coherent dynamics, with a distinct experimental signature of half-cycle Rabi flop in a thermal ensemble of atoms. Our results indicate that, in fact, optical pumping drives the atoms to a steady state in a significantly longer time-scale that sustains superposed dark states. Eventual control turn-off leads to a sudden fall in transmission with an ubiquitous signature for identifying closed and open systems. Numerical simulations and toy-model predictions confirm our claims. These studies reveal new insights into a rich and complex dynamics associated with atoms in thermal ensemble, which are otherwise absent in state-prepared, cold atomic ensembles.

abstract: After a brief historical review of ergodicity and mixing in dynamics, particularly in quantum dynamics, we introduce definitions of quantum ergodicity and mixing using the structure of the system's energy levels and spacings. Our definitions are consistent with usual understanding of ergodicity and mixing. Two parameters concerning the degeneracy in energy levels and spacings are introduced; their relations to quantum ergodicity and mixing are demonstrated with right triangular billiards. With this billiard system, we find that a system is ergodic in its quantum dynamics may not be ergodic in its classical dynamics. At the end, we argue that, besides ergodicity and mixing, there may exist a third class of quantum dynamics which is characterized by a maximized entropy.

abstract: Vibrational spectra can be computed without storing full-dimensional vectors by using low-rank sum-of-products (SOP) basis functions. We introduce symmetry constraints in the SOP basis functions to make it possible to separately calculate states in different symmetry subgroups. This is done using a power method to compute eigenvalues and an alternating least squares method to optimize basis functions. Owing to the fact that the power method favours the convergence of the lowest states, one must be careful not to exclude basis functions of some symmetries. Exploiting symmetry facilitates making assignments and improves the accuracy. The method is applied to the acetonitrile molecule.

abstract: We investigate quantum dynamics of a generic model of light-matter interaction in the context of high impedance waveguides, focusing on the behavior of the emitted photonic states, in the framework of the spin-boson model Quantum quenches as well as scattering of an incident coherent pulse are studied using two complementary methods. First, we develop an approximate ansatz for the electromagnetic waves based on a single multimode coherent state wavefunction; formally, this approach combines ideas from adiabatic renormalization, the Born-Markov approximation, and input-output theory. Second, we present numerically exact results for scattering of a weak intensity pulse by using NRG calculations. NRG provides a benchmark for any linear response property throughout the ultra-strong coupling regime. We find that in a sudden quantum quench, the coherent state approach produces physical artifacts, such as improper relaxation to the steady state. These previously unnoticed problems are related to the simplified form of the ansatz that generates spurious correlations within the bath. In the scattering problem, NRG is used to find the transmission and reflection of a single photon, as well as the inelastic scattering of that single photon. Simple analytical formulas are established and tested against the NRG data that predict quantitatively the transport coefficients for up to moderate environmental impedance. These formulas resolve pending issues regarding the presence of inelastic losses in the spin-boson model near absorption resonances, and could be used for comparison to experiments in Josephson waveguide QED. Finally, the scattering results using the coherent state wavefunction approach are compared favorably to the NRG results for very weak incident intensity. We end our study by presenting results at higher power where the response of the system is nonlinear.

The setup uses spatially low coherent light source, for which the outcome of measurement is dependent on the presence of a reflecting surface and a linear polarizer. The introduction of a reflecting surface induces enhanced side scattering. The enhancement has specific patterns for pure water, ions and nanoparticles and can be employed to detect refractive index of liquids at high sensitivity. The differential enhancement can be used as an optical magnetometer that sensitively senses magnetic moments of colloidal magnetic nanoparticles at concentration untenable by other measurement techniques.

abstract: In electronic structure calculations, various material properties can be obtained by means of computing the total energy of a system as well as derivatives of the total energy w.r.t. atomic positions. The derivatives, also known as Hellman-Feynman forces, require, because of practical computational reasons, the discretized charge density and wave functions having continuous second derivatives in the whole solution domain. We describe an application of isogeometric analysis (IGA), a spline modification of finite element method (FEM), to achieve the required continuity. The novelty of our approach is in employing the technique of B\'ezier extraction to add the IGA capabilities to our FEM based code for ab-initio calculations of electronic states of non-periodic systems within the density-functional framework, built upon the open source finite element package SfePy. We compare FEM and IGA in benchmark problems and several numerical results are presented.

abstract: Circulators are non-reciprocal circuit elements integral to technologies including radar systems, microwave communication transceivers, and the readout of quantum information devices. Their non-reciprocity arises from the interference of microwaves over the centimetre-scale of the signal wavelength in the presence of bulky magnetic media that break time-reversal symmetry. Here we realize a completely passive on-chip microwave circulator with size one-thousandth the wavelength by exploiting the chiral, slow-light response of a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum Hall regime. For an integrated GaAs device with 330 um diameter and 1 GHz centre frequency, a non-reciprocity of 25 dB is observed over a 50 MHz bandwidth. Furthermore, the direction of circulation can be selected dynamically by varying the magnetic field, an aspect that may enable reconfigurable passive routing of microwave signals on-chip.

abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is one of the key models of condensed matter physics, which holds a potential for explaining the mystery of high-temperature superconductivity. Recent progress in ultracold atoms in optical lattices has paved the way to studying the model's phase diagram using the tools of quantum simulation, which emerged as a promising alternative to the numerical calculations plagued by the infamous sign problem. However, the temperatures achieved using elaborate laser cooling protocols so far have been too high to show the appearance of antiferromagnetic and superconducting quantum phases directly. In this work, we demonstrate that using the machinery of dissipative quantum state engineering, one can efficiently prepare antiferromagnetic order in present-day experiments with ultracold fermions. The core of the approach is to add incoherent laser scattering in such a way that the antiferromagnetic state emerges as the dark state of the driven-dissipative dynamics. In order to elucidate the development of the antiferromagnetic order we employ two complementary techniques: Monte Carlo wave function simulations for small systems and a recently proposed variational method for open quantum systems, operating in the thermodynamic limit. The controlled dissipation channels described in this work are straightforward to add to already existing experimental setups.

abstract: The perspective of probing quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium under well controlled conditions is attracting enormous attention in recent years, a perspective that extends to the study of fermionic systems. In this work, we present an argument that precisely captures the dynamics causing equilibration and Gaussification under quadratic non-interacting fermionic Hamiltonians. Specifically, based on two basic assumptions - the initial clustering of correlations and the Hamiltonian exhibiting delocalizing transport - we prove that systems become locally indistinguishable from fermionic Gaussian states on precisely controlled time scales. The argument gives rise to rigorous instances of a convergence to a generalized Gibbs ensemble. This argument is general enough to allow for arbitrary pure and mixed initial states, including thermal and ground states of interacting models, and large classes of systems, including high-dimensional lattice and classes of spin systems. Our results allow to develop an intuition of equilibration that is expected to be generally valid, and at the same time relates to current experiments of cold atoms in optical lattices.

Such a path integral turns out to be a convenient tool for making estimations for the negativity.

abstract: The transient processes of electron transport in nano-scale devices exhibit special phenomena that exist only in the transient regime. Besides how fast the steady states are approached, one interesting aspect of transient transport arises from its strong dependence on the initial state of the system. Here we address the issue of how the symmetries embedded in the initial state interplay with those of the system structure in the course of transient transports. We explicitly explore the transient currents arising from various initial occupations in a double-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. We find symmetry relations between the transient in-tunneling and out-tunneling dynamics for initially empty or full quantum dots when the energy levels in the electrodes are symmetrically distributed with respect to the energy levels in the QDs. This is true for whatever applied fluxes. We also find the flux-even components of the currents and the flux-odd components of the currents exhibit distinct cross-lead symmetric relations.

abstract: Vacuum excitation by time-varying boundary conditions is not only of fundamental importance but also has recently been confirmed in a laboratory experiment. In this paper, we study the vacuum excitation of a scalar field by the instantaneous appearance and disappearance of a both-sided Dirichlet wall in the middle of a 1D cavity, as toy models of bifurcating and merging spacetimes, respectively. It is shown that the energy flux emitted positively diverges on the null lines emanating from the (dis-)appearance event, which is analogous to the result of Anderson and DeWitt. This result suggests that the semiclassical effect prevents the spacetime both from bifurcating and merging. In addition, we argue that the diverging flux in the disappearance case plays an interesting role to compensate for the lowness of ambient energy density after the disappearance, which is lower than the zero-point level.

abstract: Analyzing some well established facts, we give a model-independent parameterization of black hole quantum computing in terms of a set of macro and micro quantities and their relations. These include the relations between the extraordinarily-small energy gap of black hole qubits and important time-scales of information-processing, such as, scrambling time and Page's time. We then show, confirming and extending previous results, that other systems of nature with identical quantum informatics features are attractive Bose-Einstein systems at the critical point of quantum phase transition. Here we establish a complete isomorphy between the quantum computational properties of these two systems. In particular, we show that the quantum hair of a critical condensate is strikingly similar to the quantum hair of a black hole. Irrespectively whether one takes the similarity between the two systems as a remarkable coincidence or as a sign of a deeper underlying connection, the following is evident. Black holes are not unique in their way of quantum information processing and we can manufacture black hole based quantum computers in labs by taking advantage of quantum criticality.

abstract: We study harmonically trapped atoms subjected to an equal combination of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling induced by Raman transition. We first examine the wave function and the degeneracy of the single-particle ground state, followed by a study of two weakly interacting bosons or fermions. For the two-particle ground state, we focus on the effects of the interaction on the degeneracy, the spin density profiles, and the density-density correlation functions. Finally we show how these studies help us to understand the many-body properties of the system.

abstract: In the present paper we have developed a Non-Commutative (NC) generalization of perfect fluid model from first principles, in a Hamiltonian framework. The noncommutativity is introduced at the Lagrangian (particle) coordinate space brackets and the induced NC fluid bracket algebra for the Eulerian (fluid) field variables is derived. Together with a Hamiltonian this NC algebra generates the generalized fluid dynamics that satisfies exact local conservation laws for mass and energy thereby maintaining mass and energy conservation. However, nontrivial NC correction terms appear in charge and energy fluxes. Other non-relativistic spacetime symmetries of the NC fluid are also discussed in detail. This constitutes the NC fluid dynamics and kinematics. In the second part we construct an extension of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model based on the NC fluid dynamics presented here. We outline the way in which NC effects generate cosmological perturbations bringing in anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the model. We also derive a NC extended Friedmann equation.

abstract: The recent experimental realization of Bose-Fermi superfluid mixtures of dilute ultracold atomic gases has opened new perspectives in the study of quantum many-body systems. Depending on the values of the scattering lengths and the amount of bosons and fermions, a uniform Bose-Fermi mixture is predicted to exhibit a fully mixed phase, a fully separated phase or, in addition, a purely fermionic phase coexisting with a mixed phase. The occurrence of this intermediate configuration has interesting consequences when the system is nonuniform. In this work we theoretically investigate the case of solitonic solutions of coupled Bogoliubov-de Gennes and Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the fermionic and bosonic components, respectively. We show that, in the partially separated phase, a dark soliton in Fermi superfluid is accompanied by a broad bosonic component in the soliton, forming a dark-bright soliton which keeps full spatial coherence.

abstract: Understanding the quantum nature of light in situations where it interacts very strongly with matter is a question that is becoming experimentally relevant for qubits coupled to new classes of metamaterials with impedance close to the quantum limit. This problem enters the realm of many-body physics because the effective fine structure constant reaches values of order one, so that perturbative methods and concepts of quantum optics cannot be simply borrowed. Remarkably, describing the time-dependent state vector in terms of quantum-superposed classical (coherent) states provides not only a very efficient computational tool, but also a simple way to rationalize the physics at play. By analyzing the Wigner distribution of the radiated field, we find that spontaneous atomic decay does not lead to the standard emission of one-photon Fock states, but rather to the release of many-body Schr\"odinger cats.

abstract: Measurements of current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a high quality Al/Al$_2$O$_3$/Al junction at temperatures ranging from 3.5 K to 300 K have been used to extract the barrier properties. Fitting results using Simmons' model led to a constant value of barrier width $s$$\sim$20.8~$\textrm{\AA}$ and a continuous increase in the barrier height with decreasing temperature. The latter is used to determine the energy band gap temperature dependence and average phonon frequency $\omega$ = 2.05 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ sec$^{-1}$ in Al$_2$O$_3$, which adds confidence to the precision of our measurements. The barrier parameters are used to extract the temperature dependent dwell times in tunneling ($\tau_D$ = 3.6 $\times$ 10$^{-16}$ sec at mid-barrier energies) and locate resonances above the barrier.

abstract: In ferromagnet/normal metal heterostructures, spin pumping and spin-transfer torques are two reciprocal processes that occur concomitantly. Their interplay introduces a dynamic feedback effect interconnecting energy dissipation channels of both magnetization and current. By solving the spin diffusion process in the presence of the spin Hall effect in the normal metal, we show that the dynamic feedback gives rise to: (i) a nonlinear magnetic damping that is crucial to sustain uniform steady-state oscillations of a spin Hall oscillator at large angles. (ii) a frequency dependent spin Hall magnetoimpedance that reduces to the spin Hall magnetoresistance in the dc limit.

abstract: The path integral quantization method is applied to a relativistically covariant version of the Hopfield model, which represents a very interesting mesoscopic framework for the description of the interaction between quantum light and dielectric quantum matter, with particular reference to the context of analogue gravity. In order to take into account the constraints occurring in the model, we adopt the Faddeev-Jackiw approach to constrained quantization in the path integral formalism. In particular we demonstrate that the propagator obtained with the Faddeev-Jackiw approach is equivalent to the one which, in the framework of Dirac canonical quantization for constrained systems, can be directly computed as the vacuum expectation value of the time ordered product of the fields. Our analysis also provides an explicit example of quantization of the electromagnetic field in a covariant gauge and coupled with the polarization field, which is a novel contribution to the literature on the Faddeev-Jackiw procedure.

abstract: Tensor networks provide a natural framework for exploring holographic duality because they obey entanglement area laws. They have been used to construct explicit simple models realizing many of the interesting structural features of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator reconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the holographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models obey the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for all boundary regions, whether connected or not, a fact closely related to known properties of the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that all boundary regions faithfully encode the physics of their entire bulk entanglement wedges, not just their smaller causal wedges. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the partition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the minimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the analog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the bulk minimal surface is displaced and the entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the entanglement of the bulk field ultimately creates the analog of a black hole, with an associated Hawking-Page phase transition. Extrapolating bulk correlation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling dimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small number of low-dimension operators and the rest, a known necessary condition for holography. While we primarily focus on the AdS/CFT case, the main results of the article define a more general form of bulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to other spacetimes.

abstract: We investigate the von Neumann entanglement entropy and Schmidt gap in the ground state of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice for square and cylindrical subsystems. We find that, for both the subsystems, the free-fermionic contribution to the entanglement entropy $S_E$ exhibits signatures of the phase transitions between the gapless and gapped phases. However, we find that $S_E$ does not show an expected monotonic behaviour as a function of the coupling $J_z$ between the suitably defined one-dimensional chains within the gapless phase for either geometry; moreover the system generically reaches a point of minimum entanglement within the gapless phase before the entanglement saturates or increases again until the gapped phase is reached. This may be attributed to the competition between the nearest neighbour correlation functions of the $x-x$ and $z-z$ bonds, and to the onset of gapless $\vec{k}$-modes in the bulk spectrum. On the other hand $S_E$ always monotonically varies with $J_z$ in the gapped phase independent of the subregion size or shape. Finally, further confirming the Li-Haldane conjecture, we find that the Schmidt gap $\Delta$ defined from the entanglement spectrum also signals the topological transitions but only if there are corresponding zero energy Majorana edge states that simultaneously appear or disappear across the transitions. We analytically corroborate some of our results on entanglement entropy, Schmidt gap and the bulk-edge correspondence using perturbation theory.

abstract: We have applied the concept of superradiance introduced by Dicke in 1954 to the ISM by extending the corresponding analysis to the magnetic dipole interaction characterizing the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line. Although it is unlikely that superradiance could take place in thermally relaxed regions, in situations where the conditions necessary for superradiance are met (i.e., close atomic spacing, high velocity coherence, population inversion, and long dephasing time-scales compared to those related to coherent behavior), our results suggest that relatively low levels of population inversion over short astronomical length-scales (e.g., as compared to those required for maser amplification) can lead to the cooperative behavior required for superradiance in the ISM. Given the results of our analysis, we expect the observational properties of superradiance to be characterized by the emission of high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like features potentially taking place over short periods ranging from minutes to days.

abstract: We apply the concept of superradiance introduced by Dicke in 1954 to the OH molecule 1612 MHz spectral line often used for the detection of masers in circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. As the detection of 1612 MHz OH masers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars implies the existence of a population inversion and a high level of velocity coherence, and that these are two necessary requirements for superradiance, we investigate whether superradiance can also happen in these regions. Superradiance is characterized by high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like features taking place over time-scales on the order of seconds to years, depending on the size and physical conditions present in the regions harboring such sources of radiation. Our analysis suggests that superradiance provides a valid explanation for previous observations of intensity flares detected in that spectral line for the U Orionis Mira star and the IRAS18276-1431 pre-planetary nebula.

abstract: We propose a class of photonic Floquet topological insulators based on staggered helical lattices and an efficient numerical method for calculating their Floquet bandstructure. The lattices support anomalous Floquet topological insulator phases with vanishing Chern number and tunable topological transitions. At the critical point of the topological transition, the bandstructure hosts a single unpaired Dirac cone, which yields a variety of unusual transport effects: a discrete analogue of conical diffraction, weak antilocalization not limited by intervalley scattering, and suppression of Anderson localization. Unlike previous designs, the effective gauge field strength can be controlled via lattice parameters such as the inter-helix distance, significantly reducing radiative losses and enabling applications such as switchable topological wave-guiding.

abstract: We review a series of works whose aim is to provide a spectral realization of the Riemann zeros and that culminate in a physicist's proof of the Riemann hypothesis. These results are obtained analyzing the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of a massless Dirac fermion in a region of Rindler spacetime that contains moving mirrors whose accelerations are related to the prime numbers. We show that a zero on the critical line becomes an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian in the limit where the mirrors become transparent, and the self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian is adjusted accordingly with the phase of the zeta function. We have also considered the spectral realization of zeros off the critical line using a non self-adjoint operator, but its properties imply that those zeros do not exist. In the derivation of these results we made several assumptions that need to be established more rigorously.

abstract: We revisit the conserved quantities of the spin-1/2 XY model with open boundary conditions. In the absence of a transverse field, we find new families of local charges and show that half of the seeming conservation laws are conserved only if the number of sites is odd. In even chains the set of noninteracting charges is abelian, like in the periodic case when the number of sites is odd. In odd chains the set is doubled and becomes non-abelian, like in even periodic chains. The dependence of the charges on the parity of the chain's size undermines the common belief that the thermodynamic limit of diagonal ensembles exists. We consider also the transverse-field Ising chain, where the situation is more ordinary. The generalization to the XY model in a transverse field is not straightforward and we propose a general framework to carry out similar calculations. We conjecture the form of the bulk part of the local charges and discuss the emergence of quasilocal conserved quantities. We provide evidence that in a region of the parameter space there is a reduction of the number of quasilocal conservation laws. As a by-product, we study a class of block-Toeplitz-plus-Hankel operators and identify the conditions that their symbols satisfy in order to commute with a given block-Toeplitz.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics following a global parameter quench for two 1D models with variable-range power-law interactions: a long-range transverse Ising model, which has recently been realised in chains of trapped ions, and a long-range lattice model for spinless fermions with long-range tunnelling. For the transverse Ising model, the spreading of correlations and growth of entanglement are computed using numerical matrix product state techniques, and are compared with exact solutions for the fermionic tunnelling model. We identify transitions between regimes with and without an apparent linear light cone for correlations, which correspond closely between the two models. For long-range interactions (in terms of separation distance r, decaying slower than 1/r), we find that despite the lack of a light-cone, correlations grow slowly as a power law at short times, and that -- depending on the structure of the initial state -- the growth of entanglement can also be sublinear. These results are understood through analytical calculations, and should be measurable in experiments with trapped ions.

abstract: The field of Quantum Chaos, addressing the quantum manifestations of an underlying classically chaotic dynamics, was developed in the early eighties, mainly from a theoretical perspective. Few experimental systems were initially recognized to exhibit the versatility of being sensitive, at the same time, to their classical and quantum dynamics. Rydberg atoms provided the main testing ground of Quantum Chaos concepts until the early nineties, marked by the development of microwave billiards, ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, and low-temperature transport in mesoscopic semiconductor structures. The mesoscopic regime is attained in small condensed matter systems at sufficiently low temperatures for the electrons to propagate coherently across the sample. The quantum coherence of electrons, together with the ballistic motion characteristic of ultra-clean microstructures, motivated the proposal of mesocopic systems as a very special laboratory for performing measurements and testing the theoretical ideas of Quantum Chaos. Experimental realizations and many important developments, reviewed in this article, followed from such a connection.

abstract: We study the dynamics of two gray solitons in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a toroidal trap with a tight confinement in the radial direction. Gross-Pitaevskii simulations show that solitons can be long living objects passing through many collisional processes. We have observed quite different behaviors depending on the soliton velocity. Very slow solitons, obtained by perturbing the stationary solitonic profile, move with a constant angular velocity until they collide elastically and move in the opposite direction without showing any sign of lowering their energy. In this case the density notches are always well separated and the fronts are sharp and straight. Faster solitons present vortices around the notches, which play a central role during the collisions. We have found that in these processes the solitons lose energy, as the outgoing velocity turns out to be larger than the incoming one. To study the dynamics, we model the gray soliton state with a free parameter that is related to the soliton velocity. We further analyze the energy, soliton velocity and turning points in terms of such a free parameter, finding that the main features are in accordance with the infinite one-dimensional system.

abstract: Using an extension of the H\"ormander product of distributions, we obtain an intrinsic formulation of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with singular potentials. This formulation is entirely defined in terms of standard {\it Schwartz} distributions and does not require (as some previous approaches) the use of more general distributions or generalized functions. We determine, in the new formulation, the action and domain of the Schr\"odinger operators with arbitrary singular boundary potentials. We also consider the inverse problem, and obtain a general procedure for constructing the singular (pseudo) potential that imposes a specific set of (local) boundary conditions. This procedure is used to determine the boundary operators for the complete four-parameter family of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with a point interaction. Finally, the $\delta$ and $\delta'$ potentials are studied in detail, and the corresponding Schr\"odinger operators are shown to coincide with the norm resolvent limit of specific sequences of Schr\"odinger operators with regular potentials.

abstract: We study how well functions over the boolean hypercube of the form $f_k(x)=(|x|-k)(|x|-k-1)$ can be approximated by sums of squares of low-degree polynomials, obtaining good bounds for the case of approximation in $\ell_{\infty}$-norm as well as in $\ell_1$-norm. We describe three complexity-theoretic applications: (1) a proof that the recent breakthrough lower bound of Lee, Raghavendra, and Steurer on the positive semidefinite extension complexity of the correlation and TSP polytopes cannot be improved further by showing better sum-of-squares degree lower bounds on $\ell_1$-approximation of $f_k$; (2) a proof that Grigoriev's lower bound on the degree of Positivstellensatz refutations for the knapsack problem is optimal, answering an open question from his work; (3) bounds on the query complexity of quantum algorithms whose expected output approximates such functions.

abstract: The aggressive scaling of silicon-based nanoelectronics has reached the regime where device function is affected not only by the presence of individual dopants, but more critically their position in the structure. The quantitative determination of the positions of subsurface dopant atoms is an important issue in a range of applications from channel doping in ultra-scaled transistors to quantum information processing, and hence poses a significant challenge. Here, we establish a metrology combining low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging and a comprehensive quantum treatment of the dopant-STM system to pin-point the exact lattice-site location of sub-surface dopants in silicon. The technique is underpinned by the observation that STM images of sub surface dopants typically contain many atomic-sized features in ordered patterns, which are highly sensitive to the details of the STM tip orbital and the absolute lattice-site position of the dopant atom itself. We demonstrate the technique on two types of dopant samples in silicon -- the first where phosphorus dopants are placed with high precision, and a second containing randomly placed arsenic dopants. Based on the quantitative agreement between STM measurements and multi-million-atom calculations, the precise lattice site of these dopants is determined, demonstrating that the metrology works to depths of about 36 lattice planes. The ability to uniquely determine the exact positions of sub-surface dopants down to depths of 5 nm will provide critical knowledge in the design and optimisation of nanoscale devices for both classical and quantum computing applications.

abstract: We present a conceptual approach to quantum tomography based on first expanding a quantum state across extra degrees of freedom and then exploiting the introduced sparsity to perform reconstruction. We formulate its application to photonic circuits, and show that measured spatial photon correlations at the output of a specially tailored discrete-continuous quantum-walk can enable full reconstruction of any two-photon spatially entangled and mixed state at the input. This approach does not require any tunable elements, so is well suited for integration with on-chip superconducting photon detectors.

abstract: We present a spectral analysis of Rydberg atoms in strong microwave fields using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) as an all-optical readout. The measured spectroscopic response enables optical, atom-based electric field measurements of high-power microwaves. In our experiments, microwaves are irradiated into a room-temperature rubidium vapor cell. The microwaves are tuned near the two-photon 65D-66D Rydberg transition and reach an electric field strength of 230V/m, about 20% of the microwave ionization threshold of these atoms. A Floquet treatment is used to model the Rydberg level energies and their excitation rates. We arrive at an empirical model for the field-strength distribution inside the spectroscopic cell that yields excellent overall agreement between the measured and calculated Rydberg EIT-Floquet spectra. Using spectral features in the Floquet maps we achieve an absolute strong-field measurement precision of 6%.

abstract: Atom interferometers provide exquisite measurements of the properties of non-inertial frames. While atomic interactions are typically detrimental to good sensing, efforts to harness entanglement to improve sensitivity remain tantalizing. Here we explore the role of interactions in an analogy between atomic gyroscopes and SQUIDs, motivated by recent experiments realizing ring shaped traps for ultracold atoms. We explore the one-dimensional limit of these ring systems with a moving weak barrier, such as that provided by a blue-detuned laser beam. In this limit, we employ Luttinger liquid theory and find an analogy with the superconducting phase-slip qubit, in which the topological charge associated with persistent currents can be put into superposition. In particular, we find that strongly-interacting atoms in such a system could be used for precision rotation sensing. We compare the performance of this new sensor to an equivalent non-interacting atom interferometer, and find improvements in sensitivity and bandwidth beyond the atomic shot-noise limit.

abstract: Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have been used to demonstrate quantum effects such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluity, and quantized vortices. However, in these experiments, the polaritons have not reached thermal equilibrium when they undergo the transition to a coherent state. This has prevented the verification of one of the canonical predictions for condensation, namely the phase diagram. In this work, we have created a polariton gas in a semiconductor microcavity in which the quasiparticles have a lifetime much longer than their thermalization time. This allows them to reach thermal equilibrium in a laser-generated confining trap. Their energy distributions are well fit by equilibrium Bose-Einstein distributions over a broad range of densities and temperatures from very low densities all the way up to the threshold for Bose-Einstein condensation. The good fits of the Bose-Einstein distribution over a broad range of density and temperature imply that the particles obey the predicted power law for the phase boundary of Bose-Einstein condensation.

abstract: We study a new effect of Cooper-pair-based two-photon gain in semiconductor-superconductor structures, showing broadband enhancement of ultrafast two-photon amplification. We further show that with the superconducting enhancement, at moderately high seed intensities the two-photon gain contribution approaches that of the one-photon gain. A full quantum-optical model of singly- and fully-stimulated two-photon emission is developed. Our results provide new insights on nonlinear light-matter interaction in the superconducting state, including the possibility of coherent control in two-photon semiconductor-superconductor devices. The theoretically demonstrated effects can have important implications in optoelectronics and in coherent control applications.

abstract: The phenomenon of many-body localised (MBL) systems has attracted significant interest in recent years, for its intriguing implications from a perspective of both condensed-matter and statistical physics: they are insulators even at non-zero temperature and fail to thermalise, violating expectations from quantum statistical mechanics. What is more, recent seminal experimental developments with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices constituting analog quantum simulators have pushed many-body localised systems into the realm of physical systems that can be measured with high accuracy. In this work, we introduce experimentally accessible witnesses that directly probe distinct features of MBL, distinguishing it from its Anderson counterpart. We insist on building our toolbox from techniques available in the laboratory, including on-site addressing, super-lattices, and time-of-flight measurements, identifying witnesses based on fluctuations, density-density correlators, densities, and entanglement. We build upon the theory of out of equilibrium quantum systems, in conjunction with tensor network and exact simulations, showing the effectiveness of the tools for realistic models.

The current operator satisfies the conditions of Lorentz-covariance and current conservation in MIA. The results of the calculations are compared with the analogous results in the light-front dynamics and in the model of vector meson dominance

abstract: In this paper we study a model of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator in a 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter background. We use a generalized Schr\"odinger picture in which the analogs of the Schr\"odinger operators of the particle are independent of both the time and the space coordinates in different representations. The spacetime independent operators of the particle induce the Lie algebra of Killing vector fields of the $AdS_3$ spacetime. In this picture, we have a metamorphosis of the Heisenberg's uncertainty relations.

abstract: Fundamental forces of Nature are described by field theories, also known as gauge theories, based on a local gauge invariance. The simplest of them is quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is an example of an Abelian gauge theory. Such theories describe the dynamics of massless photons and their coupling to matter. However, in two spatial dimension (2D) they are known to exhibit gapped phases at low temperature. In the realm of quantum spin systems, it remains a subject of considerable debate if their low energy physics can be described by emergent gauge degrees of freedom. Here we present a class of simple two-dimensional models that admit a low energy description in terms of an Abelian gauge theory. We find rich phase diagrams for these models comprising exotic deconfined phases and gapless phases - a rare example for 2D Abelian gauge theories. The counter-intuitive presence of gapless phases in 2D results from the emergence of additional symmetry in the models. Moreover, we propose schemes to realize our model with current experiments using ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices.

abstract: Quantum fluctuations are the origin of genuine quantum many-body effects, and can be neglected in classical mean-field phenomena. Here we report on the observation of stable quantum droplets containing $\sim$ 800 atoms which are expected to collapse at the mean-field level due to the essentially attractive interaction. By systematic measurements on individual droplets we demonstrate quantitatively that quantum fluctuations stabilize them against the mean-field collapse. We observe in addition interference of several droplets indicating that this stable many-body state is phase coherent.

abstract: Ultrahigh enhancement of Stokes Raman scattering in plasmonic hotspots can create a considerable number of molecular vibration phonons at low laser powers. We show that this effect results in and is manifested by a heterogeneous dependence of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering intensity on laser power. By quantization of the molecular vibration coherent state into phonon number states, and by incorporating different Raman activities for different Stokes transitions, we theoretically predict a heterogeneous multi-stage phonon pumping phenomenon for resonant Raman molecules, which includes a saturation stage and a stimulated phonon emission stage. Experimental results are presented to prove the theory, by measuring gold nanosphere-plane antennas under radially polarized excitation, with a monolayer of malachite green isothiocyanate molecules in the junction gap. The theory and experiment on heterogeneous quantum phonon pumping are fundamental to the understanding of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering and its photobleaching behavior.

Our motivation is the study of many-body localization. We investigate transport properties in terms of polynomial Lieb-Robinson (PLR) bounds. We prove a zero-velocity PLR bound for large disorder strength $\lambda$ and for small $\lambda$ we show a partial converse, which suggests the existence of non-trivial transport in the model.

abstract: Average block entanglement in the 1D XX-model with uncorrelated random couplings is known to grow as the logarithm of the block size, in similarity to conformal systems. In this work we study random spin chains whose couplings present long range correlations, generated as gaussian fields with a power-law spectral function. Ground states are always planar valence bond states, and their statistical ensembles are characterized in terms of their block entropy and their bond-length distribution, which follow power-laws. We conjecture the existence of a critical value for the spectral exponent, below which the system behavior is identical to the case of uncorrelated couplings. Above that critical value, the entanglement entropy violates the area law and grows as a power law of the block size, with an exponent which increases from zero to one. Similar planar bond structures are also found in statistical models of RNA folding and kinetic roughening, and we trace an analogy between them and quantum valence bond states. Using an inverse renormalization procedure we determine the optimal spin-chain couplings which give rise to a given planar bond structure, and study the statistical properties of the couplings whose bond structures mimic those found in RNA folding.

This study is relevant to the problem of robust quantum memory with long storage time and fast readout.

abstract: 852nm nano-second laser pulse chain with a high on/off ratio is generated via chopping a continuous-wave laser beam by using of a Mach-Zehnder-type electro-optic intensity modulator (MZ-EOIM). Detailed analysis and dependence of the on/off ratio on the splitting ratio, the co-splitting ratio, and the arms loss of MZ-EIOM are presented. By optimizing the polarization of incident laser beam and stabilizing MZ-EOIM temperature, the static on/off ratio of 12600:1 is achieved. Also the dynamic on/off ratios versus the pulse repetition rate and the pulse duty cycle are measured and discussed. This high on/off ratio ns pulsed laser system has served as the excitation pulse source for a triggered single-photon source based on trapped single cesium atom, which reveals a representative anti-bunching.

abstract: On the basis of general theoretical results developed previously in [JETP 112, 246 (2011)], we analyze the reflection of quasiresonant light from a plane surface of dense and disordered ensemble of motionless point scatters. Angle distribution of the scattered light is calculated both for s and p polarizations of the probe radiation. The ratio between coherent and incoherent (diffuse) components of scattered light is calculated. We analyze the contributions of scatters located at different distances from the surface and determine on this background the thickness of surface layer responsible for reflected beam generation. The inhomogeneity of dipole-dipole interaction near the surface is discussed.We study also dependence of total reflected light power on the incidence angle and compare the results of the microscopic approach with predictions of the Fresnel reflection theory. The calculations are performed for different densities of scatters and different frequencies of a probe radiation.

abstract: We investigate the quantum entanglement of systems of coupled harmonic oscillators on the basis of thermo-field dynamics (TFD). For coupled harmonic oscillators at equilibrium, the extended entanglement entropy is derived using the TFD method, and it is demonstrated to be controlled by temperature and coupling parameters. For non-equilibrium systems, in addition to temperature and coupling parameters, the time dependence of the extended entanglement entropy is calculated in accordance with the dissipative von Neumann equation, and the dissipative dynamics of the systems of coupled harmonic oscillators is discussed. Consequently, based on TFD, the physical parametrization of the entanglement entropies is confirmed in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases of harmonic oscillator systems by means of the laws of thermodynamics.

abstract: The energy-spectrum of two point-like particles interacting in a 3-D isotropic Harmonic Oscillator (H.O.) trap is related to the free scattering phase-shifts $\delta$ of the particles by a formula first published by Busch et al. It is here used to find an expression for the \it shift \rm of the energy levels, caused by the interaction, rather than the perturbed spectrum itself. In the limit of high energy (large quantum number $n$ of the H.O.) this shift is shown to be given by $-2\frac{\delta}{\pi}$, also valid in the limit of infinite as well as zero scattering length at all H.O. energies. Numerical investigation shows that the shifts differ from the exact result of Busch et al, by less than $<\frac{1}{2}\%$ except for $n=0$ when it can be as large as $\approx 2.5\%$. This approximation for the energy-shift is well known from another exactly solvable model, namely that of two particles interacting in a spherical infinite square-well trap (or box) of radius $R$ in the limit $R\rightarrow \infty$, and/or in the limit of large energy. It is in this context referred to as the \it phase-shift approximation \rm. It can be (and has been) used in (infinite) nuclear matter calculations to calculate the two-body effective interaction in situations where in-medium effects can be neglected. It has also been used in expressing the energy of free electrons in a metal.

abstract: We study the inflationary quantum-to-classical transition for the adiabatic curvature perturbation $\zeta$ due to quantum decoherence, focusing on the role played by squeezed-limit mode couplings. We evolve the quantum state $\Psi$ in the Schr\"odinger picture, for a generic cubic coupling to additional environment degrees of freedom. Focusing on the case of minimal gravitational interactions, we find the evolution of the reduced density matrix for a given long-wavelength fluctuation by tracing out the other (mostly shorterwavelength) modes of $\zeta$ as an environment. We show that inflation produces phase oscillations in the wave functional $\Psi[\zeta(\mathbf{x})]$, which suppress off-diagonal components of the reduced density matrix, leaving a diagonal mixture of different classical configurations. Gravitational nonlinearities thus provide a minimal mechanism for generating classical stochastic perturbations from inflation. We identify the time when decoherence occurs, which is delayed after horizon crossing due to the weak coupling, and find that Hubble-scale modes act as the decohering environment. We also comment on the observational relevance of decoherence and its relation to the squeezing of the quantum state.

abstract: A charged entanglement entropy is a new measure which probes quantum entanglement between different charge sectors. We study symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases in 2+1 dimensional space-time by using this charged entanglement entropy. SPT phases are short range entangled states without topological order and hence cannot be detected by the topological entanglement entropy. We demonstrate that the universal part of the charged entanglement entropy is non-zero for non-trivial SPT phases and therefore it is a useful measure to detect short range entangled topological phases. We also discuss that the classification of SPT phases based on the charged topological entanglement entropy is related to that of the braiding statistics of quasiparticles.

abstract: Certain tight binding lattices host macroscopically degenerate flat spectral bands. Their origin is rooted in local symmetries of the lattice, with destructive interference leading to the existence of compact localized eigenstates. A recent study of a particular one-dimensional lattice [EPL 105, 30001 (2014)] showed that weak diagonal disorder hybridizes compact eigenstates with dispersive bands, leading to Fano resonances, Cauchy-tailed effective disorder potentials, and a loss of single parameter scaling. Here we generalize to different classes of flat band lattices in one and two dimensions as well as off-diagonal disorder, revealing different scaling exponents for the Anderson localization length and confirming the broad applicability of the underlying Fano-Cauchy physics.

abstract: We investigate experimentally the supercurrent in a clean carbon nanotube quantum dot, close to orbital degeneracy, connected to superconducting leads in a regime of strong competition between local electronic correlations and superconducting proximity effect. For an odd occupancy of the dot and intermediate coupling to the reservoir, the Kondo effect can develop in the normal state and screen the local magnetic moment of the dot. This leads to singlet-doublet transitions that strongly affect the Josephson effect in a single-level quantum dot: the sign of the supercurrent changes from positive to negative (0 to $\pi$-junction). In the regime of strongest competition between the Kondo effect and proximity effect, meaning that the Kondo temperature equals the superconducting gap, the magnetic state of the dot undergoes a first order quantum transition induced by the superconducting phase difference across the junction. This is revealed experimentally by anharmonic current-phase relations. In addition, the very specific electronic configuration of clean carbon nanotubes, with two nearly orbitally degenerated states, leads to different physics depending whether only one or both quasi-degenerate upper levels of the dots participate to transport, which is determined by their occupancy and relative widths. When the transport of Cooper pairs takes place through only one of these levels, we find that the phase diagram of the phase-dependent 0-$\pi$ transition is a universal characteristic of a discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition at zero temperature. In the case were two levels participate to transport, the nanotube Josephson current exhibits a continuous 0-$\pi$ transition, independent of the superconducting phase, revealing a different physical mechanism of the transition.

abstract: The classic comparison theorem of quantum mechanics states that if two potentials are ordered then the corresponding energy eigenvalues are similarly ordered, that is to say if $V_a\le V_b$, then $E_a\le E_b$. Such theorems have recently been established for relativistic problems even though the discrete spectra are not easily characterized variationally. In this paper we improve on the basic comparison theorem for the Dirac equation with spin and pseudo--spin symmetry in $d\ge 1$ dimensions. The graphs of two comparison potentials may now cross each other in a prescribed manner implying that the energy values are still ordered. The refined comparison theorems are valid for the ground state in one dimension and for the bottom of an angular momentum subspace in $d>1$ dimensions. For instance in a simplest case in one dimension, the condition $V_a\le V_b$ is replaced by $U_a\le U_b$, where $U_i(x)=\int_0^x V_i(t)dt$, $x\in[0,\ \infty)$, and $i=a$ or $b$.

abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and transient dynamics of the (unbiased) Ohmic two-state system by exploiting the equivalence of this model to the interacting resonant level model. For the thermodynamics, we show, by using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method, how the universal specific heat and susceptibility curves evolve with increasing dissipation strength, $\alpha$, from those of an isolated two-level system at vanishingly small dissipation strength, with the characteristic activated-like behavior in this limit, to those of the isotropic Kondo model in the limit $\alpha\to 1^{-}$. For the transient dynamics of the two-level system, $P(t)=\langle \sigma_{z}(t)\rangle$, with initial-state preparation $P(t\leq0)=+1$, we apply the time-dependent extension of the NRG (TDNRG) to the interacting resonant level model, and compare the results obtained with those from the noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), the functional renormalization group (FRG), and the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG). We demonstrate excellent agreement on short to intermediate time scales between TDNRG and TD-DMRG for $0\lesssim\alpha \lesssim 0.9$ for $P(t)$, and between TDNRG and FRG in the vicinity of $\alpha=1/2$. Furthermore, we quantify the error in the NIBA for a range of $\alpha$, finding significant errors in the latter even for $0.1\leq \alpha\leq 0.4$. We also briefly discuss why the long-time errors in the present formulation of the TDNRG prevents an investigation of the crossover between coherent and incoherent dynamics. Our results for $P(t)$ at short to intermediate times could act as useful benchmarks for the development of new techniques to simulate the transient dynamics of spin-boson problems.

title: Minimization principle for non degenerate excited states (independent of orthogonality to lower lying known approximants)

abstract: The computation of small concise and comprehensible excited state wave functions is needed because many electronic processes occur in excited states. But since the excited energies are saddle points in the Hilbert space of wave functions, the standard computational methods, based on orthogonality to lower lying approximants, resort to huge and incomprehensible wave functions, otherwise, the truncated wave function is veered away from the exact. The presented variational principle for excited states, Fn, is demonstrated to lead to the correct excited eigenfunction in necessarily small truncated spaces. Using Hylleraas coordinates for He 1S 1s2s, the standard method based on the theorem of Hylleraas - Unheim, and MacDonald, yields misleading main orbitals 1s1s' and needs a series expansion of 27 terms to be corrected, whereas minimizing Fn goes directly to the corect main orbitals, 1s2s, and can be adequately improved by 8 terms. Fn uses crude, rather inaccurate, lower lying approximants and does not need orthogonality to them. This reduces significantly the computation cost. Thus, having a correct 1st excited state {\psi}1, a ground state approximant can be immediately improved toward an orthogonal to psi_1 function. Also higher lying functions can be found that have the energy of psi_1, but are orthogonal to psi_1. Fn can also recognize a flipped root in avoided crossings: The excited state, either flipped or not, has the smallest Fn. Thus, state average is unnecessary. The method is further applied via conventional configuration interaction to the three lowest singlet states of He 1S.

abstract: The question of gauge-covariance in the non-Abelian gauge-field formulation of two space-dimensional systems with spin-orbit coupling relevant to spintronics is investigated. Although, these are generally gauge-fixed models, it is found that for the class of gauge fields that are space-time independent and satisfy a U(1) algebra, thus having a vanishing field strength, there is a residual gauge freedom in the Hamiltonian. The gauge transformations assume the form of a space-dependent rotation of the transformed wave functions with rotation angles and axes determined by the specific form of the gauge-field, i.e., the spin-orbit coupling. The fields can be gauged away, reducing the Hamiltonian to one which is isospectral to the free-particle Hamiltonian, and giving rise to the phenomenon of persistent spin helix reported first by B.~A.~Bernevig \emph{et al.} [Phys.~Rev.~Lett. \textbf{97}, 236601 (2006)]. The investigation of the global gauge transformations leads to the derivation of a continuity equation where the component of the spin-density along given directions, again fixed by the specific form of the gauge field, is conserved.

abstract: In the present study, a series of planar poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) oligomers with n phenyl rings (n = 1 - 20), designated as n-PP, are taken as finite-size models of the narrowest armchair graphene nanoribbons with hydrogen passivation. The singlet-triplet energy gap, vertical ionization potential, vertical electron affinity, fundamental gap, optical gap, and exciton binding energy of n-PP are calculated using Kohn-Sham density functional theory and time-dependent density functional theory with various exchange-correlation density functionals. The ground state of n-PP is shown to be singlet for all the chain lengths studied. In contrast to the lowest singlet state (i.e., the ground state), the lowest triplet state and the ground states of the cation and anion of n-PP are found to exhibit some multi-reference character. Overall, the electronic and optical properties of n-PP obtained from the omegaB97 and omegaB97X functionals are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data.

abstract: The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is contributing important results and insights into archetypal many-body problems, including quantum phase transitions. Still, the question whether out-of-equilibrium quantities, such as fluctuations of work, exhibit critical scaling after a sudden quench in a closed system has remained elusive. Here, we take a novel approach to the problem by studying a quench across an impurity quantum critical point. By performing density matrix renormalization group computations on the two-impurity Kondo model, we are able to establish that the irreversible work produced in a quench exhibits finite-size scaling at quantum criticality. This scaling faithfully predicts the equilibrium critical exponents for the crossover length and the order parameter of the model, and, moreover, implies a new exponent for the rescaled irreversible work. By connecting the irreversible work to the two-impurity spin correlation function, our findings can be tested experimentally.

abstract: This paper presents a minimally-destructive imaging technique based on a combination of phase contrast and Faraday rotation imaging used to continuously observe a condensate of 85 Rb. We demonstrate that the technique is capable of imaging a small sample of only 10 4 atoms up to 100 times with negligible decreases in atom number and no observable heating. At approximately 1GHz detuning, the SNR remains at approximately 7 for all 100 images, with a 22ms TOF absorption image confirming the survival of the condensate. The splitting of the magnetic sublevels of this species at such fields show non-trivial selection rules. We present experimental data outlining particular allowed transitions in this regime.

abstract: Topological phases with large Chern numbers have important implications. They were previously predicted to exist by considering fabricated long-range interactions or multi-layered materials. Stimulated by recent wide interests in Floquet topological phases, here we propose a scheme to engineer large-Chern-number phases with ease by periodic quenching. Using a two-band system as an example, we theoretically show how a variety of topological phases with widely tunable Chern numbers can be generated by periodic quenching between two simple Hamiltonians that otherwise give low Chern numbers. The obtained large Chern numbers are explained through the emergence of multiple Dirac cones in the Floquet spectra. The transition lines between different topological phases in the two-band model are also explicitly found, thus establishing a class of easily solvable but very rich systems useful for further understandings and applications of topological phases in periodically driven systems.

abstract: In this paper we present new versions of previously published numerical programs for solving the dipolar Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation including the contact interaction in two and three spatial dimensions in imaginary and in real time, yielding both stationary and non-stationary solutions. New versions of programs were developed using CUDA toolkit and can make use of Nvidia GPU devices. The algorithm used is the same split-step semi-implicit Crank-Nicolson method as in the previous version (R. Kishor Kumar et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 195, 117 (2015)), which is here implemented as a series of CUDA kernels that compute the solution on the GPU. In addition, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) library used in the previous version is replaced by cuFFT library, which works on CUDA-enabled GPUs. We present speedup test results obtained using new versions of programs and demonstrate an average speedup of 12 to 25, depending on the program and input size.

abstract: We present hybrid OpenMP/MPI (Open Multi-Processing/Message Passing Interface) parallelized versions of earlier published C programs (D. Vudragovic et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 183, 2021 (2012)) for calculating both stationary and non-stationary solutions of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation in three spatial dimensions. The GP equation describes the properties of dilute Bose-Einstein condensates at ultra-cold temperatures. Hybrid versions of programs use the same algorithms as the C ones, involving real- and imaginary-time propagation based on a split-step Crank-Nicolson method, but consider only a fully-anisotropic three-dimensional GP equation, where algorithmic complexity for large grid sizes necessitates parallelization in order to reduce execution time and/or memory requirements per node. Since distributed memory approach is required to address the latter, we combine MPI programing paradigm with existing OpenMP codes, thus creating fully flexible parallelism within a combined distributed/shared memory model, suitable for different modern computer architectures. The two presented C/OpenMP/MPI programs for real- and imaginary-time propagation are optimized and accompanied by a customizable makefile. We present typical scalability results for the provided OpenMP/MPI codes and demonstrate almost linear speedup until inter-process communication time starts to dominate over calculation time per iteration. Such a scalability study is necessary for large grid sizes in order to determine optimal number of MPI nodes and OpenMP threads per node.

abstract: We first propose and study a quantum toy model of black hole dynamics. The model is unitary, displays quantum thermalization, and the Hamiltonian couples every oscillator with every other, a feature intended to emulate the color sector physics of large-$\mathcal{N}$ matrix models. Considering out of equilibrium initial states, we analytically compute the time evolution of every correlator of the theory and of the entanglement entropies, allowing a proper discussion of global thermalization/scrambling of information through the entire system. Microscopic non-locality causes factorization of reduced density matrices, and entanglement just depends on the time evolution of occupation densities. In the second part of the article, we show how the gained intuition extends to large-$\mathcal{N}$ matrix models, where we provide a gauge invariant entanglement entropy for `generalized free fields', again depending solely on the quasinormal frequencies. The results challenge the fast scrambling conjecture and point to a natural scenario for the emergence of the so-called brick wall or stretched horizon. Finally, peculiarities of these models in regards to the thermodynamic limit and the information paradox are highlighted.

Employing a Frenkel-exciton Hamiltonian with diagonal and off-diagonal disorder consistent with spectral and structural studies, we analyze excitonic localization and spectral statistics of the chlorosomes. A size-dependent localization-delocalization crossover is found to occur as a function of the excitonic energy. The crossover energy region coincides with the more optically active states with maximized superradiance, and is, consequently, more conducive for energy transfer.

Although both Dirac pairs are localized along the extended-defect core, their interactions are screened due to the trivial topological nature of the extended defect.

abstract: We investigate how the quantum dynamics of gravitational models depend on the clocks employed in quantization procedure. Our previous result demonstrates that almost all physical features of quantum cosmological bounces depend on the choice of clock. The vital question whether all the quantum (or, semiclassical) solutions admit, away from the quantum interaction region in the far past and future, invariant asymptotic limits irrespectively of the clock's choice is addressed herein. We analyze the semiclassical dynamics of the Bianchi Type I model undergoing a quantum bounce. Our result follows from the universal principle of the free choice of clock and thus, it applies to all quantum gravity models based on the concept of the physical Hilbert space and inner dynamics. Then we propose a suitable interpretation of quantum models of gravity. As a by-product of the pursuit of our main goal, we elaborate the semiclassical description of anisotropic singularity resolution.

abstract: We examine the rotational states of a pair of polar $^2\Sigma$ molecules subject to a uniform magnetic field. The electric dipole-dipole interaction between the molecules creates entangled pair-eigenstates of two types. In one type, the Zeeman interaction between the inherently paramagnetic molecules and the magnetic field destroys the entanglement of the pair-eigenstates, whereas in the other type it does not. The pair-eigenstates exhibit numerous intersections, which become avoided for pair-eigenstates comprised of individual states that meet the selection rules $\Delta J_{i}=0,\pm 1$, $\Delta N_{i}=0,\pm 2$, and $\Delta M_{i}=0,\pm 1$ imposed by the electric dipole-dipole operator. Here $J_{i}$, $N_{i}$ and $M_{i}$ are the total, rotational and projection angular momentum quantum numbers of molecules $i=1,2$ in the absence of the electric dipole-dipole interaction. We evaluate the mutual alignment of the pair-eigenstates and find it to be independent of the magnetic field, except for states that undergo avoided crossings, in which case the alignment of the interacting states is interchanged at the magnetic field corresponding to the crossing point. We present an analytic model which provides ready estimates of the pairwise alignment cosine that characterises the mutual alignment of the coupled rotors.

abstract: The categorical compositional distributional model of natural language provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of sentences, given grammatical structure and the meanings of its words. This approach has outperformed other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks. However, until recently it has lacked the crucial feature of lexical entailment -- as do other distributional models of meaning. In this paper we solve the problem of entailment for categorical compositional distributional semantics. Taking advantage of the abstract categorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the introduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical semantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation. The new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a novel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts. This graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate entailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our graded order. Our main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the sentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment. We describe the essential properties of graded entailment such as continuity, and provide a procedure for calculating entailment strength.

abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to simulate the many-body dynamical quantum Hall effect with ultra-cold bosonic atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice. We first show that the required model Hamiltonian of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain with an effective magnetic field and tunable parameters can be realized in this system. For dynamical response to ramping the external fields, the quantized plateaus emerge in the Berry curvature of the interacting atomic spin chain as a function of the effective spin-exchange interaction. The quantization of this response in the parameter space with the interaction-induced topological transition characterizes the many-body dynamical quantum Hall effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this phenomenon can be observed in practical cold-atom experiments with numerical simulations.

Bonchi, Sobocinski, and Zanasi (2014) have shown that, given a suitable distributive law, a pair of Hopf algebras forms two Frobenius algebras. Here we take the opposite approach, and show that interacting Frobenius algebras form Hopf algebras. We generalise (BSZ 2014) by including non-trivial dynamics of the underlying object---the so-called phase group---and investigate the effects of finite dimensionality of the underlying model. We recover the system of Bonchi et al as a subtheory in the prime power dimensional case, but the more general theory does not arise from a distributive law.

abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of a triatomic Rydberg molecule formed by a Rydberg atom and two neutral ground-state atoms. Taking into account the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interactions we perform electronic structure calculations and analyze the adiabatic electronic potentials evolving from the Rb$(n=35, l\ge 3)$ Rydberg degenerate manifold. We hereby focus on three different classes of geometries of the Rydberg molecules, including symmetric, asymmetric and planar configurations. The metamorphosis of these potential energy surfaces in the presence of an external electric field is explored.

abstract: We present and analyze a reservoir-engineering approach to stabilizing Fock states in a superconducting microwave cavity which does not require any microwave-frequency control drives. Instead, our system makes use of a Josephson junction biased by a dc voltage which is coupled both to a principle storage cavity and a second auxiliary cavity. Our analysis shows that Fock states can be stabilized with an extremely high fidelity. We also show how the same system can be used to prepare on-demand propagating Fock states, again without the use of microwave pulses.

abstract: We propose an approach to probe Higgs boson couplings to the building blocks of matter: the electron and the up and down quarks, with precision measurement of isotope shifts in atomic clock transitions. We show that the attractive Higgs force between nuclei and their bound electrons induces measurable non-linearities in a King plot of two isotope shifts. We present an experimental method which, given state-of-the-art accuracy in frequency comparison, competes with and potentially surpasses the Large Hadron Collider in bounding the Higgs-to-light-fermion couplings. Better knowledge of the latter is an important test of the Standard Model which could lead, besides the establishment of new physics above the weak scale, to an alternative understanding of the flavor puzzle.

abstract: We analyze the one dimensional scattering produced by all variations of the P\"oschl-Teller potential, i.e., potential well, low and high barriers. We show that the P\"oschl-Teller well and low barrier potentials have no resonance poles, but an infinite number of simple poles along the imaginary axis corresponding to bound and antibound states. A quite different situation arises on the P\"oschl-Teller high barrier potential, which shows an infinite number of resonance poles and no other singularities. We have obtained the explicit form of their associated Gamow states. We have also constructed ladder operators connecting wave functions for bound and antibound states as well as for resonance states. Finally, using wave functions of Gamow and antibound states in the factorization method, we construct some examples of supersymmetric partners of the P\"oschl-Teller Hamiltonian.

abstract: We review the design, theory, and applications of two dimensional periodic lattices hosting conical intersections in their energy-momentum spectrum. The best known example is the Dirac cone, where propagation is governed by an effective Dirac equation, with electron spin replaced by a "fermionic" half-integer pseudospin. However, in many systems such as metamaterials, modal symmetries result in the formation of higher order conical intersections with integer or "bosonic" pseudospin. The ability to engineer lattices with these qualitatively different singular dispersion relations opens up many applications, including superior slab lasers, generation of orbital angular momentum, zero-index metamaterials, and quantum simulation of exotic phases of relativistic matter.

abstract: Photosynthetic reaction centres are pigment-protein complexes that can transform photo-induced electronic excitations into stable charge separated states with near-unit quantum efficiency. Here we consider a theoretical photovoltaic device that places a single photosystem II reaction centre between electrodes to investigate how the mean photo-current and its fluctuations depend on the vibrational environment that assists energy and electron transfer. Our results indicate that selective coupling to well resolved vibrational modes does not necessarily offer an advantage in terms of power output but does lead to photo-currents with suppressed noise levels. The exciton manifold and the structured vibrations assisting electron transfer can also support the emergence of a phenomenon akin to dynamical channel blockade, whereby excitonic traps can impose competing routes for population transfer under steady state operation. Our results help characterizing the device-like functionality of these complexes for their potential integration into molecular-scale photovoltaics.

abstract: Through proving the correspondence principle of work distributions, recent work [C. Jarzynski, H. T. Quan, and S. Rahav, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031038 (2015)] gives some justification to the definition of quantum work via two point energy measurements in one-dimensional (1D) integrable systems. In a chaotic system, however, the correspondence principle of work distributions has not been explored so far. In this paper we numerically study the work distribution in a chaotic system, and examine the relationship between the quantum and the classical work. Our numerical results suggest that there exists the correspondence principle of work distributions in a chaotic system as well. Our investigation further justifies the definition of quantum work via two point energy measurements in a chaotic system.

abstract: We present experimental results in which the unexpected zero-two transition of a circuit composed of two inductively coupled transmons is observed. This transition shows an unusual magnetic flux dependence with a clear disappearance at zero magnetic flux. In a transmon qubit the symmetry of the wave functions prevents this transition to occur due to selection rule. In our circuit the Josephson effect introduces strong couplings between the two normal modes of the artificial atom. This leads to a coherent superposition of states from the two modes enabling such transitions to occur.

abstract: We report on the optical properties of single InAs/GaAs quantum dots emitting near the telecommunication O-band, probed via Coulomb blockade and non-resonant photoluminescence spectroscopy, in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields. We extract the physical properties of the electron and hole wavefunctions, including the confinement energies, interaction energies, wavefunction lengths, and $g$-factors. For excitons, we measure the permanent dipole moment, polarizability, diamagnetic coefficient, and Zeeman splitting. The carriers are determined to be in the strong confinement regime. Large range electric field tunability, up to 7 meV, is demonstrated for excitons. We observe a large reduction, up to one order of magnitude, in the diamagnetic coefficient when rotating the magnetic field from Faraday to Voigt geometry due to the unique dot morphology. The complete spectroscopic characterization of the fundamental properties of long-wavelength dot-in-a-well structures provides insight for the applicability of quantum technologies based on quantum dots emitting at telecom wavelengths.

abstract: In this note we prove a simple theorem in quantum information theory, which implies that bulk operators in the Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence can be reconstructed as CFT operators in a spatial subregion $A$, provided that they lie in its entanglement wedge. This is an improvement on existing reconstruction methods, which have at most succeeded in the smaller causal wedge. The proof is a combination of the recent work of Jafferis, Lewkowycz, Maldacena, and Suh on the quantum relative entropy of a CFT subregion with earlier ideas interpreting the correspondence as a quantum error correcting code.

abstract: We present a procedure for exactly diagonalizing finite-range quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians with arbitrary boundary conditions in one of D dimensions, and periodic in the remaining D-1. The key is a Hamiltonian-dependent separation of the bulk from the boundary. By combining information from the two, we identify a matrix function that completely characterizes the solutions, and allow to identify an indicator of bulk-boundary correspondence. As an illustration, we show how our method correctly describes the zero-energy Majorana modes of a time-reversal-invariant s-wave superconductor in a Josephson ring configuration, and predicts that a fractional 4 pi Josephson effect can only be observed in phases hosting an odd number of Majorana pairs.

abstract: We present a phenomenological model to consider the effect of shape symmetry breaking on the optical properties of self-assembled quantum dots. We compare between quantum dots with two-fold rotational and two reflections ($C_{2v}$) symmetry and quantum dots in which this symmetry is reduced by perturbation to one reflection only ($C_{s}$). We show that this symmetry reduction drastically affects the optical activity of the dark exciton. In symmetric quantum dots, one of the dark exciton eigenstate is totally dark and the other, due to heavy- and light-hole mixing, has a small dipole moment polarized along the symmetry axis (growth direction) of the quantum dot. In non-symmetric quantum dots, the two dark excitons' eigenstates are mixed with the bright excitons' eigenstates which have cross-linearly polarized perpendicular to the growth direction dipole moments. As a result of this mixing one of the dark exciton eigenstate is dark while the other one does have dipole moment which is linearly polarized normal to the growth direction, like the lower energy bright exciton eigenstate. Our model agrees well with recently obtained experimental data.

abstract: We experimentally investigate magnon-polaritons, arising in ferrimagnetic resonance experiments in a microwave cavity with a tuneable quality factor. To his end, we simultaneously measure the electrically detected spin pumping signal and microwave reflection (the ferrimagnetic resonance signal) of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) / platinum (Pt) bilayer in the microwave cavity. The coupling strength of the fundamental magnetic resonance mode and the cavity is determined from the microwave reflection data. All features of the magnetic resonance spectra predicted by first principle calculations and an input-output formalism agree with our experimental observations. By changing the decay rate of the cavity at constant magnon-photon coupling rate, we experimentally tune in and out of the strong coupling regime and successfully model the corresponding change of the spin pumping signal. Furthermore, we observe the coupling and spin pumping of several spin wave modes and provide a quantitative analysis of their coupling rates to the cavity.

abstract: We perform extensive benchmark comparisons of surface hopping dynamics with numerically exact calculations for the spin-boson model over a wide range of energetic and coupling parameters as well as temperature. We find that deviations from golden-rule scaling in the Marcus regime are generally small and depend sensitively on the energetic bias between electronic states. Fewest switched surface hopping (FSSH) is found to be surprisingly accurate over a large swath of parameter space. The inclusion of decoherence corrections via the augmented FSSH (A-FSSH) algorithm improves the accuracy of dynamical behavior compared to exact simulations, but the effects are generally not dramatic, at least for the case of an environment modeled with the commonly used Debye spectral density.

In the effective tight-binding models that can be simulated, we demonstrate that this technique allows for a local and time-dependent control over all system parameters, and additionally allows for single-site resolved detection of atomic populations. We demonstrate full control over site-to-site off-diagonal tunneling elements (amplitude and phase) and diagonal site-energies, through the observation of continuous-time quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and negative tunneling. These capabilities open up new prospects in the experimental study of disordered and topological systems.

abstract: Topological phases of matter are a potential platform for the storage and processing of quantum information with intrinsic error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and with the length scales of the system, such as the distance between quasiparticles. However, it is less well-understood how error rates depend on the speed with which non-Abelian quasiparticles are braided. In general, diabatic corrections to the holonomy or Berry's matrix vanish at least inversely with the length of time for the braid, with faster decay occurring as the time-dependence is made smoother. We show that such corrections will not affect quantum information encoded in topological degrees of freedom, unless they involve the creation of topologically nontrivial quasiparticles. Moreover, we show how measurements that detect unintentionally created quasiparticles can be used to control this source of error.

abstract: We present a simple experimental scheme, based on standard atom optics techniques, to design highly versatile model systems for the study of single particle quantum transport phenomena. The scheme is based on a discrete set of free-particle momentum states that are coupled via momentum-changing two-photon Bragg transitions, driven by pairs of interfering laser beams. In the effective lattice models that are accessible, this scheme allows for single-site detection, as well as site-resolved and dynamical control over all system parameters. We discuss two possible implementations, based on state-preserving Bragg transitions and on state-changing Raman transitions, which respectively allow for the study of nearly arbitrary single particle Abelian U(1) and non-Abelian U(2) lattice models.

The candidate events, if they exist, will originate from the transition of a $2p$ orbit electron to the ground state which is already occupied by two electrons. The present limit on the probability for PEP violation for electron is 4.7 $\times10^{-29}$ set by the VIP experiment. With upgraded detectors for high precision X-ray spectroscopy, the VIP-2 experiment will improve the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude.

We show that unlike classical solutions and upon choosing appropriate initial conditions, the expectation value of the scale factor never tends to the singular point which exhibits the singularity-free behavior of the solutions in the quantum domain.

abstract: It has been recently proposed that quantum black holes can be described as N-graviton Bose-Einstein condensates. In this picture the quantum properties of BHs "... can be understood in terms of the single number N". However, so far, the dynamical origin of the occupational number N has not been specified. This description is alternative to the usual one, where black holes are believed to be well described geometrically even at the quantum level. In this paper we pursue the former point of view and develop a non-geometrical dynamical model of quantum black holes (BHs). In our model the occupational number N is proportional to the principal quantum number n of a Planckian harmonic oscillator. The so-called "classicalization" corresponds to the large-n limit, where the Schwarzschild horizon is recovered.

abstract: Physicists use quantum models to describe the behavior of physical systems. Quantum models owe their success to their interpretability, to their relation to probabilistic models (quantization of classical models) and to their high predictive power. Beyond physics, these properties are valuable in general data science. This motivates the use of quantum models to analyze general nonphysical datasets. Here we provide both empirical and theoretical insights into the application of quantum models in data science. In the theoretical part of this paper, we firstly show that quantum models can be exponentially more efficient than probabilistic models because there exist datasets that admit low-dimensional quantum models and only exponentially high-dimensional probabilistic models. Secondly, we explain in what sense quantum models realize a useful relaxation of compressed probabilistic models. Thirdly, we show that sparse datasets admit low-dimensional quantum models and finally, we introduce a method to compute hierarchical orderings of properties of users (e.g., personality traits) and items (e.g., genres of movies). In the empirical part of the paper, we evaluate quantum models in item recommendation and observe that the predictive power of quantum-inspired recommender systems can compete with state-of-the-art recommender systems like SVD++ and PureSVD. Furthermore, we make use of the interpretability of quantum models by computing hierarchical orderings of properties of users and items. This work establishes a connection between data science (item recommendation), information theory (communication complexity), mathematical programming (positive semidefinite factorizations) and physics (quantum models).

abstract: What is the maximum rate at which we can send information over a channel? We define the capacity of a channel as the answer to this question. For an important family of channels the capacity is given by a simple optimization problem as proven in Shannon's noisy coding theorem. Furthermore, for these channels, we have the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm that allows to efficiently solve the optimization problem and compute the capacity. In groundbreaking work, Verdu and Han proved a coding theorem for general channels. However, despite considerable effort, there is no equivalent to the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for computing the generalized capacity. Here, we show that such an algorithm can not exist.

abstract: In this letter, we calculate the probability for resonantly induced transitions in quantum states due to time dependent gravitational perturbations. Contrary to common wisdom, the probability of inducing transitions is not infinitesimally small. We consider a system of ultra cold neutrons (UCN), which are organized according to the energy levels of the Schr\"odinger equation in the presence of the earth's gravitational field. Transitions between energy levels are induced by an oscillating driving force of frequency $\omega$. The driving force is created by oscillating a macroscopic mass in the neighbourhood of the system of neutrons. The neutrons decay in 880 seconds while the probability of transitions increase as $t^2$. Hence the optimal strategy is to drive the system for 2 lifetimes. The transition amplitude then is of the order of $1.06\times 10^{-5}$ hence with a million ultra cold neutrons, one should be able to observe transitions.

In order to illustrate this kind of applications, we present two exactly solvable finite oscillators.

abstract: Theories of natural language and concepts have been unable to model the flexibility, creativity, context-dependence, and emergence, exhibited by words, concepts and their combinations. The mathematical formalism of quantum theory has instead been successful in capturing these phenomena such as graded membership, situational meaning, composition of categories, and also more complex decision making situations, which cannot be modeled in traditional probabilistic approaches. We show how a formal quantum approach to concepts and their combinations can provide a powerful extension of prototype theory. We explain how prototypes can interfere in conceptual combinations as a consequence of their contextual interactions, and provide an illustration of this using an intuitive wave-like diagram. This quantum-conceptual approach gives new life to original prototype theory, without however making it a privileged concept theory, as we explain at the end of our paper.

abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of measuring similarity among graphs that represent real objects with noisy data. To account for noise, we relax the definition of similarity using the maximum weighted co-$k$-plex relaxation method, which allows dissimilarities among graphs up to a predetermined level. We then formulate the problem as a novel quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem that can be solved by a quantum annealer. The context of our study is molecular similarity where the presence of noise might be due to regular errors in measuring molecular features. We develop a similarity measure and use it to predict the mutagenicity of a molecule. Our results indicate that the relaxed similarity measure, designed to accommodate the regular errors, yields a higher prediction accuracy than the measure that ignores the noise.

abstract: Trapping ions in Paul traps requires high radio-frequency voltages, which are generated using resonators. When operating traps in a cryogenic environment, an in-vacuum resonator showing low loss is crucial to limit the thermal load to the cryostat. In this study, we present a guide for the design and production of compact, shielded cryogenic resonators. We produced and characterized three different types of resonators and furthermore demonstrate efficient impedance matching of these resonators at cryogenic temperatures.

abstract: Placing a nanomechanical object in the evanescent near-field of a high-$Q$ optical microcavity gives access to strong gradient forces and quantum-noise-limited displacement readout, offering an attractive platform for precision sensing technology and basic quantum optics research. Robustly implementing this platform is challenging, however, as it requires separating optically smooth surfaces by $\lesssim\lambda/10$. Here we describe a fully-integrated evanescent opto-nanomechanical transducer based on a high-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam monolithically suspended above a SiO$_2$ microdisk cavity. Employing a novel vertical integration technique based on planarized sacrificial layers, we achieve beam-disk gaps as little as 25 nm while maintaining mechanical $Q\times f>10^{12}$ Hz and intrinsic optical $Q\sim10^7$. The combined low loss, small gap, and parallel-plane geometry result in exceptionally efficient transduction, characterizing by radio-frequency flexural modes with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates of 100 kHz, single-photon cooperativities in excess of unity, and zero-point frequency (displacement) noise amplitudes of 10 kHz (fm)/$\surd$Hz. In conjunction with the high power handling capacity of SiO$_2$ and low extraneous substrate noise, the transducer operates particularly well as a sensor. Deploying it in a 4 K cryostat, we recently demonstrated a displacement imprecision 40 dB below that at the standard quantum limit (SQL) with an imprecision-back-action product $<5\cdot\hbar$. In this report we provide a comprehensive description of device design, fabrication, and characterization, with an emphasis on extending Heisenberg-limited readout to room temperature. Towards this end, we describe a room temperature experiment in which a displacement imprecision 30 dB below that at the SQL and an imprecision-back-action product $<75\cdot\hbar$ is achieved.

abstract: Hawking radiation has been regarded as a more general phenomenon than in gravitational physics, in particular in laboratory analogues of the event horizon. Here we consider the fiber-optical analogue of the event horizon where intense light pulses in fibers establish horizons for probe light, and calculate the Hawking spectrum in an experimentally realizable system. We found that the Hawking radiation is peaked around group-velocity horizons where the speed of the pulse matches the group velocity of the probe light. The radiation nearly vanishes at the phase horizon where the speed of the pulse matches the phase velocity of light.

abstract: We argue that Hartle-Hawking states in the Regge quantum gravity model generically contain non-trivial entanglement between gravity and matter fields. Generic impossibility to talk about "matter in a point of space" is in line with the idea of an emergent spacetime, and as such could be taken as a possible candidate for a criterion for a plausible theory of quantum gravity. Finally, this new entanglement could be seen as an additional "effective interaction", which could possibly bring corrections to the weak equivalence principle.

abstract: The recent progress in integrated quantum optics has set the stage for the development of an integrated platform for quantum information processing with photons, with potential applications in quantum simulation. Among the different material platforms being investigated, direct-bandgap semiconductors and particularly gallium arsenide (GaAs) offer the widest range of functionalities, including single- and entangled-photon generation by radiative recombination, low-loss routing, electro-optic modulation and single-photon detection. This paper reviews the recent progress in the development of the key building blocks for GaAs quantum photonics and the perspectives for their full integration in a fully-functional and densely integrated quantum photonic circuit.

abstract: Given a system with a finite heat capacity and a heat reservoir, and two values of initial temperatures, $T_+$ and $T_- (< T_+)$, we enquire, in which case the optimal work extraction is larger: when the reservoir is an infinite source at $T_+$ and the system is a sink at $T_-$, or, when the reservoir is an infinite sink at $T_-$ and the system acts as a source at $T_+$? For an entropy-conserving process, the inequality between a generalized mean based on the mean value theorem, and arithmetic (geometric) mean of $T_+$ and $T_-$ decides the relative magnitude of work (efficiency) in the above mentioned two cases. This leads to consideration of three regions, in each of which the efficiency at maximum work obeys certain universal bounds, given only in terms of the ratio of initial temperatures. An interpretation for the generalized mean in terms of an effective temperature of a heat reservoir is found. The conclusions may serve as benchmarks in the design of heat engines, where we can choose the nature of the finite system, so as to tune the extractable work and/or efficiency at maximum work.

abstract: As PT and CP symmetries are fundamental in physics, we establish a unified topological theory of PT and CP invariant metals and nodal superconductors, based on the mathematically rigorous $KO$ theory. Representative models are constructed for all nontrivial topological cases in dimensions $d=1,2$, and $3$, with their exotic physical meanings being elucidated in detail. It is found that the topological charges of Fermi surfaces in the bulk determine the distribution of topological subgap modes on the boundaries depending on their directions. Furthermore, by constructing an exact bulk-boundary correspondence, we show that the topological Fermi points of the present PT and CP invariant classes can appear as gapless modes on the boundary of topological insulators with a certain type of anisotropic crystalline symmetry.

abstract: We propose and theoretically study a scheme for projectively reading out the parity state of a pair of Majorana bound states (MBS) using a tunnel coupled quantum dot. The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from any reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement. The combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge transfer between the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling. Resonance is controlled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS splitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter splitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite value by bringing the spatially separated MBS together via a set of keyboard gates. Simulations show that the oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to readout, but requires nanoscale precision in the control of the MBS spatial position. With experimentally realistic parameters and fast (sub-ns) control of the dot gate voltage, we find that parity readout fidelities >99% are possible if the MBS position is controllable within ~1 nm. Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus separation would present a clear signature of the MBS. We show how the scheme can be extended to distinguish valid parity measurements from invalid ones due to calibration errors.

abstract: A d-orbital electron has an anisotropic electron orbital and is a source of magnetism. The realization of a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) embedded at a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface surprised researchers in materials and physical sciences because the 2DEG consists of 3d-electrons of Ti with extraordinarily large carrier mobility, even in the insulating oxide heterostructure. To date, a wide variety of physical phenomena, such as ferromagnetism and the quantum Hall effect, have been discovered in this 2DEG systems, demonstrating the ability of the d-electron 2DEG systems to provide a material platform for the study of interesting physics. However, because of both ferromagnetism and the Rashba field, long-range spin transport and the exploitation of spintronics functions have been believed difficult to implement in the d-electron 2DEG systems. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of room-temperature spin transport in the d-electron-based 2DEG at a LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, where the spin relaxation length is ca. exceeding 200 nm. Our finding, which counters the conventional understandings to d-electron 2DEGs, opens a new field of d-electron spintronics. Furthermore, this work highlights a novel spin function in the conductive oxide system.

abstract: We report distinct nonanalytic signatures in the spin-orbit entanglement of a 2D electron gas with Rashba interactions at integer values of the filling factor and at certain level crossings. The accompanying sharp changes in the bulk spin-orbit entanglement entropy can be probed by measuring the fluctuation in the spin polarization of the electron gas.

abstract: Recently a new type of Feshbach resonance, i.e., orbital Feshbach resonance (OFR) was proposed for the ultracold alkali-earth (like) atoms, and experimentally observed in the ultracold gases of $^{{\rm 173}}$Yb atoms. Unlike most of the magnetic Feshbach resonances of ultracold alkali atoms, when the OFR of $^{{\rm 173}}$Yb atoms appears, the energy gap between the thresholds of the open channel (OC) and the closed channel (CC) is much smaller than the characteristic energy of the inter-atomic interaction, i.e., the van der Waals energy. In this paper we study the OFR in the systems with small CC-OC threshold gap. We show that in these systems the OFR can be induced by the coupling between the OC and either an isolated bound state of the CC or the scattering states of the CC. Moreover, we also show that in each case the two-channel Huang-Yang pesudopoential is always applicable for the approximate calculation of the low-energy scattering amplitude. Our results imply that in the theoretical calculations for these systems it is appropriate to take into account the contributions from the scattering states of the CC.

abstract: We establish a criterion for characterizing superfluidity in interacting, particle-number conserving systems of fermions as topologically trivial or non-trivial. Because our criterion is based on the concept of many-body fermionic parity switches, it is directly associated to the observation of the fractional Josephson effect and indicates the emergence of zero-energy modes that anticommute with fermionic parity. We tested these ideas on the Richardson-Gaudin-Kitaev chain, a particle-number conserving system that is solvable by way of the algebraic Bethe ansatz, and reduces to a long-range Kitaev chain in the mean-field approximation. Guided by its closed-form solution, we introduce a procedure for constructing many-body Majorana zero-energy modes of gapped topological superfluids in terms of coherent superpositions of states with different number of fermions. We discuss their significance and the physical conditions required to enable quantum control in the light of superselection rules.

abstract: We present an approach to computing probabilities in quantum field theory for a wide class of source-detector models. The approach works directly with probabilities and not with squared matrix elements, and the resulting probabilities can be written in terms of expectation values of nested commutators and anti-commutators. We present results that help in the evaluation of these, including an expression for the vacuum expectation values of general nestings of commutators and anti-commutators in scalar field theory. This approach allows one to see clearly how faster-than-light signalling is prevented, because it leads to a diagrammatic expansion in which the retarded propagator plays a prominent role. We illustrate the formalism using the simple case of the much-studied Fermi two-atom problem.

abstract: We demonstrate coherent dynamics of quantized magnetic fluxes in a superconducting loop with a weak link - a nanobridge patterned from the same thin NbN film as the loop. The bridge is a short rounded shape constriction, close to 10 nm long and 20 - 30 nm wide, having minimal width at its center. Quantum state control and coherent oscillations in the driven time evolution of the tunnel-junctionless system are achieved. Decoherence and energy relaxation in the system are studied using a combination of microwave spectroscopy and direct time-domain techniques. The effective flux noise behavior suggests inductance fluctuations as a possible cause of the decoherence.
