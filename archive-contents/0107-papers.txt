abstract: We propose a fibre bundle formulation of the mathematical base of relativistic quantum mechanics. At the present stage the bundle form of the theory is equivalent to its conventional one, but it admits new types of generalizations in different directions. In the present, second, part of our investigation, we consider a covariant approach to bundle description of relativistic quantum mechanics. In it the wavefunctions are replaced with (state) sections of a suitably chosen vector bundle over space-time whose (standard) fibre is the space of the wavefunctions. Now the quantum evolution is described as a linear transportation (by means of the transport along the identity map of the space\nobreakdash-time) of the state sections in the (total) bundle space. Connections between the (retarded) Green functions of the relativistic wave equations and the evolution operators and transports are found. Especially the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations are considered.

abstract: Epistemic interpretations of quantum mechanics fail to address the puzzle posed by the occurrence of probabilities in a fundamental physical theory. This is a puzzle about the physical world, not a puzzle about our relation to the physical world. Its solution requires a new concept of physical space, presented in this article. An examination of how the mind and the brain construct the phenomenal world reveals the psychological and neurobiological reasons why we think about space in ways that are inadequate to the physical world. The resulting notion that space is an intrinsically partitioned expanse has up to now stood in the way of a consistent ontological interpretation.

abstract: We investigate the geometric phases and the Bargmann invariants associated with a multi-level quantum systems. In particular, we show that a full set of `gauge-invariant' objects for an $n$-level system consists of $n$ geometric phases and ${1/2}(n-1)(n-2)$ algebraically independent 4-vertex Bargmann invariants. In the process of establishing this result we develop a canonical form for U(n) matrices which is useful in its own right. We show that the recently discovered `off-diagonal' geometric phases [N. Manini and F. Pistolesi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 8, 3067 (2000)] can be completely analysed in terms of the basic building blocks developed in this work. This result liberates the off-diagonal phases from the assumption of adiabaticity used in arriving at them.

abstract: The temporal evolutions of coherent resonances corresponding to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and absorption (EIA) were observed in a Hanle absorption experiment carried on the $D_{2}$ lines of $% ^{87}$Rb vapor by suddenly turning the magnetic field on or off. The main features of the experimental observations are well reproduced by a theoretical model based on Bloch equation where the atomic level degeneracy has been fully accounted for. Similar (opposite phase) evolutions were observed at low optical field intensities for Hanle/EIT or Hanle/EIA resonances. Unlike the Hanle/EIA\ transients which are increasingly shorter for driving field intensities approaching saturation, the $B\neq 0$ transient of the Hanle/EIT signal at large driving field intensities present a long decay time approaching the atomic transit time. Such counterintuitive behavior is interpreted as a consequence of the Zeno effect.

abstract: The nonclassical effect of photon anti-bunching is observed in the mixed field of a narrow band two-photon source and a coherent field under certain condition. A variety of different features in photon statistics are found to be the consequence of a two-photon interference effect with dependence on the relative phase of the fields. Besides the anti-bunching effect, we find another one of the features to be also nonclassical. These features emphasize the importance of quantum entanglement.

abstract: A recently proposed master equation in the Lindblad form is studied with respect to covariance properties and existence of a stationary solution. The master equation describes the interaction of a test particle with a quantum fluid, the so-called Rayleigh gas, and is characterized by the appearance of a two-point correlation function known as dynamic structure factor, which reflects symmetry and statistical mechanics properties of the fluid. In the case of a free gas all relevant physical parameters, such as fugacity, ratio between the masses, momentum transfer and energy transfer are put into evidence, giving an exact expansion of the dynamic structure factor. The limit in which these quantities are small is then considered. In particular in the Brownian limit a Fokker-Planck equation is obtained in which the corrections due to quantum statistics can be explicitly evaluated and are given in terms of the Bose function $g_0 (z)$ and the Fermi function $f_0 (z)$.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107011
abstract: The formalism of quantum mechanics produces spectacular results, but its rules, its parameters are empirical, either deduced from classical physics, or from experimental results rather than from the postulates. Thus, quantum mechanics is purely phenomenological; for instance, the computation of the eigenvalues of the energy is generally a simple interpolation in the discrete space of the quantum numbers. The attempts to show that quantum electrodynamics is more precise than classical electrodynamics are based on wrong computations. The lack of paradoxes in the classical theory, the appearance of classical, true interpretations of the wave-particle duality justify the criticism of Ehrenfest and Einstein. The obscurity of the quantum concepts leads to wrong conclusions that handicap the development of physics. Just as building a laser was considered absurd before the first maser worked, the concept of photon leads to deny a type of coherent Raman scattering necessary to understand some redshifts of spectra in astrophysics, and able to destroy the two fundamental proofs to the expansion of the universe.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107013
abstract: We present a general phase matching condition for the quantum search algorithm with arbitrary unitary transformation and arbitrary phase rotations. We show by an explicit expression that the phase matching condition depends both on the unitary transformation U and the initial state. Assuming that the initial amplitude distribution is an arbitrary superposition sin\theta_0 |1> + cos\theta_0 e^{i\delta} |2> with |1> = {1 / sin\beta} \sum_k |\tau_k> <\tau_k|U|0> and |2> = {1 / cos\beta} \sum_{i \ne \tau}|i> <i|U|0>, where |\tau_k> is a marked state and \sin\beta = \sqrt{\sum_k|U_{\tau_k 0}|^2} is determined by the matrix elements of unitary transformation U between |\tau_k> and the |0> state, then the general phase matching condition is tan{\theta / 2} [cos 2\beta + tan\theta_0 cos\delta sin 2\beta]= tan{\phi / 2} [1-tan\theta_0 sin\delta sin 2\beta tan{\theta / 2}], where \theta and \phi are the phase rotation angles for |0> and |\tau_k>, respectively. This generalizes previous conclusions in which the dependence of phase matching condition on $U$ and the initial state has been disguised. We show that several phase conditions previously discussed in the literature are special cases of this general one, which clarifies the question of which condition should be regarded as exact.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We discuss the discriminating power of separability criteria, which are based on the spectrum of a quantum state and its reductions. Common examples are entropic inequalities utilizing conditional Tsallis or Renyi entropies. We prove that these inequalities are implied by the reduction criterion for any positive value of the entropic parameters. We show however, that arbitrary sets of criteria based on spectral and local information can never be sufficient by establishing a separable, isospectral and locally undistinguishable counterpart for any Werner state in odd dimensions. For the case of two qubit systems we show that a simple controlled phase gate operation can produce an isospectral, entangled state out of a separable one, which has the same reductions.

abstract: The adiabatic theorem has been recently used to design quantum algorithms of a new kind, where the quantum computer evolves slowly enough so that it remains near its instantaneous ground state which tends to the solution [Farhi et al., quant-ph/0001106]. We apply this time-dependent Hamiltonian approach to the Grover's problem, i. e., searching a marked item in an unstructured database. We find that, by adjusting the evolution rate of the Hamiltonian so as to keep the evolution adiabatic on each infinitesimal time interval, the total running time is of order $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of items in the database. We thus recover the advantage of Grover's standard algorithm as compared to a classical search, scaling as $N$. This is in contrast with the constant-rate adiabatic approach developed by Farhi et al., where the requirement of adiabaticity is expressed only globally, resulting in a time of order $N$.

abstract: Two pure states of a multi-partite system are alway are related by a unitary transformation acting on the Hilbert space of the whole system. This transformation involves multi-partite transformations. On the other hand some quantum information protocols such as the quantum teleportation and quantum dense coding are based on equivalence of some classes of states of bi-partite systems under the action of local (one-particle) unitary operations. In this paper we address the question: ``Under what conditions are the two states states, $\varrho$ and $\sigma$, of a multi-partite system locally unitary equivalent?'' We present a set of conditions which have to be satisfied in order that the two states are locally unitary equivalent. In addition, we study whether it is possible to prepare a state of a multi-qudit system. which is divided into two parts A and B, by unitary operations acting only on the systems A and B, separately.

The protocol and the security proof take into account the effects concerning the finite size of the generated key.

Horodecki, {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\it 59} (1999) 1799]. We show that there are operators $\hat A$, both diagonal and non diagonal in the Bell basis, such that when the expectation value $<\hat A>$ is taken as prior information the problem of fake entanglement is not solved by adding a new constraint associated with the mean value of $\hat A^2$ (unlike what happens when the partial information is given by the expectation value of a Bell operator). The fake entanglement generated by the maximum entropy principle is also studied quantitatively by comparing the entanglement of formation of the inferred state with that of the original one.

We show that charged particles moving faster than light through the v a c u u m emit Cherenkov radiation. How can a particle move faster than light? The w e a k speed of a charged particle can exceed the speed of light. By definition, the weak velocity is <b|v|a>/<b|a> where v is the velocity operator and |a> and |b> are, respectively, the states of a particle before and after a velocity measurement. We discuss the consistency of weak values and show that superluminal weak speed is consistent with relativistic causality.

abstract: The first step in quantum information theory is the identification of entanglement as a valuable resource. The next step is learning how to exploit this resource efficiently. We learn how to exploit entanglement efficiently by applying analogues of thermodynamical concepts. These concepts include reversibility, entropy, and the distinction between intensive and extensive quantities. We discuss some of these analogues and show how they lead to a measure of entanglement for pure states. We also ask whether these analogues are more than analogues, and note that, l o c a l l y, entropy of entanglement is thermodynamical entropy.

abstract: Highly degenerate chaotic radiation has a Gaussian density matrix and a large occupation number of modes $f $. If it is passed through a weakly transmitting barrier, its counting statistics is close to Poissonian. We show that a second identical barrier, in series with the first, drastically modifies the statistics. The variance of the photocount is increased above the mean by a factor $f$ times a numerical coefficient. The photocount distribution reaches a limiting form with a Gaussian body and highly asymmetric tails. These are general consequences of the combination of weak transmission and multiple scattering.

abstract: Using optical dipole forces we have realized controlled transport of a single or any desired small number of neutral atoms over a distance of a centimeter with sub-micrometer precision. A standing wave dipole trap is loaded with a prescribed number of cesium atoms from a magneto-optical trap. Mutual detuning of the counter-propagating laser beams moves the interference pattern, allowing us to accelerate and stop the atoms at preselected points along the standing wave. The transportation efficiency is close to 100%. This optical "single-atom conveyor belt" represents a versatile tool for future experiments requiring deterministic delivery of a prescribed number of atoms on demand.

abstract: Since the work of Anderson on localization, interference effects for the propagation of a wave in the presence of disorder have been extensively studied, as exemplified in coherent backscattering (CBS) of light. In the multiple scattering of light by a disordered sample of thermal atoms, interference effects are usually washed out by the fast atomic motion. This is no longer true for cold atoms where CBS has recently been observed. However, the internal structure of the atoms strongly influences the interference properties. In this paper, we consider light scattering by an atomic dipole transition with arbitrary degeneracy and study its impact on coherent backscattering. We show that the interference contrast is strongly reduced. Assuming a uniform statistical distribution over internal degrees of freedom, we compute analytically the single and double scattering contributions to the intensity in the weak localization regime. The so-called ladder and crossed diagrams are generalized to the case of atoms and permit to calculate enhancement factors and backscattering intensity profiles for polarized light and any closed atomic dipole transition.

Quantum mechanics predicts a gross violation (up to a factor of 2) of the noncontextual Bell-like inequality associated with the proposed experiment. An actual maximal violation of this inequality would demonstrate (modulo fair sampling) an all-or-nothing type contradiction between QM and NCHV.

abstract: We consider several observers who monitor different parts of the environment of a single quantum system and use their data to deduce its state. We derive a set of conditional stochastic master equations that describe the evolution of the density matrices each observer ascribes to the system under the Markov approximation, and show that this problem can be reduced to the case of a single "super-observer", who has access to all the acquired data. The key problem - consistency of the sets of data acquired by different observers - is then reduced to the probability that a given combination of data sets will be ever detected by the "super-observer". The resulting conditional master equations are applied to several physical examples: homodyne detection of phonons in quantum Brownian motion, photo-detection and homodyne detection of resonance fluorescence from a two-level atom. We introduce {\it relative purity} to quantify the correlations between the information about the system gathered by different observers from their measurements of the environment. We find that observers gain the most information about the state of the system and they agree the most about it when they measure the environment observables with eigenstates most closely correlated with the optimally predictable {\it pointer basis} of the system.

abstract: We consider the simulation of the dynamics of one nonlocal Hamiltonian by another, allowing arbitrary local resources but no entanglement nor classical communication. We characterize notions of simulation, and proceed to focus on deterministic simulation involving one copy of the system. More specifically, two otherwise isolated systems $A$ and $B$ interact by a nonlocal Hamiltonian $H \neq H_A+H_B$. We consider the achievable space of Hamiltonians $H'$ such that the evolution $e^{-iH't}$ can be simulated by the interaction $H$ interspersed with local operations. For any dimensions of $A$ and $B$, and any nonlocal Hamiltonians $H$ and $H'$, there exists a scale factor $s$ such that for all times $t$ the evolution $e^{-iH'st}$ can be simulated by $H$ acting for time $t$ interspersed with local operations. For 2-qubit Hamiltonians $H$ and $H'$, we calculate the optimal $s$ and give protocols achieving it. The optimal protocols do not require local ancillas, and can be understood geometrically in terms of a polyhedron defined by a partial order on the set of 2-qubit Hamiltonians.

abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm which uses the number of qubits in an optimal way and efficiently simulates a physical model with rich and complex dynamics described by the quantum sawtooth map. The numerical study of the effect of static imperfections in the quantum computer hardware shows that the main elements of the phase space structures are accurately reproduced up to a time scale which is polynomial in the number of qubits. The errors generated by these imperfections are more dangerous than the errors of random noise in gate operations.

abstract: Isham's topos-theoretic perspective on the logic of the consistent-histories theory is extended in two ways. First, the presheaves of consistent sets of history propositions in the topos proposed by Isham are endowed with a Vietoris-type of topology and subsequently they are sheafified with respect to it. The category resulting from this sheafification procedure is the topos of sheaves of sets varying continuously over the Vietoris-topologized base poset category of Boolean subalgebras of the universal orthoalgebra of quantum history propositions. The second extension of Isham's topos consists in endowing the stalks of the aforementioned sheaves, which were originally inhabited by structureless sets, with further algebraic structure, that also enjoys a quantum causal interpretation, so as to arrive at the topos of consistent-histories of quantum causal sets. The resulting quantum causal histories topos is compared with Markopoulou's quantum causal histories, with Mallios and this author's finitary spacetime sheaves of quantum causal sets, as well as with Butterfield and Isham's topos perspective on the Kochen-Specker theorem of quantum logic.

abstract: The perturbation theory is developed based on small parameters which naturally appear in solid state quantum computation. We report the simulations of the dynamics of quantum logic operations with a large number of qubits (up to 1000). A nuclear spin chain is considered in which selective excitations of spins are provided by having a uniform gradient of the external magnetic field. Quantum logic operations are utilized by applying resonant electromagnetic pulses. The spins interact with their nearest neighbors. We simulate the creation of the long-distance entanglement between remote qubits in the spin chain. Our method enables us to minimize unwanted non-resonant effects in a controlled way. The method we use cannot simulate complicated quantum logic (a quantum computer is required to do this), but it can be useful to test the experimental performance of simple quantum logic operations. We show that: (a) the probability distribution of unwanted states has a ``band'' structure, (b) the directions of spins in typical unwanted states are highly correlated, and (c) many of the unwanted states are high-energy states of a quantum computer (a spin chain). Our approach can be applied to simple quantum logic gates and fragments of quantum algorithms involving a large number of qubits.

abstract: Field quantization in three dimensional unstable optical systems is treated by expanding the vector potential in terms of non-Hermitean (Fox-Li) modes in both the cavity and external regions. The cavity non-Hermitean modes (NHM) are treated using the paraxial and monochromaticity approximations. The NHM bi-orthogonality relationships are used in a standard canonical quantization procedure based on introducing generalised coordinates and momenta for the electromagnetic (EM) field. The quantum EM field is equivalent to a set of quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), associated with either the cavity or the external region NHM. This confirms the validity of the photon model in unstable optical systems, though the annihilation and creation operators for each QHO are not Hermitean adjoints. The quantum Hamiltonian for the EM field is the sum of non-commuting cavity and external region contributions, each of which is sum of independent QHO Hamiltonians for each NHM, but the external field Hamiltonian also includes a coupling term responsible for external NHM photon exchange processes. Cavity energy gain and loss processes is associated with the non-commutativity of cavity and external region operators, given in terms of surface integrals involving cavity and external region NHM functions on the cavity-external region boundary. The spontaneous decay of a two-level atom inside an unstable cavity is treated using the essential states approach and the rotating wave approximation. Atomic transitions leading to cavity NHM photon absorption have a different coupling constant to those leading to photon emission, a feature resulting from the use of NHM functions. Under certain conditions the decay rate is enhanced by the Petermann factor.

abstract: We present models in which the indeterministic feature of Quantum Mechanics is represented in the form of definite physical mechanisms. Our way is completely different from so-called hidden parameter models, namely, we start from a certain variant of QM - deterministic QM - which has most features similar to QM, but the evolution in this theory is deterministic. Then we introduce the subquantum medium composed of so-called space-like objects. The interaction of a deterministic QM-particle with this medium is represented by the random force, but it is the random force governed by the probability amplitude distribution. This is the quantum random force and it is very different from classical random force. This implies that in our models there are no Bell`s inequalities and that our models (depending on a certain parameter tau) can be arbitrarily close to QM. The parameter tau defines a relaxation time and on time intervals shorter than tau, the evolution violates Heisenberg`s uncertainty principle and it is almost deterministic - spreading of the wave packet is much slower than in QM. Such type of short-time effects form the bases of proposed tests, which can, in principle, define limits of validity of QM. The proposed experiments are related to the behavior of quantum objects on short time intervals, where we expect the behavior different from QM. The main proposed feature is violation of uncertainty relations on short time intervals.

abstract: The ability to simulate one Hamiltonian with another is an important primitive in quantum information processing. In this paper, a simulation method for arbitrary $\sigma_z \otimes \sigma_z$ interaction based on Hadamard matrices (quant-ph/9904100) is generalized for any pairwise interaction. We describe two applications of the generalized framework. First, we obtain a class of protocols for selecting an arbitrary interaction term in an n-qubit Hamiltonian. This class includes the scheme given in quant-ph/0106064v2. Second, we obtain a class of protocols for inverting an arbitrary, possibly unknown n-qubit Hamiltonian, generalizing the result in quant-ph/0106085v1.

abstract: It is well known that no quantum bit commitment protocol is unconditionally secure. Nonetheless, there can be non-trivial upper bounds on both Bob's probability of correctly estimating Alice's commitment and Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires. In this paper, we seek to determine these bounds for generalizations of the BB84 bit commitment protocol. In such protocols, an honest Alice commits to a bit by randomly choosing a state from a specified set and submitting this to Bob, and later unveils the bit to Bob by announcing the chosen state, at which point Bob measures the projector onto the state. Bob's optimal cheating strategy can be easily deduced from well known results in the theory of quantum state estimation. We show how to understand Alice's most general cheating strategy, (which involves her submitting to Bob one half of an entangled state) in terms of a theorem of Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters. We also show how the problem of optimizing Alice's cheating strategy for a fixed submitted state can be mapped onto a problem of state estimation. Finally, using the Bloch ball representation of qubit states, we identify the optimal coherent attack for a class of protocols that can be implemented with just a single qubit. These results provide a tight upper bound on Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires in the protocol proposed by Aharonov et al., and lead us to identify a qubit protocol with even greater security.

Interesting Darboux generalizations of the fundamental Planck and pure vacuum cases are discussed in some detail with relevant plots. It is shown that the one-parameter Darboux-transformed Thermodynamics refers to superpositions of boson and fermion excitations of positive and negative absolute temperature, respectively. Recent results of Arnaud, Chusseau, and Philippe physics/0105048 regarding a single mode oscillator Carnot cycle are extended in the same Darboux perspective. We also conjecture a Darboux generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem

abstract: Taking into account the results that we have been obtained during the last decade in the foundations of quantum mechanic we put forward a view on reality that we call the 'creation discovery view'. In this view it is made explicit that a measurement is an act of a macroscopic physical entity on a microphysical entity that entails the creation of new elements of reality as well as the detection of existing elements of reality. Within this view most of the quantum mechanical paradoxes are due to structural shortcomings of the standard quantum theory, which means that our analysis agrees with the claim made in the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paper, namely that standards quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory. This incompleteness is however not due to the absence of hidden variables but to the impossibility for standard quantum mechanics to describe separated quantum entities. Nonlocality appears as a genuine property of nature in our view and makes it necessary to reconsider the role of space in reality. Our proposal for a new interpretation for space makes it possible to put forward an new hypothesis for why it has not been possible to unify quantum mechanics and relativity theory.

The scheme is based on the quantum scissors device proposed by Pegg, Phillips, and Barnett [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1604 (1998)] and uses photon-counting detectors, a single-photon source, and linear optical elements. Realistic features of the photon counting and single-photon generation are taken into account and possible error sources are discussed together with their effect on the fidelity and efficiency of the truncation process. Wigner function and phase distribution of the generated states are given and discussed for the evaluation of the proposed scheme.

comments: 17 pages, Latex

abstract: It has been experimentally demonstrated that quantum coherence can persist in macroscopic phenomena [J.R. Friedman et al.,Nature, 406 (2000) 43]. To face the challenge of this new fact, in this article QM in its standard form is assumed to be extended by one beable (hidden variable), i. e., a quantum observable with always definite values in nature (but usually only statistically given in the quantum state). Localization is taken as the most plausible beable. The paradoxical aspects of conventional QM take now a different form. Suitably defining the notion of "subject" fully within the QM formalism, proving the quantum conditional subsystem-state theorem, and choosing the relative-decoherence interpretation of QM, the paradoxes formally disappear, leaving one with decoherence relative to the definite values of the beable; thus being only appearance, not absolute reality in QM. Relative to a different subject one has perseverance of coherence. Hence, in this approach it is claimed that decoherence and coherence, both exist in reality, but are not "seen" by the same subject, and "subject" is, in this interpretation, indispensable. The two mentioned, apparently contradictory phenomena, are in this way decoupled from each other, contradiction is avoided, and any one of the two can be treated in the way that is usual in QM.

The normal modes of the coupled matter and radiation are determined through a full diagonalization of the dissipationless Hamiltonian. Away from the EIT resonance where the polaritons acquire an excited-state contribution, lifetimes are introduced as a secondary step. With detuning included various four-wave mixing possibilities are analyzed. We investigate specifically the possibility of reverting a stopped polariton by reversing the control beam.

abstract: It is shown that quantum mechanics can be regarded as what one might call a "fuzzy" mechanics whose underlying logic is the fuzzy one, in contradistinction to the classical "crisp" logic. Therefore classical mechanics can be viewed as a crisp limit of a "fuzzy" quantum mechanics. Based on these considerations it is possible to arrive at the Schroedinger equation directly from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The link between these equations is based on the fact that a unique ("crisp") trajectory of a classical particle emerges out of a continuum of possible paths collapsing to a single trajectory according to the principle of least action. This can be interpreted as a consequence of an assumption that a quantum "particle" "resides" in every path of the continuum of paths which collapse to a single(unique) trajectory of an observed classical motion. A wave function then is treated as a function describing a deterministic entity having a fuzzy character. As a consequence of such an interpretation, the complimentarity principle and wave-particle duality can be abandoned in favor of a fuzzy deterministic microoobject.

The important task is constructing quantum devices which will allow winning games of certain correlated replies against any classical team. A novel game of this type is proposed.

abstract: For the implementation of a quantum computer it is necessary to exercise complete control over the Hamiltonian of the used physical system. For NMR quantum computing the effectively acting Hamiltonian can be manipulated via pulse sequences. Here we examine a register consisting of N selectively addressable spins with pairwise coupling between each spin pair. We show that complete decoupling of the spins is possible independent of the particular form of the spin-spin interaction. The proposed method based on orthogonal arrays is efficient in the sense that the effort regarding time and amount of pulses increases only polynomially with the size N of the register. However, the effect of external control errors in terms of inaccurate control pulses eventually limits the achievable precision.

abstract: A new kind of deformed calculus (the D-deformed calculus) that takes place in fractional-dimensional spaces is presented. The D-deformed calculus is shown to be an appropriate tool for treating fractional-dimensional systems in a simple way and quite analogous to their corresponding one-dimensional partners. Two simple systems, the free particle and the harmonic oscillator in fractional- dimensional spaces are reconsidered into the framework of the D-deformed quantum mechanics. Confined states in a D-deformed quantum well are studied. D-deformed coherent states are also found.

abstract: We consider a class of general spin Hamiltonians of the form $H_s(t)=H_0(t)+H'(t)$ where $H_0(t)$ and $H'(t)$ describe the dipole interaction of the spins with an arbitrary time-dependent magnetic field and the internal interaction of the spins, respectively. We show that if $H'(t)$ is rotationally invariant, then $H_s(t)$ admits the same dynamical invariant as $H_0(t)$. A direct application of this observation is a straightforward rederivation of the results of Yan et al [Phys. Lett. A, Vol: 251 (1999) 289 and Vol: 259 (1999) 207] on the Heisenberg spin system in a changing magnetic field.

abstract: Analyzing two standard preparators, the Stern-Gerlach and the hole-in-the-screen ones, it is demonstrated that four entities are the basic ingredients of the theory: the composite-system preparator-plus-object state (coming about as a result of a suitable interaction between the subsystems), a suitable preparator observable, one of its characteristic projectors called the triggering event, and, finally, the conditional object state corresponding to the occurrence of the triggering event. The concepts of a conditional state and of retrospective apparent ideal occurrence are discussed in the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics. In the general theory of a preparator in this interpretation first-kind and second-kind preparators are distinguished. They are described by the same entities in the same way, but in terms of different physical mechanisms. In this article the relative-collapse interpretation is extended to encompass also preparators (besides measuring apparatuses). In this interpretation also the mechanisms become the same and one has only one kind of preparators.

abstract: We examine the topology of eigenenergy surfaces characterizing the population transfer processes based on adiabatic passage. We show that this topology is the essential feature for the analysis of the population transfers and the prediction of its final result. We reinterpret diverse known processes, such as stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), frequency-chirped adiabatic passage and Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage (SCRAP). Moreover, using this picture, we display new related possibilities of transfer. In particular, we show that we can selectively control the level which will be populated in STIRAP process in Lambda or V systems by the choice of the peak amplitudes or the pulse sequence.

abstract: A quantum manifestation of chaotic classical dynamics is found in the framework of oscillatory numbers statistics for the model of nonlinear dissipative oscillator. It is shown by numerical simulation of an ensemble of quantum trajectories that the probability distributions and variances of oscillatory number states are strongly transformed in the order-to-chaos transition. The nonclassical, sub-Poissonian statistics of oscillatory excitation numbers is established for chaotic dissipative dynamics in the framework of Fano factor and Wigner functions. These results are proposed for testing and experimental studing of quantum dissipative chaos.

Two types of potentials produced by various multiphoton Raman processes in a high-finesse cavity are examined. As an application the deflection of dressed atomic wave by a cavity mode is investigated. New momentum distribution of the atoms is derived that depends from the parameters of coherent field as well as photon states in the cavity.

abstract: Highly efficient quantum dense coding for continuous variables has been experimentally accomplished by means of exploiting bright EPR beam with anticorrelation of amplitude quadratures and correlation of phase quadratures, which is generated from a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier operating in the state of deamplification. Two bits of classical information are encoded on two quadratures of a half of bright EPR beam at the sender Alice and transmitted to the receiver Bob via one qubit of the shared quantum state after encoding. The amplitude and phase signals are simultaneously decoded with the other half of EPR beam by the direct measurement of the Bell-state at Bob. The signal to noise ratios of the simultaneously measured amplitude and phase signals are improved 5.4dB and 4.8dB with respect to that of the shot noise limit respectively. A high degree of immunity to unauthorized eavesdropping of the presented quantum communication scheme is experimentally demonstrated.

abstract: We consider the final stage of triple ionization of atoms in a strong linearly polarized laser field. We propose that for intensities below the saturation value for triple ionization the process is dominated by the simultaneous escape of three electrons from a highly excited intermediate complex. We identify within a classical model two pathways to triple ionization, one with a triangular configuration of electrons and one with a more linear one. Both are saddles in phase space. A stability analysis indicates that the triangular configuration has the larger cross sections and should be the dominant one. Trajectory simulations within the dominant symmetry subspace reproduce the experimentally observed distribution of ion momenta parallel to the polarization axis.

abstract: The intriguing suggestion of Tegmark (1996) that the universe--contrary to all our experiences and expectations--contains only a small amount of information due to an extremely high degree of internal symmetry is critically examined. It is shown that there are several physical processes, notably Hawking evaporation of black holes and non-zero decoherence time effects described by Plaga, as well as thought experiments of Deutsch and Tegmark himself, which can be construed as arguments against the low-information universe hypothesis. In addition, an extreme form of physical reductionism is entailed by this hypothesis, and therefore any possible argumentation against such reductionism would count against it either. Some ramifications for both quantum mechanics and cosmology are briefly discussed.

abstract: We show that the coarse-grained quantum baker's map exhibits a linear entropy increase at an asymptotic rate given by the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the classical chaotic baker's map. The starting point of our analysis is a symbolic representation of the map on a string of $N$ qubits, i.e., an $N$-bit register of a quantum computer. To coarse-grain the quantum evolution, we make use of the decoherent histories formalism. As a byproduct, we show that the condition of medium decoherence holds asymptotically for the coarse-grained quantum baker's map.

abstract: We point out a loophole problem in some recent experimental claims to produce three-particle entanglement. The problem consists in the question whether mixtures of two-particle entangled states might suffice to explain the experimental data. In an attempt to close this loophole, we review two sufficient conditions that distinguish between N-particle states in which all N particles are entangled to each other and states in which only M particles are entangled (with M<N). It is shown that three recent experiments to obtain three-particle entangled states (Bouwmeester et al., Pan et al., and Rauschenbeutel et al.) do not meet these conditions. We conclude that the question whether these experiments provide confirmation of three-particle entanglement remains unresolved. We also propose modifications of the experiments that would make such confirmation feasible.

abstract: Following the lead of Cochrane, Milburn, and Munro [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 62}, 062307 (2000)], we investigate theoretically quantum teleportation by means of the number-sum and phase-difference variables. We study Fock-state entanglement generated by a beam splitter and show that two-mode Fock-state inputs can be entangled by a beam splitter into close approximations of maximally entangled eigenstates of the phase difference and the photon-number sum (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen -- EPR -- states). Such states could be experimentally feasible with on-demand single-photon sources. We show that the teleportation fidelity can reach near unity when such ``quasi-EPR'' states are used as the quantum channel.

The technique can be used for fast generation of entangled atomic ensembles, spin squeezing and applications in quantum information processing.

abstract: The cloning of quantum variables with continuous spectra is investigated. We define a Gaussian 1-to-2 cloning machine, which copies equally well two conjugate variables such as position and momentum or the two quadrature components of a light mode. The resulting cloning fidelity for coherent states, namely $F=2/3$, is shown to be optimal. An asymmetric version of this Gaussian cloner is then used to assess the security of a continuous-variable quantum key distribution scheme that allows two remote parties to share a Gaussian key. The information versus disturbance tradeoff underlying this continuous quantum cryptographic scheme is then analyzed for the optimal individual attack. Methods to convert the resulting Gaussian keys into secret key bits are also studied. The extension of the Gaussian cloner to optimal $N$-to-$M$ continuous cloners is then discussed, and it is shown how to implement these cloners for light modes, using a phase-insensitive optical amplifier and beam splitters. Finally, a phase-conjugated inputs $(N,N')$-to-$(M,M')$ continuous cloner is defined, yielding $M$ clones and $M'$ anticlones from $N$ replicas of a coherent state and $N'$ replicas of its phase-conjugate (with $M'-M=N'-N$). This novel kind of cloners is shown to outperform the standard $N$-to-$M$ cloners in some situations.

abstract: In view of a three-dimensional picture (3D) of probability to find a particle at a plane of the frequency and the time (PTF) becomes that process of absorption and process of radiation for two - level system have different direction on the time. Both processes are in the past or in the future depending on named transition due to reversible model of the two-level atom. The opportunity to know the last history of the resonant event for the absorption process is for quantum interference interaction or for the resonant radiation. On the contrary, to predict the resonant event in the future is possible only by use near resonant atom-field absorption or by use radiation at a fixed time. The problem of life time for a particle is entered through time of spontaneous radiation connected with trajectory of the quantum transition. It is offered to connect a trajectory of a particle during quantum transitions with distribution of probability to find a particle. The conception of the spectral history for events due to probability distribution is introduced for next discussion.

abstract: I propose a "quantum annealing" heuristic for the problem of combinatorial search among a frustrated set of states characterized by a cost function to be minimized. The algorithm is probabilistic, with postselection of the measurement result. A unique parameter playing the role of an effective temperature governs the computational load and the overall quality of the optimization. Any level of accuracy can be reached with a computational load independent of the dimension {\it N} of the search set by choosing the effective temperature correspondingly low. This is much better than classical search heuristics, which typically involve computation times growing as powers of log({\it N})

comments: 13 pages, references updated
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: We show that quantum entanglement has a very close classical analogue, namely secret classical correlations. The fundamental analogy stems from the behavior of quantum entanglement under local operations and classical communication and the behavior of secret correlations under local operations and public communication. A large number of derived analogies follow. In particular teleportation is analogous to the one-time-pad, the concept of ``pure state'' exists in the classical domain, entanglement concentration and dilution are essentially classical secrecy protocols, and single copy entanglement manipulations have such a close classical analog that the majorization results are reproduced in the classical setting. This analogy allows one to import questions from the quantum domain into the classical one, and vice-versa, helping to get a better understanding of both. Also, by identifying classical aspects of quantum entanglement it allows one to identify those aspects of entanglement which are uniquely quantum mechanical.

It is numerically efficient and reveals a close relation between the KS invariant and the classical action. This formulation is extended to the quantum domain using the Madelung-Bohm orbits associated with the Schroedinger equation. The resulting quantum KS invariant for a given orbit equals the mean decay rate of the probability density along the orbit, while its ensemble average measures the mean growth rate of configuration-space information for the quantum system.

abstract: This Letter presents a method of electron entanglement generation. The system under consideration is a single-level quantum dot with one input and two output leads. The leads are arranged such that the dot is empty, single electron tunneling is suppressed by energy conservation, and two-electron virtual co-tunneling is allowed. This yields a pure, non-local spin-singlet state at the output leads. Coulomb interaction is the nonlinearity essential for entanglement generation, and, in its absence, the singlet state vanishes. This type of electron entanglement is a four-wave mixing process analogous to the photon entanglement generated by a Chi-3 parametric amplifier.

It is now well known that an unknown quantum state can neither be copied nor deleted perfectly. Given a set of states which are not necessarily orthogonal, is it possible to compare any two states from the set, given some reasonable ordering of such states? Is it possible to sort them in some specific order? In the context of quantum computation, it is shown here that there is no quantum circuit implementing a unitary transformation, for comparing and sorting an unrestricted set of quantum states.

abstract: A novel method of ground state laser cooling of trapped atoms utilizes the absorption profile of a three (or multi-) level system which is tailored by a quantum interference. With cooling rates comparable to conventional sideband cooling, lower final temperatures may be achieved. The method was experimentally implemented to cool a single Ca$^+$ ion to its vibrational ground state. Since a broad band of vibrational frequencies can be cooled simultaneously, the technique will be particularly useful for the cooling of larger ion strings, thereby being of great practical importance for initializing a quantum register based on trapped ions. We also discuss its application to different level schemes and for ground state cooling of neutral atoms trapped by a far detuned standing wave laser field.

abstract: Control fields in quantum information processing are virtually always, almost by definition, assumed to be classical. In reality, however, when such a field is used to manipulate the quantum state of qubits, the qubits never remain completely unentangled with the field. For quantum information processing this is an undesirable property, as it precludes perfect quantum computing and quantum communication. Here we consider the interaction of atomic qubits with laser fields and quantify atom-field entanglement in various cases of interest. We find that the entanglement decreases with the average number of photons $\bar{n}$ in a laser beam as $E\propto\log_2 \bar{n}/\bar{n}$ for $\bar{n}\to\infty$.

The quantum subroutine problem asks whether a quantum computer with an efficiently computable oracle can be efficiently simulated by a non-oracle quantum computer. We extends the earlier results obtained by Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani, and by Aharonov, Kitaev, and Nisan to the case where the oracle evaluates a unitary operator and the computer is allowed to be in the superposition of a query state and a non-query state during computation. We also prove the robustness of {\bf EQP}, {\bf BQP}, and {\bf ZQP} under the above general formulation, extending the earlier results on the robustness of {\bf BQP} shown by Bennett et al.

abstract: It has previously been shown that probabilistic quantum logic operations can be performed using linear optical elements, additional photons (ancilla), and post-selection based on the output of single-photon detectors. Here we describe the operation of several quantum logic operations of an elementary nature, including a quantum parity check and a quantum encoder, and we show how they can be combined to implement a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. All of these gates can be constructed using polarizing beam splitters that completely transmit one state of polarization and totally reflect the orthogonal state of polarization, which allows a simple explanation of each operation. We also describe a polarizing beam splitter implementation of a CNOT gate that is closely analogous to the quantum teleportation technique previously suggested by Gottesman and Chuang [Nature 402, p.390 (1999)]. Finally, our approach has the interesting feature that it makes practical use of a quantum-eraser technique.

abstract: In formal scattering theory, Green functions are obtained as solutions of a distributional equation. In this paper, we use the Sturm-Liouville theory to compute Green functions within a rigorous mathematical theory. We shall show that both the Sturm-Liouville theory and the formal treatment yield the same Green functions. We shall also show how the analyticity of the Green functions as functions of the energy keeps track of the so-called ``incoming'' and ``outgoing'' boundary conditions.

abstract: The description of the narrowing effect at high pressures is demonstrated on the example of CO2-He absorption for Q-, P-, and R-branches and for the head of the R-branch. The problem is focused on the physical meaning of this phenomenon that should be associated with the angular and translation momentum transfer to matter from the photon absorbed. The effect is described in the approximation of the single line without the conventional line mixing. A narrowing function is introduced that links the absorption in the resonance region with the one in far wings. This function enlarges the absorption of a single line approximately in two times in the resonance region at high pressures and decreases the one approximately in 20 times in far wings in comparison with the Lorentzian, independently of the type of molecule and pressures. The halfwidth of a single line is assumed to have a nonlinear pressure dependence and approaches to a saturated value at high pressures.

Lett. 83, 3566 (1999)}, i.e., given two incomparable bipartite states not only can the transformation be enabled by performing collective operations with an auxiliary entangled state, but the entanglement of the auxiliary state itself can be enhanced. We refer to this phenomenon as supercatalysis. We provide results on the properties of supercatalysis and its relationship with catalysis. In particular, we obtain a useful necessary and sufficient condition for catalysis, provide several sufficient conditions for supercatalysis and study the extent to which entanglement of the auxiliary state can be enhanced via supercatalysis.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107103
abstract: We propose a laser cooling concept for the translational motion of molecules which does not require repeated spontaneous emission by each molecule. The cooling works by repetition of three main steps: velocity selection of a narrow momentum width, deceleration of velocity selected molecules and accumulation of the decelerated molecules by an irreversible process, namely by single spontaneous emission. We develop a cooling model which enables analytical description of the transient populations and entropies for the total molecular system, the center of mass degree of freedom and the internal degrees of freedom. Simulation shows that the cooling process can reduce a large momentum width to a final width which in principle can be arbitrarily small. Center of mass entropy is reduced while the internal entropy is increased after cooling. We show that translational cooling can occur during coherent laser interactions. The entropies change in consistency with the Araki-Lieb inequality.

abstract: Sub-Poissonian light generation in the non-degenerate three-wave mixing is studied numerically and analytically within quantum and classical approaches. Husimi Q-functions and their classical trajectory simulations are analysed to reveal a special regime corresponding to the time-stable sub-Poissonian photocount statistics of the sum-frequency mode. Conditions for observation of this regime are discussed. Theoretical predictions of the Fano factor and explanation of the extraordinary stabilization of the sub-Poissonian photocount behavior are obtained analytically by applying the classical trajectories. Scaling laws for the maximum sub-Poissonian behavior are found. Noise suppression levels in the non-degenerate vs degenerate three-wave mixing are discussed on different time scales compared to the revival times. It is shown that the non-degenerate conversion offers much better stabilization of the suppressed noise in comparison to that of degenerate process.

We explore links between entanglement, coding theory, and sequence design, by examining multi-spectra of quantum states under local unitary action, and show that optimal error-correcting codes and sequences represent states with high multiparticle entanglement.

abstract: The Wehrl information entropy and its phase density, the so-called Wehrl phase distribution, are applied to describe Schr\"odinger cat and cat-like (kitten) states. The advantages of the Wehrl phase distribution over the Wehrl entropy in a description of the superposition principle are presented. The entropic measures are compared with a conventional phase distribution from the Husimi Q-function. Compact-form formulae for the entropic measures are found for superpositions of well-separated states. Examples of Schr\"odinger cats (including even, odd and Yurke-Stoler coherent states), as well as the cat-like states generated in Kerr medium are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, in contrast to the Wehrl entropy, the Wehrl phase distribution properly distinguishes between different superpositions of unequally-weighted states in respect to their number and phase-space configuration.

Thus this discrete approach to direct and inverse scattering problem can be considered as a tool of the S-matrix rational parametrization. As an application, the Bargmann potentials, phase-equivalent to the np $^1S_0$ Yamaguchi potential [7] and to the np potential from inverse scattering in the J-matrix approach [6] have been obtained.

abstract: We study the remote implementation of a unitary transformation on a qubit. We show the existence of non-trivial protocols (i.e., using less resources than bidirectional state teleportation) which allow the perfect remote implementation of certain continuous sets of quantum operations. We prove that, up to a local change of basis, only two subsets exist that can be implemented remotely with a non-trivial protocol: Arbitrary rotations around a fixed direction $\vec{n}$ and rotations by a fixed angle around an arbitrary direction lying in a plane orthogonal to $\vec{n}$. The overall classical information and distributed entanglement cost required for the remote implementation depends on whether it is a priori known to which of the two teleportable subsets the transformation belongs to. If it is so, the optimal protocol consumes one e-bit of entanglement and one c-bit in each direction. If the subset is not known, two e-bits of entanglement need to be consumed while the classical channel becomes asymmetric, two c-bits are conveyed from Alice to Bob but only one from Bob to Alice.

We show that if the emitter's signals are the orbit of a group, then the optimal detection method may not be a covariant measurement (contrary to widespread belief). It may be advantageous for the receiver to use a different group and an indirect estimation method: first, an ordinary measurement supplies redundant numerical parameters; the latter are then used for a nonlinear optimal identification of the signal.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0107119
abstract: The question of the discrimination of the Bell states of two qudits (i.e., d-dimensional quantum systems) by means of passive linear optical elements and conditional measurements is discussed. A qudit is supposed to be represented by d optical modes containing exactly one photon altogether. From recent results of Calsamiglia it follows that there is no way how to distinguish the Bell states of two qudits for d>2 - not even with the probability of success lower than one - without any auxiliary photons in ancillary modes. Following the results of Carollo and Palma it is proved that it is impossible to distinguish even only one such a Bell state with certainty (i.e., with the probability of success equal to one), irrespective of how many auxiliary photons are involved. However, it is shown that auxiliary photons can help to discriminate the Bell states of qudits with the high probability of success: A Bell-state analyzer based on the idea of linear optics quantum computation that can achieve the probability of success arbitrarily close to one is described. It requires many auxiliary photons that must be first "combined" into entangled states.

abstract: Deterministic extraction of Bell pairs from a finite number of partially entangled pairs is discussed. We derive the maximum number of Bell pairs that can be obtained with probability 1 by local operations and classical communication. It is proved that the optimal deterministic concentration needs only a two-pair collective manipulation in each step, and that a collective manipulation of all entangled pairs is not necessary. Finally, this scheme reveals an entanglement measure for the deterministic concentration.

The problem stems from the fact that ${\bf N}$ is bounded from below. In a previous work we have shown how to define the absolute phase observable ${\bf \Phi}\equiv |{\bf\phi}|$ by suitably restricting the Hilbert space of $x$ and $p$ like variables. Here we show that also from the classical point of view, there is no rigorous definition for the phase even though it's absolute value is well defined.

abstract: We extend the topos-theoretic treatment given in previous papers of assigning values to quantities in quantum theory. In those papers, the main idea was to assign a sieve as a partial and contextual truth value to a proposition that the value of a quantity lies in a certain set $\Delta \subseteq \mathR$. Here we relate such sieve-valued valuations to valuations that assign to quantities subsets, rather than single elements, of their spectra (we call these `interval' valuations). There are two main results. First, there is a natural correspondence between these two kinds of valuation, which uses the notion of a state's support for a quantity (Section 3). Second, if one starts with a more general notion of interval valuation, one sees that our interval valuations based on the notion of support (and correspondingly, our sieve-valued valuations) are a simple way to secure certain natural properties of valuations, such as monotonicity (Section 4).

abstract: We report on energy-time and time-bin entangled photon-pair sources based on a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide. Degenerate twin photons at 1314 nm wavelength are created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and coupled into standard telecom fibers. Our PPLN waveguide features a very high conversion efficiency of about 10^(-6), roughly 4 orders of magnitude more than that obtained employing bulk crystals. Even if using low power laser diodes, this engenders a significant probability for creating two pairs at a time - an important advantage for some quantum communication protocols. We point out a simple means to characterize the pair creation probability in case of a pulsed pump. To investigate the quality of the entangled states, we perform photon-pair interference experiments, leading to visibilities of 97% for the case of energy-time entanglement and of 84% for the case of time-bin entanglement. Although the last figure must still be improved, these tests demonstrate the high potential of PPLN waveguide based sources to become a key element for future quantum communication schemes

abstract: The possibility of coherent population trapping in two electron states with aligned spins (ortho-system) is evidenced. From the analysis of a three-level atomic system containing two electrons, and driven by the two laser fields needed for coherent population trapping, a conceptually new kind of two-electron dark state appears. The properties of this trapping are studied and are physically interpreted in terms of a dark hole, instead of a dark two-electron state. This technique, among many other applications, offers the possibility of measuring, with subnatural resolution, some superposition-state matrix-elements of the electron-electron correlation that due to their time dependent nature are inaccesible by standard measuring procedures.

abstract: The stabilizer code is the most general algebraic construction of quantum error-correcting codes proposed so far. A stabilizer code can be constructed from a self-orthogonal subspace of a symplectic space over a finite field. We propose a construction method of such a self-orthogonal space using an algebraic curve. By using the proposed method we construct an asymptotically good sequence of binary stabilizer codes. As a byproduct we improve the Ashikhmin-Litsyn-Tsfasman bound of quantum codes. The main results in this paper can be understood without knowledge of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We consider two quantum cryptographic schemes relying on encoding the key into qudits, i.e. quantum states in a d-dimensional Hilbert space. The first cryptosystem uses two mutually unbiased bases (thereby extending the BB84 scheme), while the second exploits all the d+1 available such bases (extending the six-state protocol for qubits). We derive the information gained by a potential eavesdropper applying a cloning-based individual attack, along with an upper bound on the error rate that ensures unconditional security against coherent attacks.

abstract: We show that standard teleportation with an arbitrary mixed state resource is equivalent to a generalized depolarizing channel with probabilities given by the maximally entangled components of the resource. This enables the usage of any quantum channel as a generalized depolarizing channel without additional twirling operations. It also provides a nontrivial upper bound on the entanglement of a class of mixed states. Our result allows a consistent and statistically motivated quantification of teleportation success in terms of the relative entropy and this quantification can be related to a classical capacity.

It is pointed out that there is a single phase operator dynamics underlying the dynamics of usual and deformed ladder operators.

abstract: Analytical arguments and numerical simulations suggest that the shapes of 3D microwave ionization curves measured by Koch and collaborators (see P. M. Koch and K. A. H. van Leeuwen, Phys. Rep. {\bf 255}, 289 (1995)) depend only weakly on the angular momentum of the atoms in the initial microcanonical ensemble, but strongly on the principal quantum number and the magnetic quantum number. Based on this insight, coupled with the computational power of a high-end 60-node Beowulf PC cluster, we present the first 3D quantum calculations of microwave ionization curves in the experimentally relevant parameter regime.

abstract: We study the deterministic entanglement of a pair of neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice by coupling to excited-state molecular hyperfine potentials. Information can be encoded in the ground-state hyperfine levels and processed by bringing atoms together pair-wise to perform quantum logical operations through induced electric dipole-dipole interactions. The possibility of executing both diagonal and exchange type entangling gates is demonstrated for two three-level atoms and a figure of merit is derived for the fidelity of entanglement. The fidelity for executing a CPHASE gate is calculated for two 87Rb atoms, including hyperfine structure and finite atomic localization. The main source of decoherence is spontaneous emission, which can be minimized for interaction times fast compared to the scattering rate and for sufficiently separated atomic wavepackets. Additionally, coherent couplings to states outside the logical basis can be constrained by the state dependent trapping potential.

It is shown that this change of the effective mass of a particle in the external electrical field (of a nucleus) results in displacement of atomic levels of electrons. The expressions describing these velocity changes and displacement of energy levels of electrons in the atom are obtained.

We establish the general quantum limits of noise in cold damping mechanisms and we show that the optomechanical system allows to reach these limits. Displacement noise can be arbitrarily reduced in a narrow frequency band. In a wide-band analysis we show that thermal fluctuations are reduced as with classical damping whereas quantum zero-point fluctuations are left unchanged. The only limit of cold damping is then due to zero-point energy of the mirror

The presence of a lossy channel and imperfect photodetection is considered. The advantages in using partially entangled states is discussed.

abstract: Quantum computing (or generally, quantum information processing) is of prime interest for it potentially has a significant impact on present electronics and computations1-5. Essence of quantum computing is a direct usage of the superposition and entanglement of quantum mechanical states that are pronounced in nanoscopic particles such as atoms and molecules6, 7. On the other hand, many proposals regarding the realization of semiconductor quantum dot (QD) qubits8,9 and QD quantum gates10 were reported and several experimental clues were successfully found11-16. While these pioneering experiments opened up the basis of semiconductor QD quantum computing, direct electrical control of superposed states in time domain17 has not been realized yet. Here, we demonstrate the coherent control of the superposed quantum states evolution in the QD molecule. Short electrical pulses are shown to inject single electron into the QD molecule and the current collected at the substrate exhibits oscillations as a function of the pulse width. The oscillations are originated from different decay rates of the symmetric (S) and the anti-symmetric (AS) state of the QD molecule and the evolution of the occupation probabilities controlled by the injection pulse width

The performance of the setup is monitored by {\em copropagative-beam} stimulated Raman spectroscopy of a cold cesium sample. The root mean-square value of the residual magnetic field is 300 $\mu G$, with a compensation bandwidth of 500 Hz. The shape of the observed spectra is theoretically interpreted and compares very well to numerically generated spectra.

abstract: We present a systematic simple method for constructing deterministic remote operations on single and multiple systems of arbitrary discrete dimensionality. These operations include remote rotations, remote interactions and measurements. The resources needed for an operation on a two-level system are one ebit and a bidirectional communication of two cbits, and for an n-level system, a pair of entangled n-level particles and two classical ``nits''. In the latter case, there are $n-1$ possible distinct operations per one n-level entangled pair. Similar results apply for generating interaction between a pair of remote systems and for remote measurements. We further consider remote operations on $N$ spatially distributed systems, and show that the number of possible distinct operations increases here exponentially, with the available number of entangled pairs that are initial distributed between the systems. Our results follow from the properties of a hybrid state-operator object (``stator''), which describes quantum correlations between states and operations.

abstract: I address the problem of indefiniteness in quantum mechanics: the problem that the theory, without changes to its formalism, seems to predict that macroscopic quantities have no definite values. The Everett interpretation is often criticised along these lines and I shall argue that much of this criticism rests on a false dichotomy: that the macroworld must either be written directly into the formalism or be regarded as somehow illusory. By means of analogy with other areas of physics, I develop the view that the macroworld is instead to be understood in terms of certain structures and patterns which emerge from quantum theory (given appropriate dynamics, in particular decoherence). I extend this view to the observer, and in doing so make contact with functionalist theories of mind.

This proof leads to a Bell inequality that allows more conclusive tests of Bell's theorem for three-qubit systems. Another Bell inequality involving both tri- and bipartite correlations is introduced which illustrates the different violations of local realism exhibited by the GHZ and W states.

We also introudce {\it biconcurrence} that leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for separability.

The implementation of the conditional beam splitting attack, based solely on linear optical elements, is well within reach of current technology.

abstract: By making use of the Green function concept of quantization of the electromagnetic field in Kramers--Kronig consistent media, a rigorous quantum mechanical derivation of the rate of intermolecular energy transfer in the presence of arbitrarily shaped, dispersing, and absorbing material bodies is given. Applications to bulk material, multi-slab planar structures, and microspheres are studied. It is shown that when the two molecules are near a planar interface, then surface-guided waves can strongly affect the energy transfer and essentially modify both the (F\"{o}rster) short-range $R^{-6}$ dependence of the transfer rate and the long-range $R^{-2}$ dependence, which are typically observed in free space. In particular, enhancement (inhibition) of energy transfer can be accompanied by inhibition (enhancement) of donor decay. Results for four- and five-layered planar structures are given and compared with experimental results. Finally, the energy transfer between two molecules located at diametrically opposite positions outside a microsphere is briefly discussed.

abstract: Sir Rudolph Peierls, in a reply to John Bell's last critique of the state of our understanding of quantum mechanics, maintained that it is easy to give an acceptable account of the physical significance of the quantum theory. The key is to recognize that all the density matrix characterizing a physical system ever represents is knowledge about that system. In answer to Bell's implicit rejoinder "Whose knowledge?" Peierls offered two simple consistency conditions that must be satisfied by density matrices that convey the knowledge different people might have about one and the same physical system: their density matrices must commute and must have a non-zero product. I describe a simple counterexample to his first condition, but show that his second condition, which holds trivially if the first does, continues to be valid in its absence. It is an open question whether any other conditions must be imposed.

Our result is the construction of an explicit time-dependent solution which we use to calculate the time-dependent survival probability of a quantum particle. The survival probability decays to zero in finite time, which means that the complex delta potential well is a total absorber for quantum particles. This potential can be interpreted as a killing measure with infinite killing rate concentrated at the origin.

abstract: Stochastic models for quantum state reduction give rise to statistical laws that are in most respects in agreement with those of quantum measurement theory. Here we examine the correspondence of the two theories in detail, making a systematic use of the methods of martingale theory. An analysis is carried out to determine the magnitude of the fluctuations experienced by the expectation of the observable during the course of the reduction process and an upper bound is established for the ensemble average of the greatest fluctuations incurred. We consider the general projection postulate of L\"uders applicable in the case of a possibly degenerate eigenvalue spectrum, and derive this result rigorously from the underlying stochastic dynamics for state reduction in the case of both a pure and a mixed initial state. We also analyse the associated Lindblad equation for the evolution of the density matrix, and obtain an exact time-dependent solution for the state reduction that explicitly exhibits the transition from a general initial density matrix to the L\"uders density matrix. Finally, we apply Girsanov's theorem to derive a set of simple formulae for the dynamics of the state in terms of a family of geometric Brownian motions, thereby constructing an explicit unravelling of the Lindblad equation.

abstract: The basic question that is addressed in this paper is finding the closest separable state for a given entangled state, measured with the Hilbert Schmidt distance. While this problem is in general very hard, we show that the following strongly related problem can be solved: find the Hilbert Schmidt distance of an entangled state to the set of all partially transposed states. We prove that this latter distance can be expressed as a function of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the entangled state, and show how it is related to the distance of a state to the set of positive partially transposed states (PPT-states). We illustrate this by calculating the closest biseparable state to the W-state, and give a simple and very general proof for the fact that the set of W-type states is not of measure zero. Next we show that all surfaces with states whose partial transposes have constant minimal negative eigenvalue are similar to the boundary of PPT states. We illustrate this with some examples on bipartite qubit states, where contours of constant negativity are plotted on two-dimensional intersections of the complete state space.

abstract: In the framework of a variational method with a single trial function an accurate study of the lowest gerade 1g and ungerade 1u electronic states of the molecular ion $H_2^+$ in a magnetic field is performed. Magnetic field ranges from 0 to 4.414x10^13 G and orientations of the molecular axis with respect to the magnetic line 0 \leq theta \leq 90 are considered. A one-parameter gauge dependent vector potential is used in the Hamiltonian, which is finally variationally optimized. A well pronounced minimum on the total energy surface of the (ppe) system in both 1g and 1u states is found for all magnetic fields and orientations studied. It is shown that for both states the parallel configuration (theta=0) at equilibrium always corresponds to the minimal total energy. It is found that for a given theta for both states the magnetic field growth is always accompanied by an increase in the total and binding energies as well as a shrinking of the equilibrium distance. We demonstrate that for B\gtrsim 1.8x10^11 G the molecular ion can dissociate, H2+ -> H + p, over a certain range of orientations (theta_cr \le theta \le 90), where the minimal thetaa_cr \simeq 25 occurs for the strongest magnetic field studied, B=4.414x10^13 G. For B<10^12 G the ion H2+ in 1g, 1u states is the most compact, being in the perpendicular configuration (theta=90), whereas for B\gtrsim 10^12 this occurs for an angle < 90. For the 1g state in any orientation, with the magnetic field growth at B \sim 10^11 G, a two-peak electronic distribution changes to single-peak one.

abstract: The stationary solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation can be divided in two classes: those which reduce, in the limit of vanishing nonlinearity, to the eigenfunctions of the associated Schr\"odinger equation and those which do not have linear counterpart. Analytical and numerical results support an existence condition for the solutions of the first class in terms of the ratio between their proper frequency and the corresponding linear eigenvalue. For one-dimensional confined systems, we show that solutions without linear counterpart do exist in presence of a multi-well external potential. These solutions, which in the limit of strong nonlinearity have the form of chains of dark or bright solitons located near the extrema of the potential, represent macroscopically excited states of a Bose-Einstein condensate and are in principle experimentally observable.

abstract: We propose a model to describe a gas of pyramidal molecules interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. A cooperative effect induced by the interaction modifies the tunneling properties between the classical equilibrium configurations of the single molecule. The model suggests that, for sufficiently high gas density, the molecules become localized in these classical configurations. On this basis it is possible to explain the shift and the disappearance of the inversion line observed upon increase of the pressure in a gas of ammonia or deuterated ammonia. The same mechanism also accounts for the presence of stable optical activity of certain pyramidal molecules. We discuss the concept of environment induced superselection rule which has been invoked in connection with this problem.

abstract: We propose a model to describe a gas of pyramidal molecules interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. The interaction modifies the tunneling properties between the classical equilibrium configurations of the single molecule and, for sufficiently high pressure, the molecules become localized in these classical configurations. We explain quantitatively, without free parameters, the shift to zero frequency of the inversion line observed upon increase of the pressure in a gas of ammonia or deuterated ammonia. For sufficiently high pressures, our model suggests the existence of a superselection rule for states of different chirality in substituted derivatives.

abstract: Berry phase was originally defined for systems whose states are separated by finite energy gaps. One might naively expect that a system without a gap cannot have a Berry phase. Despite this we ask whether a Berry phase can be observed in a system which has a continuous spectrum because its coupling to the environment has broadened its energy levels. We find that, contrary to the above naive expectation, there are conditions under which the Berry phase is observable. However it is modified by the presence of the environment and no longer has a simple geometric interpretation. The model system we consider is a spin-half in a slowly rotating magnetic field, with the spin also coupled to a Ohmic environment of harmonic oscillators (spin-boson model). Here we discuss the high-temperature limit of this model. We then interpret our results in terms of a spin under the influence of a classical stochastic field.

abstract: We demonstrate that two coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) at zero temperature can be used to realize a qubit which is the counterpart of Josephson charge qubits. The two BEC are weakly coupled and confined in an asymmetric double-well trap. When the "charging energy" of the system is much larger than the Josephson energy and the system is biased near a degeneracy point, the two BEC represent a qubit with two states differing only by one atom. The realization of the BEC qubits in realistic BEC experiments is briefly discussed.

abstract: Two parties, Alice and Bob, wish to distill a binary secret key out of a list of correlated variables that they share after running a quantum key distribution protocol based on continuous-spectrum quantum carriers. We present a novel construction that allows the legitimate parties to get equal bit strings out of correlated variables by using a classical channel, with as few leaked information as possible. This opens the way to securely correcting non-binary key elements. In particular, the construction is refined to the case of Gaussian variables as it applies directly to recent continuous-variable protocols for quantum key distribution.

abstract: In this essay it will be shown that Decoherence Model and Einstein Equivalence Principle are conceptually incompatible. In other words, assuming only the validity of the Weak Equivalence Principle the present work concludes that we face two possibilities: (i) if Decoherence Model provides a correct description of nature at quantum level, then there are systems which violate Local Position Invariance, or, (ii) if all the postulates behind Einstein Equivalence Principle are valid, even on quantum realm, then Decoherence Model breaks down in curved spacetimes. Finally, the present results are confronted against Schiff's conjecture.

abstract: First, the relation between black holes and limitations on information of other systems is developed. After reviewing the relation of entropy to information, we derive the entropy bound, review its applications to cosmology and its extensions to higher dimensions, and discuss why black holes behave as 1-D objects when emitting entropy. We also discuss fundamental limitations on the information of pulses in curved space, and on the rate of disposal of information into a black hole. We then move on to a discussion of quantum black holes motivated by the adiabatic invariance of horizon area of classical holes. We develop an algebraic formalism based on symmetry which gives information on the area (or mass) spectrum of quantum black holes, and on the degeneracy of the levels. This last turns out to be consistent with the horizon area-black hole entropy proportionality while leaving room for corrections.

abstract: In this work the possibility of detecting a non--Newtonian contribution to the gravitational potential by means of its effects upon the first and second--order coherence properties of light is analyzed. It will be proved that, in principle, the effects of a fifth force upon the correlation functions of electromagnetic radiation could be used to detect the existence of new forces. Some constraints upon the experimental parameters will also be deduced.

abstract: We consider the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field in the background of spherically symmetric dielectrics, subject to a cut-off frequency in the dispersion relations. The effect of this frequency dependent boundary condition between media is described in terms of the {\it incomplete} $\zeta$-functions of the problem. The use of the Debye asymptotic expansion for Bessel functions allows to determine the dominant (volume, area, ...) terms in the Casimir energy. The application of these expressions to the case of a gas bubble immersed in water is discussed, and results consistent with Schwinger's proposal about the role the Casimir energy plays in sonoluminescence are found.

abstract: The adiabatic invariant nature of black hole horizon area in classical gravity suggests that in quantum theory the corresponding operator has a discrete spectrum. I here develop further an algebraic approach to black hole quantization which starts from very elementary assumptions, and proceeds by exploiting symmetry. It predicts a uniformly spaced area spectrum for all charges and angular momenta. Area eigenvalues are degenerate; correspondence with black hole entropy then dictates a precise value for the interval between eigenvalues.

abstract: The quon algebra describes particles, ``quons,'' that are neither fermions nor bosons, using a label $q$ that parametrizes a smooth interpolation between bosons ($q = 1$) and fermions ($q = -1$). Understanding the relation of quons on the one side and bosons or fermions on the other can shed light on the different properties of these two kinds of operators and the statistics which they carry. In particular, local bilinear observables can be constructed from bosons and fermions, but not from quons. In this paper we construct bosons and fermions from quon operators. For bosons, our construction works for $-1 \leq q \leq 1$. The case $q=-1$ is paradoxical, since that case makes a boson out of fermions, which would seem to be impossible. None the less, when the limit $q \to -1$ is taken from above, the construction works. For fermions, the analogous construction works for $-1 \leq q \leq 1$, which includes the paradoxical case $q=1$.

abstract: We study the dynamical consequences of Maggiore's unique generalised uncertainty principle (GUP). We find that it leads naturally, and generically, to novel consequences. In the high temperature limit, there is a drastic reduction in the degrees of freedom, of the type found, for example, in strings far above the Hagedorn temperature. In view of this, the present GUP may perhaps be taken as the new version of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, conjectured by Atick and Witten to be responsible for such reduction. Also, the present GUP leads naturally to varying speed of light and modified dispersion relations. They are likely to have novel implications for cosmology and black hole physics, a few of which we discuss qualitatively.

abstract: We introduce the notion of pseudo-Hermiticity and show that every Hamiltonian with a real spectrum is pseudo-Hermitian. We point out that all the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians studied in the literature belong to the class of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and argue that the basic structure responsible for the particular spectral properties of these Hamiltonians is their pseudo-Hermiticity. We explore the basic properties of general pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, develop pseudo-supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and study some concrete examples, namely the Hamiltonian of the two-component Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the FRW-models coupled to a real massive scalar field and a class of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with a real spectrum.

This is done by introducing the theory of "asymptotic" PV-measures and their integral correspondence with positive asymptotic morphisms on locally compact spaces. Examples and applications involving various aspects of quantum physics, including quantum noise models, semiclassical limits, strong deformation quantizations, and pure half-spin particles, are also discussed.
