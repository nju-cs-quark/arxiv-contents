abstract: I obtain the dynamics of the continuous time quantum walk on a $d$-dimensional lattice, with periodic boundary conditions, as an appropriate limit of the dynamics of the discrete time quantum walk on the same lattice. This extends the main result of arXiv:quant-ph/0606050 which proved this limit for the infinite line. By highlighting the main features of the limiting procedure, I then extend it to general graphs. For a given discrete time quantum walk on a general graph, I single out the type of continuous dynamics (Hamiltonians) that can be obtained as a limit of the discrete time dynamics.

abstract: The Polya number of a classical random walk on a regular lattice is known to depend solely on the dimension of the lattice. For one and two dimensions it equals one, meaning unit probability to return to the origin. This result is extremely sensitive to the directional symmetry, any deviation from the equal probability to travel in each direction results in a change of the character of the walk from recurrent to transient. Applying our definition of the Polya number to quantum walks on a line we show that the recurrence character of quantum walks is more stable against bias. We determine the range of parameters for which biased quantum walks remain recurrent. We find that there exist genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent.

abstract: This paper studies the one-way communication complexity of the subgroup membership problem, a classical problem closely related to basic questions in quantum computing. Here Alice receives, as input, a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$; Bob receives an element $x \in G$. Alice is permitted to send a single message to Bob, after which he must decide if his input $x$ is an element of $H$. We prove the following upper bounds on the classical communication complexity of this problem in the bounded-error setting: (1) The problem can be solved with $O(\log |G|)$ communication, provided the subgroup $H$ is normal; (2) The problem can be solved with $O(d_{\max} \cdot \log |G|)$ communication, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible complex representations of $G$; (3) For any prime $p$ not dividing $|G|$, the problem can be solved with $O(d_{\max} \cdot \log p)$ communication, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible $\F_p$-representations of $G$.
