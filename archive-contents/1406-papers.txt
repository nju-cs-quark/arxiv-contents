abstract: We address an information-theoretic approach to noise and disturbance in quantum measurements. Properties of corresponding probability distributions are characterized by means of both the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies. Related information-theoretic measures of noise and disturbance are introduced. These definitions are based on the concept of conditional entropy. To motivate introduced measures, some important properties of the conditional R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies are discussed. There exist several formulations of entropic uncertainty relations for a pair of observables. Trade-off relations for noise and disturbance are derived on the base of known formulations of such a kind.

abstract: We study the scattering of guided light from a multilevel cesium atom with the transitions between the hyperfine levels $6S_{1/2}F=4$ and $6P_{3/2}F'=5$ of the $D_2$ line into the guided modes of a nanofiber. We show that the rate of scattering of guided light from the atom in the steady-state regime into the guided modes is asymmetric with respect to the forward and backward directions and depends on the polarization of the probe field. The asymmetry between the forward and backward scattering is a result of the complex transition structure of the atom and the existence of a longitudinal component of the guided-mode profile function. In the case of a two-level atom, the rates of spontaneous emission (and consequently the rates of scattering) into the forward and backward guided modes differ from each other when the atomic dipole matrix-element vector is a complex vector in the plane that contains the fiber axis and the atomic position.

abstract: Dispersion forces can have a sizable effect on the energy levels of highly excited Rydberg atoms when brought close to dielectric or metallic surfaces. Not only do Rydberg atoms suffers energy shifts on the order of several GHz at micrometer distances, the presence of a surface leads in addition to alteration and admixture of states both at zero and finite temperatures. Here, we show that, despite the fact that perturbation theory can no longer be applied for Rydberg atoms near a surface, its energy shift due to the dispersion interaction can be obtained from an exact Fano-type diagonalization of the interaction Hamiltonian. Moreover, we derive the fraction of state admixing in Rydberg atoms near surfaces with a view towards a spectroscopic determination of atom-surface distances.

abstract: One of the most important topics in the study of the dynamics of open quantum system is information exchange between system and environment. Based on the features of a back-flow information from an environment to a system, an approach is provided to detect non-Markovianity for unital dynamical maps. The method takes advantage of non-contractive property of the von Neumann entropy under completely positive and trace preserving unital maps. Accordingly, for the dynamics of a single qubit as an open quantum system, the sign of the time-derivative of the density matrix eigenvalues of the system determines the non-Markovianity of unital quantum dynamical maps. The main characteristics of the measure is to make the corresponding calculations and optimization procedure simpler.

abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has been demonstrated in both laboratories and field-tests using attenuated lasers combined with the decoy-state technique. Although researchers have studied various decoy-state MDI-QKD protocols with two or three decoy states, a clear comparison between these protocols is still missing. This invokes the question of how many types of decoy states are needed for practical MDI-QKD. Moreover, the system parameters to implement decoy-state MDI-QKD are only partially optimized in all previous works, which casts doubt on the actual performance of former demonstrations. Here, we present analytical and numerical decoy-state methods with one, two and three decoy states. We provide a clear comparison among these methods and find that two decoy states already enable a near optimal estimation and more decoy states cannot improve the key rate much in either asymptotic or finite-data settings. Furthermore, we perform a full optimization of system parameters and show that full optimization can significantly improve the key rate in the finite-data setting. By simulating a real experiment, we find that full optimization can increase the key rate by more than one order of magnitude compared to non-optimization. A local search method to optimize efficiently the system parameters is proposed. This method can be four orders of magnitude faster than a trivial exhaustive search to achieve a similar optimal key rate. We expect that this local search method could be valuable for general fields in physics.

abstract: In this thesis we investigate two new Amplified Quantum Transforms. In particular we create and analyze the Amplified Quantum Fourier Transform (Amplified-QFT) and the Amplified-Haar Wavelet Transform. First, we provide a brief history of quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Second, we examine the Amplified-QFT in detail and compare it against the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Quantum Hidden Subgroup (QHS) algorithms for solving the Local Period Problem. We calculate the probabilities of success of each algorithm and show the Amplified-QFT is quadratically faster than the QFT and QHS algorithms. Third, we examine the Amplified-QFT algorithm for solving The Local Period Problem with an Error Stream. Fourth, we produce an uncertainty relation for the Amplified-QFT algorithm. Fifth, we show how the Amplified-Haar Wavelet Transform can solve the Local Constant or Balanced Signal Decision Problem which is a generalization of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

abstract: The class of entangled $N$-qubit states known as graph states, and the corresponding stabilizer groups of $N$-qubit Pauli observables, have found a wide range of applications in quantum information processing and the foundations of quantum mechanics. A review of the properties of graph states is given and core spaces of graph states are introduced and discussed. A bonding model of entanglement for generalized graph states is then presented, in which the presence or absence of a bond between two qubits unequivocally specifies whether or not they are entangled. A physical interpretation of these bonds is given, along with a characterization of how they can be created or destroyed by entangling unitary operations and how they can be destroyed by local Pauli measurements. It is shown that local unitary operations do not affect the bond structure of a graph state, and therefore that if two graph states have nonisomorphic bond structures, then local unitary operations and/or reordering of qubits cannot change one into the other. Color multigraphs are introduced to depict the bond structures of graph states and to make some of their properties more apparent.

abstract: We propose a principled way of defining and measuring contextuality in systems with deterministic inputs and random outputs. We illustrate it on systems with two binary inputs and two binary random outputs, the prominent example being the system of two entangled spin-half particles with each particle's spins (random outputs) being measured along one of two directions (inputs). It is traditional to say that such a system exhibits contextuality when it violates Bell-type inequalities. Derivations of Bell-type inequalities, however, are based on the assumption of no-signaling, more generally referred to as marginal selectivity: the distributions of outputs (spins) in Alice's particle do not depend on the inputs (directions chosen) for Bob's particle. In many applications this assumption is not satisfied, so that instead of contextuality one has to speak of direct cross-influences, e.g., of Bob's settings on Alice's spin distributions. While in quantum physics direct cross-influences can sometimes be prevented (e.g., by space-like separation of the two particles), in other applications, especially in behavioral and social systems, marginal selectivity almost never holds. It is unsatisfying that the highly meaningful notion of contextuality is made inapplicable by even slightest violations of marginal selectivity. Our new approach rectifies this: it allows one to define and measure contextuality on top of direct cross-influences, irrespective of whether marginal selectivity (no-signaling condition) holds. For systems with two binary inputs and two binary random outputs, contextuality means violation of the classical CHSH inequalities in which the upper bound 2 is replaced with 2(1+\Delta_{0}), where \Delta_{0} is a measure of deviation from marginal selectivity.

We further investigate the parameter space where the Two-Level model can still be justified.

abstract: In this paper we investigate repeated weak measurements (without post-selection [1, 2]), on a single copy. By a careful analysis of errors, it is shown that there is a tradeoff between errors and invasiveness. Lower the errors, greater the invasiveness. Though the outcomes are not independently distributed, an analytical expression is obtained for how averages are distributed, which is shown to be the way outcomes are distributed in a strong measurement, in stark contrast to the central limit theorem. An error-disturbance relation, though not of the Ozawa-type [3], is also derived. In the limit of vanishing errors, the invasiveness approaches what would obtain from strong measurements.

abstract: Recent experimental progress in the creation of synthetic electric and magnetic fields, acting on cold atoms in a two-dimensional lattice, has attracted renewed interest to the problem of a quantum particle in the Hall configuration. The present work contains a detailed analysis of the eigenstates of this system, called Landau-Stark states, and of the associated dynamical phenomenon of cyclotron-Bloch oscillations. It is shown that Landau-Stark states and cyclotron-Bloch oscillations crucially depend on two factors. The first is the orientation of the electric field relative to the primary axes of the lattice. The second is ratio between the frequencies of Bloch and cyclotron oscillations, that is also the ratio between the magnitudes of electric and magnetic fields. The analysis is first carried out in the tight-binding approximation, where the magnetic field is characterized by the Peierls phase entering the hopping matrix elements. Agreement of this analysis with the full quantum theory is also studied.

abstract: We consider rather general spin-$1/2$ lattices with large coordination numbers $Z$. Based on the monogamy of entanglement and other properties of the concurrence $C$, we derive rigorous bounds for the entanglement between neighboring spins, such as $C\leq 1/\sqrt{Z}$, which show that $C$ decreases for large $Z$. In addition, the concurrence $C$ measures the deviation from mean-field behavior and can only vanish if the mean-field ansatz yields an exact ground state of the Hamiltonian. Motivated by these findings, we propose an improved mean-field ansatz by adding entanglement.

We show that such networks are sufficient for search tasks due to the small-world and scale-free properties. In particular we present a strategy that allows to design efficient measurement rules regardless of the localization of the marked node. We derive the optimal measurement step for the repeatable search approach and we estimate the complexity of the introduced algorithm. We show that it is possible to obtain quadratic speed-up observed in the Grover's algorithm quadratically reducing the complexity of the network at the same time.

abstract: In traditional quantum optics, where the interaction between atoms and light at optical frequencies is studied, the atoms can be approximated as point-like when compared to the wavelength of light. So far, this relation has also been true for artificial atoms made out of superconducting circuits or quantum dots, interacting with microwave radiation. However, recent and ongoing experiments using surface acoustic waves show that a single artificial atom can be coupled to a bosonic field at several points wavelengths apart. Here, we theoretically study this type of system. We find that the multiple coupling points give rise to a frequency dependence in the coupling strength between the atom and its environment, and also in the Lamb shift of the atom. The frequency dependence is given by the discrete Fourier transform of the coupling point coordinates and can therefore be designed. We discuss a number of possible applications for this phenomenon, including tunable coupling, single-atom lasing, and other effects that can be achieved by designing the relative coupling strengths of different transitions in a multi-level atom.

abstract: We investigate the nonclassical properties of output fields propagated through a contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler consisting of a linear waveguide and a nonlinear (quadratic) waveguide operated by second harmonic generation. In contrast to the earlier results, all the initial fields are considered weak and a completely quantum mechanical model is used here to describe the system. Perturbative solutions of Heisenberg's equations of motion for various field modes are obtained using Sen-Mandal technique. Obtained solutions are subsequently used to show the existence of single-mode and intermodal squeezing, single-mode and intermodal antibunching, two-mode and multi-mode entanglement in the output of contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler. Further, existence of higher order nonclassicality is also established by showing the existence of higher order antibunching, higher order squeezing and higher order entanglement. Variation of observed nonclassical characters with different coupling constants and phase mismatch is discussed.

abstract: I generalize the concept of balancedness to qudits with arbitrary dimension $d$. It is an extension of the concept of balancedness in New J. Phys. {\bf 12}, 075025 (2010) [1]. At first, I define maximally entangled states as being the stochastic states (with local reduced density matrices $\id/d$ for a $d$-dimensional local Hilbert space) that are not product states and show that every so-defined maximal genuinely multi-qudit entangled state is balanced. Furthermore, all irreducibly balanced states are genuinely multi-qudit entangled and are locally equivalent with respect to $SL(d)$ transformations (i.e. the local filtering transformations (LFO)) to a maximally entangled state. In particular the concept given here gives the maximal genuinely multi-qudit entangled states for general local Hilbert space dimension $d$. All genuinely multi-qudit entangled states are an element of the partly balanced $SU(d)$-orbits.

Here, we provide an extended analysis of this witness by introducing analytical bounds and by reporting measurements confirming its great robustness with regard to losses. This study highlights the potential of optical hybrid methods, where discrete entanglement is characterized through continuous-variable measurements.

abstract: For quantum key distribution (QKD) using spontaneous parametric-down-conversion sources (SPDCSs), the passive decoy-state protocol has been proved to be efficiently close to the theoretical limit of an infinite decoy-state protocol. In this paper, we apply a tight finite-key analysis for the passive decoy-state QKD using SPDCSs. Combining the security bound based on the uncertainty principle with the passive decoy-state protocol, a concise and stringent formula for calculating the key generation rate for QKD using SPDCSs is presented. The simulation shows that the secure distance under our formula can reach up to 182 km when the number of sifted data is $10^{10}$. Our results also indicate that, under the same deviation of statistical fluctuation due to finite-size effects, the passive decoy-state QKD with SPDCSs can perform as well as the active decoy-state QKD with a weak coherent source.

For some initial Werner-like states delayed entanglement generation can be observed. We investigate the influence of two damping mechanisms on the system's evolution. We show that for the both cases, the entanglement can survive despite the presence of damping, and the effects of sudden entanglement death and its rebirth can appear in the system.

The quantum state evolution equation can also be obtained without resorting to quantum Hamiltonian or Lagrangian. Starting with classical Newton equation, quantum transition amplitude of the system can be educed by surface integral.

abstract: A causal model is an abstract representation of a physical system as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where the statistical dependencies are encoded using a graphical criterion called `d-separation'. Recent work by Wood & Spekkens shows that causal models cannot, in general, provide a faithful representation of quantum systems. Since d-separation encodes a form of Reichenbach's Common Cause Principle (RCCP), whose validity is questionable in quantum mechanics, we propose a generalised graph separation rule that does not assume the RCCP. We prove that the new rule faithfully captures the statistical dependencies between observables in a quantum network, encoded as a DAG, and is consistent with d-separation in a classical limit. We note that the resulting model is still unable to give a faithful representation of correlations stronger than quantum mechanics, such as the Popescu-Rorlich box.

abstract: We present a two-state practical quantum bit commitment protocol, the security of which is based on the current technological limitations, namely the nonexistence of either stable long-term quantum memories or nondemolition measurements. For an optical realization of the protocol, we model the errors, which occur due to the noise and equipment (source, fibers, and detectors) imperfections, accumulated during emission, transmission, and measurement of photons. The optical part is modeled as a combination of a depolarizing channel (white noise), unitary evolution (e.g., systematic rotation of the polarization axis of photons), and two other basis-dependent channels, namely the phase- and bit-flip channels. We analyze quantitatively the effects of noise using two common information-theoretic measures of probability distribution distinguishability: the fidelity and the relative entropy. In particular, we discuss the optimal cheating strategy and show that it is always advantageous for a cheating agent to add some amount of white noise - the particular effect not being present in standard quantum security protocols. We also analyze the protocol's security when the use of (im)perfect nondemolition measurements and noisy or bounded quantum memories is allowed. Finally, we discuss errors occurring due to a finite detector efficiency, dark counts, and imperfect single-photon sources, and we show that the effects are the same as those of standard quantum cryptography.

In the case of a resonance of a width $\Gamma$, the effect would be observed if the time between the two impacts is of order of $\hbar/\Gamma$. The statistics of non-resonance tunnelling across a broad potential barrier remain unaffected, which suggests that there is no appreciable delay in the classically forbidden region.

abstract: We introduce a new analytical method for studying the open quantum systems problem of a discrete system weakly coupled to an environment of harmonic oscillators. Our approach is based on a phase space representation of the density matrix for a system coupled to a two-tiered environment. The dynamics of the system and its immediate environment are resolved in a non-Markovian way, and the environmental modes of the inner environment can themselves be damped by a wider `universe'. Applying our approach to the canonical cases of the Rabi and spin-boson models we obtain new analytical expressions for an effective thermalisation temperature and corrections to the environmental response functions as direct consequences of considering such a tiered environment. A comparison with exact numerical simulations confirms that our approximate expressions are remarkably accurate, while their analytic nature offers the prospect of deeper understanding of the physics which they describe. A unique advantage of our method is that it permits the simultaneous inclusion of a continuous bath as well as discrete environmental modes, leading to wide and versatile applicability.

abstract: We investigate a system constituted by two interacting qubits having one of them isolated and the other coupled to a thermal reservoir. We analyze the dynamics of the system considering two different models of system-reservoir interaction: i) a "microscopic" model, in which the master equation is derived taking into account the interaction between the two subsystems (qubits); ii) a "phenomenological" model, in which the master equation consists of a dissipative term simply added to the unitary evolution term. We obtain an analytical solution of the microscopic model without performing the rotating wave approximation for the qubit-qubit interaction; this allows us to compare the results from both models for a wide range of inter-qubit coupling constants. We show that in the strong coupling regime, the expected thermal equilibrium steady state for the two-qubit system naturally arises in the framework of the microscopic model, while in the phenomenological approach it is obtained a steady state density operator which is not correct. We also make a comparative study of the dynamics of the qubit-qubit entanglement and the quantum coherence associated to the isolated qubit. Furthermore, we find that even in the weak coupling regime, there are also important disagreements between the predictions of the two models. Namely, while according to the microscopic model the isolated qubit would approach a maximally mixed state faster for higher temperatures, the phenomenological model gives just the opposite behavior, i.e., it would take longer for the qubit state to become maximally mixed for higher temperatures of the reservoir.

abstract: Steering is the entanglement-based quantum effect that embodies the "spooky action at a distance" disliked by Einstein and scrutinized by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen. Here we provide a necessary and sufficient characterization of steering, based on a quantum information processing task: the discrimination of branches in a quantum evolution, which we dub subchannel discrimination. We prove that, for any bipartite steerable state, there are instances of the quantum subchannel discrimination problem for which this state allows a correct discrimination with strictly higher probability than in absence of entanglement, even when measurements are restricted to local measurements aided by one-way communication. On the other hand, unsteerable states are useless in such conditions, even when entangled. We also prove that the above steering advantage can be exactly quantified in terms of the steering robustness, which is a natural measure of the steerability exhibited by the state.

abstract: We study cooling performance of a realistic mechanical resonator containing defects. The normal cooling method through an optomechanical system does not work efficiently due to those defects. We show by employing periodical $\sigma_z$ pulses, we can eliminate the interaction between defects and their surrounded heat baths up to the first order of time. Compared with the cooling performance of no $\sigma_z$ pulses case, much better cooling results are obtained. Moreover, this pulse sequence has an ability to improve the cooling performance of the resonator with different defects energy gaps and different defects damping rates.

abstract: Quantum private query (QPQ) is a kind of quantum protocols to protect both users' privacy in their communication. There is an interesting example, that is, Alice wants to buy one item from Bob's database, which is composed of a quantity of valuable messages. QPQ protocol is the communication procedure ensuring that Alice can get only one item from Bob, and at the same time, Bob cannot know which one was taken by Alice. Owing to its practicability, quantum-key-distribution-based QPQ has draw much attention in recent years. However, the post-processing of the key in such protocols, called oblivious key, remains far from being satisfactorily known. Especially, the error correction method for such special key is still missing. Here we focus on the post-processing of the oblivious key, including both dilution and error correction. On the one hand, we demonstrate that the previous dilution method, which greatly reduces the communication complexity, will bring Alice the chance to illegally obtain much additional information about Bob's database. Simulations show that by very limited queries Alice can obtain the whole database. On the other hand, we present an effective error-correction method for the oblivious key, which completes its post-processing and makes such QPQ more practical.

abstract: Many advocates of the Everettian interpretation consider that theirs is the only approach to take quantum mechanics really seriously, and that this approach allows to deduce a fantastic scenario for our reality, one that consists of an infinite number of parallel worlds that branch out continuously. In this article, written in dialogue form, we suggest that quantum mechanics can be taken even more seriously, if the 'many-worlds' view is replaced by a 'many-measurements' view. This allows not only to derive the Born rule, thus solving the measurement problem, but also to deduce a one-world 'non-spatial' reality, providing an even more fantastic scenario than that of the multiverse.

We discuss the photophysical limitations of the currently used quantum emitters for the realization of such a device.

It is shown that ghost interference is a combined effect of virtual double-slit creation due to entanglement, and quantum erasure of which-path information for the interfering photon. For the case where the two photons are of different color, it is shown that fringe width of the interfering photon depends not only on its own wavelength, but also on the wavelength of the other photon which it is entangled with.

We show that the optimal force sensitivity obtained by the quantum estimation theory approaches to zero for the non-Markovian bath, whereas approaches to a finite non-zero value for the Markovian bath as the energy of the damped oscillator goes to infinity.

abstract: We review canonical experiments on systems that have pushed the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds towards much larger scales, and discuss their unique features that enable quantum coherence to survive. Because the types of systems differ so widely, we use a case by case approach to identifying the different parameters and criteria that capture their behaviour in a quantum mechanical framework. We find it helpful to categorise systems into three broad classes defined by mass, spatio-temporal coherence, and number of particles. The classes are not mutually exclusive and in fact the properties of some systems fit into several classes. We discuss experiments by turn, starting with interference of massive objects like macromolecules and micro-mechanical resonators, followed by self-interference of single particles in complex molecules, before examining the striking advances made with superconducting qubits. Finally, we propose a theoretical basis for quantifying the macroscopic features of a system to lay the ground for a more systematic comparison of the quantum properties in disparate systems.

abstract: Nanophotonic structures are routinely used to enhance light matter interactions by modifying the density of virtual photon states. This is often simplified to a scalar quantity, the local density of states (LDOS). However we show that the virtual photons also contain phase information. We show that the phase information of an emitter interacting with a modified density of virtual photon states has a non-trivial, non-intuitive behaviour. This extra phase information is vital in practical design of integrated quantum photonic circuits. We consider a quantum dot (QD) electron spin transition in a photonic crystal waveguide (PhCWG). The mode of a PhCWG is complex with local polarization variation across the crystal lattice. By placing the QD at a polarization singularity in the photonic mode, we show unidirectional emission, with a one-to-one correlation of spin orientation to path. We show a range of new functionalities suited to integrated photonic circuits, including spin-photon interfaces and photonic cluster state generation.

abstract: The paper seeks to make progress from stating primitive ontology theories of quantum physics, notably Bohmian mechanics, the GRW matter density theory and the GRW flash theory, to assessing these theories. Four criteria are set out: (a) internal coherence; (b) empirical adequacy; (c) relationship to other theories; (d) explanatory value. The paper argues that the stock objections against these theories do not withstand scrutiny. Its focus then is on their explanatory value: they pursue different strategies to ground the textbook formalism of quantum mechanics, and they develop different explanations of quantum non-locality. In conclusion, it is argued that Bohmian mechanics offers a better prospect for making quantum non-locality intelligible than the GRW matter density theory and the GRW flash theory.

abstract: Ozawa's measurement-disturbance relation is generalized to a phase-space noncommutative extension of quantum mechanics. It is shown that the measurement-disturbance relations have additional terms for backaction evading quadrature amplifiers and for noiseless quadrature transducers. Several distinctive features appear as a consequence of the noncommutative extension: measurement interactions which are noiseless, and observables which are undisturbed by a measurement, or of independent intervention in ordinary quantum mechanics, may acquire noise, become disturbed by the measurement, or no longer be an independent intervention in noncommutative quantum mechanics. It is also found that there can be states which violate Ozawa's universal noise-disturbance trade-off relation, but verify its noncommutative deformation.

abstract: The parametrized Dirac wave equation represents position and time as operators, and can be formulated for many particles. It thus provides, unlike field-theoretic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), an elementary and unrestricted representation of electrons entangled in space or time. The parametrized formalism leads directly and without further conjecture to the Bethe-Salpeter equation for bound states. The formalism also yields the Uehling shift of the hydrogenic spectrum, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to leading order in the fine structure constant, the Lamb shift and the axial anomaly of QED.

This is proven by defining a symmetric quantum state that is n-partite SLOCC inequivalent to the W state, and then constructing a totally correct anonymous leader election protocol using this state. This result, which contradicts the previous necessity result of D'Hondt and Panangaden, furthers our understanding of how non-local quantum states can be used as a resource for distributed computation.

abstract: Exquisite quantum control has now been achieved in small ion traps, in nitrogen-vacancy centres and in superconducting qubit clusters. We can regard such a system as a universal cell with diverse technological uses from communication to large-scale computing, provided that the cell is able to network with others and overcome any noise in the interlinks. Here we show that loss-tolerant entanglement purification makes quantum computing feasible with the noisy and lossy links that are realistic today: With a modestly complex cell design, and using a surface code protocol with a network noise threshold of 13.3%, we find that interlinks which attempt entanglement at a rate of 2MHz but suffer 98% photon loss can result in kilohertz computer clock speeds (i.e. rate of high fidelity stabilizer measurements). Improved links would dramatically increase the clock speed. Our simulations employed local gates of a fidelity already achieved in ion trap devices.

abstract: Optical waveguides in the form of glass fibers are the backbone of global telecommunication networks. In such optical fibers, the light is guided over long distances by continuous total internal reflection which occurs at the interface between the fiber core with a higher refractive index and the lower index cladding. Although this mechanism ensures that no light escapes from the waveguide, it gives rise to an evanescent field in the cladding. While this field is protected from interacting with the environment in standard optical fibers, it is routinely employed in air- or vacuum-clad fibers in order to efficiently couple light fields to optical components or emitters using, e.g., tapered optical fiber couplers. Remarkably, the strong confinement imposed by the latter can lead to significant coupling of the light's spin and orbital angular momentum. Taking advantage of this effect, we demonstrate the controlled directional spontaneous emission of light by quantum emitters into a sub-wavelength-diameter waveguide. The effect is investigated in a paradigmatic setting, comprising cesium atoms which are located in the vicinity of a vacuum-clad silica nanofiber. We experimentally observe an asymmetry higher than 10:1 in the emission rates into the counterpropagating fundamental guided modes of the nanofiber. Moreover, we demonstrate that this asymmetry can be tailored by state preparation and suitable excitation of the quantum emitters. We expect our results to have important implications for research in nanophotonics and quantum optics and for implementations of integrated optical signal processing in the classical as well as in the quantum regime.

abstract: Recent experiments on fluid-dynamical systems have revealed a series of striking quantum-like features of these macroscopic systems, thus reviving the quest to describe quantum mechanics by classical, in particular fluid-dynamical, theories. However, it is generally admitted that such an endeavor is impossible, on the basis of the 'no-go' theorems of Bell and Kochen-Specker. Here we show that such theorems are inoperative for fluid-dynamical models, even if these are local. Such models appear to violate one of the premises of both theorems, and can reproduce the quantum correlation of the Bell experiment. Therefore the statement that 'local hidden-variable theories are impossible' appears to be untenable for theories just slightly more general than originally envisaged by Bell. We also discuss experimental implications.

abstract: We provide numerical evidence that the quantum Fourier transform can be efficiently represented in a matrix product operator with a size growing relatively slowly with the number of qubits. Additionally, we numerically show that the tensors in the operator converge to a common tensor as the number of qubits in the transform increases. Together these results imply that the application of the quantum Fourier transform to a matrix product state with $n$ qubits of maximum Schmidt rank $\chi$ can be simulated in $O(n (log(n))^2 \chi^2)$ time. We perform such simulations and quantify the error involved in representing the transform as a matrix product operator and simulating the quantum Fourier transform of periodic states.

abstract: A continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) protocol using squeezed states is proposed where the two legitimate partners send Gaussian-modulated squeezed states to an untrusted third party to realize the measurement. Security analysis shows that the protocol can not only defend all detector side channels, but also attain higher secret key rates than the coherent-state-based protocol. We also present a method to improve the squeezed-state CV-MDI QKD protocol by adding proper Gaussian noise to the reconciliation side. It is found that there is an optimal added noise to optimize the performance of the protocol in terms of both key rates and maximal transmission distances. The resulting protocol shows the potential of long-distance secure communication using the CV-MDI QKD protocol.

The conditions also enable the parametrisation of new families of games which have no quantum advantage, for arbitrary input probability distributions up to certain symmetries. In the future, these might be used in information-theoretic studies on reproducing the set of quantum non-local correlations.

abstract: Utilizing the tools of quantum optics to prepare and manipulate quantum states of motion of a mechanical resonator is currently one of the most promising routes to explore non-classicality at a macroscopic scale. An important quantum optomechanical tool yet to be experimentally demonstrated is the ability to perform complete quantum state reconstruction. Here, after providing a brief introduction to quantum states in phase space, we review and contrast the current proposals for state reconstruction of mechanical motional states and discuss experimental progress. Furthermore, we show that mechanical quadrature tomography using back-action-evading interactions gives an $s$-parameterized Wigner function where the numerical parameter $s$ is directly related to the optomechanical measurement strength. We also discuss the effects of classical noise in the optical probe for both state reconstruction and state preparation by measurement.

abstract: Quantum theory (QT), namely in terms of Schr\"odinger's 1926 wave functions in general requires complex numbers to be formulated. However, it soon turned out to even require some hypercomplex algebra. Incorporating Special Relativity leads to an equation (Dirac 1928) requiring pairwise anti-commuting coefficients, usually $4\times 4$ matrices. A unitary ring of square matrices is an associative hypercomplex algebra by definition. Since only the algebraic properties and relations of the elements matter, we replace the matrices by biquaternions. In this paper, we first consider the basics of non-relativistic and relativistic QT. Then we introduce general hypercomplex algebras and also show how a relativistic quantum equation like Dirac's one can be formulated using biquaternions. Subsequently, some algebraic preconditions for operations within hypercomplex algebras and their subalgebras will be examined. For our purpose equations akin to Schr\"odinger's should be able to be set up and solved. Functions of complementary variables should be Fourier transforms of each other. This should hold within a purely non-real subspace which must hence be a subalgebra. Furthermore, it is an ideal denoted by $\mathcal{J}$. It must be isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, hence containing an internal identity element. The bicomplex numbers will turn out to fulfil these preconditions, and therefore, the formalism of QT can be developed within its subalgebras. We also show that bicomplex numbers encourage the definition of several different kinds of conjugates. One of these treats the elements of $\mathcal{J}$ like the usual conjugate treats complex numbers. This defines a quantity what we call a modulus which, in contrast to the complex absolute square, remains non-real (but may be called `pseudo-real'). However, we do not conduct an explicit physical interpretation here but we leave this to future examinations.

abstract: The influence of thermal noise on bipartite and tripartite quantum steering induced by a short laser pulse in a hybrid three-mode optomechanical system is investigated. The calculation is carried out under the bad cavity limit, the adiabatic approximation of a slowly varying amplitude of the cavity mode, and with the assumption of driving the cavity mode with a blue detuned strong laser pulse. Under such conditions, explicit expressions of the bipartite and tripartite steering parameters are obtained, and the concept of collective tripartite quantum steering, recently introduced by He and Reid [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 250403 (2013)], is clearly explored. It is found that both bipartite and tripartite steering parameters are sensitive functions of the initial state of the modes and distinctly different steering behaviour could be observed depending on whether the modes were initially in a thermal state or not. We find that the initial thermal noise is more effective in destroying the bipartite rather than the tripartite steering which, on the other hand, can persist even for a large thermal noise. For the initial vacuum state of a steered mode, the tripartite steering exists over the entire interaction time even if the steering modes are in very noisy thermal states. When the steered mode is initially in a thermal state, it can be collectively steered by the other modes. There are thresholds for the average number of the thermal photons above which the existing tripartite steering appears as the collective steering. Finally, we point out that the collective steering may provide a resource in a hybrid quantum network for quantum secret sharing protocol.

abstract: We study the optomechanical coupling of a oscillating effective mirror with a Rydberg atomic gas, mediated by the dynamical atom-mirror Casimir-Polder force. This coupling may produce a near-field resonant atomic excitation whose probability scales as $\propto (d^2\;a\;n^4\;t)^2/z_0^8$, where $z_0$ is the average atom-surface distance, $d$ the atomic dipole moment, $a$ the mirror's effective oscillation amplitude, $n$ the initial principal quantum number, and $t$ the time. We propose an experimental configuration to realize this system with a cold atom gas trapped at a distance $\sim 2\cdot10 \, \mu$m from a semiconductor substrate, whose dielectric constant is periodically driven by an external laser pulse, hence realizing en effective mechanical mirror motion due to the periodic change of the substrate from transparent to reflecting. For a parabolic gas shape, this effect is predicted to excite about $\sim 10^2$ atoms of a dilute gas of $10^3$ trapped Rydberg atoms with $n=75$ after about $0.5 \,\mu \mbox{s}$, hence high enough to be detected in typical Rydberg gas experimental conditions.

abstract: We present a formalism for simulating quantum dynamics of lattice spin-one systems by first introducing local hidden variables and then doing semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation in the extended phase space. In this way we exactly take into account the local on-site Hamiltonian and approximately treat spin-spin interactions. In particular, we represent each spin with eight classical SU(3) variables. Three of them represent the usual spin components and five others are hidden variables representing local spin-spin correlations. We compare our formalism with exact quantum dynamics of fully connected spin systems and find very good agreement. As an application we discuss quench dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model near the superfluid-insulator transition for a 3D lattice system consisting of 1000 sites.

abstract: Two-photon interference effects, such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, can be used to characterize to what extent two photons are identical. Identical photons are necessary for both linear optics quantum computing and single-photon quantum cryptography. We study here how storage and delay of photons in coupled cavity arrays, which inevitably will lead to changes in the photons' spectral and temporal profiles, affects their HOM interference. In addition we consider various types of entanglement that occur naturally in such a context.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions, in the form of a family of linear inequalities, which the spectrum has to verify. Our conditions become explicit when one of the two subsystems is a qubit, as well as for further sets of states. Finally, we introduce a family of simple entanglement criteria for spectra, closely related to the reduction and positive partial transpose criteria, which also provide new insight into the set of spectra that guarantee separability or positivity of the partial transpose.

We also discuss an application to the categorical theory of signal-flow networks.

abstract: We present a quantum communication experiment conducted over a point-to-point free-space link of 1.6 km in urban conditions. We study atmospheric influences on the capability of the link to act as a continuous-variable (CV) quantum channel. Continuous polarization states (that contain the signal encoding as well as a local oscillator in the same spatial mode) are prepared and sent over the link in a polarization multiplexed setting. Both signal and local oscillator undergo the same atmospheric fluctuations. These are intrinsically auto-compensated which removes detrimental influences on the interferometric visibility. At the receiver, we measure the Q-function and interpret the data using the framework of effective entanglement. We compare different state amplitudes and alphabets (two-state and four-state) and determine their optimal working points with respect to the distributed effective entanglement. Based on the high entanglement transmission rates achieved, our system indicates the high potential of atmospheric links in the field of CV QKD.

abstract: We report on the realization of Bose-Einstein condensation of metastable helium-4. After exciting helium to its metastable state in a novel pulse-tube cryostat source, the atomic beam is collimated and slowed. We then trap several 10^8 atoms in a magneto-optical trap. For subsequent evaporative cooling, the atoms are transferred into a magnetic trap. Degeneracy is achieved with typically a few 10^6 atoms. For detection of atomic correlations with high resolution, an ultrafast delay-line detector has been installed. Consisting of four quadrants with independent readout electronics that allow for true simultaneous detection of atoms, the detector is especially suited for quantum correlation experiments that require the detection of correlated subsystems. We expect our setup to allow for the direct demonstration of momentum entanglement in a scenario equivalent to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen gedanken experiment. This will pave the way to matter-wave experiments exploiting the peculiarities of quantum correlations.

abstract: Bragg diffraction is comparable to a hard-wall reflection if the Bragg condition is exactly fulfilled. However, in a neutron interferometer in the gravitational field (COW experiment) this is not the case and the momentum transfers should not be described by hard wall reflection, as it has been done in the commented article. Instead, and quite similar to the atom case, each mirror or beam splitter creates a constant momentum transfer given by the reciprocal lattice vector of the Bragg crystal. To lowest order there are no differences between the atom and the neutron case.

abstract: Combining high and low probability densities in intensity hybrids, we study some of their properties in double-slit setups. In particular, we connect to earlier results on beam attenuation techniques in neutron interferometry and study the effects of very small transmission factors, or very low counting rates, respectively, at one of the two slits. We use a "superclassical" modeling procedure which we have previously shown to produce predictions identical with those of standard quantum theory. Although in accordance with the latter, we show that there are previously unexpected new effects in intensity hybrids for transmission factors below $a\lesssim 10^{-4}$, which can eventually be observed with the aid of weak measurement techniques. We denote these as quantum sweeper effects, which are characterized by the bunching together of low counting rate particles within very narrow spatial domains. We give an explanation of this phenomenology by the circumstance that in reaching down to ever weaker channel intensities, the nonlinear nature of the probability density currents becomes ever more important, a fact which is generally not considered - although implicitly present - in standard quantum mechanics.

abstract: Scalability from single qubit operations to multi-qubit circuits for quantum information processing requires architecture-specific implementations. Semiconductor hybrid qubit architecture is a suitable candidate to realize large scale quantum information processing, as it combines a universal set of logic gates with fast and all-electrical manipulation of qubits. We propose an implementation of hybrid qubits, based on Si Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots, compatible with the CMOS industrial technologic standards. We discuss the realization of multi-qubit circuits capable of fault-tolerant computation and quantum error correction, by evaluating the time and space resources needed for their implementation. As a result, the maximum density of quantum information is extracted from a circuit including 8 logical qubits encoded by the [[7,1,3]] Steane code. The corresponding surface density of logical qubits is 2.6 Mqubit/cm$^2$.

abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) play an important role in many-body systems. However, investigating the QPT physics in a conventional condensed matter setup is limited by inadequacy in experimental control. Artificial atoms, such as superconducting qubits that can be individually manipulated, provide a new paradigm of realizing and exploring QPTs by building an on-chip quantum simulator. Here we demonstrate an experiment of simulating the quantum critical behaviour in a highly-controllable solid-state circuit, consisting of four qubits weakly coupled to a common resonator mode. By off-resonantly driving the system to renormalize the critical spin-field coupling strength, we have observed the normal-to-superradiant QPT, in excellent agreement with the driven Tavis-Cummings theory. Our achievement of a QPT with a low spin-field coupling offers new experimental approaches towards exploring QPT related science in the thermodynamic limit, such as scaling behaviour, parity breaking and long-range quantum correlations.

abstract: Fermionic linear optics is a model of quantum computation which is efficiently simulable on a classical probabilistic computer. We study the problem of a classical simulation of fermionic linear optics augmented with noisy auxiliary states. If the auxiliary state can be expressed as a convex combination of pure Fermionic Gaussian states, the corresponding computation scheme is classically simulable. We present an analytic characterisation of the set of convex-Gaussian states in the first non-trivial case, in which the Hilbert space of the ancilla is a four-mode Fock space. We use our result to solve an open problem recently posed by De Melo et al. and to study in detail the geometrical properties of the set of convex-Gaussian states.

abstract: Suppose that two distant parties Alice and Bob share an entangled state $\rho_{AB}$, and they want to exchange the subsystems of $\rho_{AB}$ by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In general, this LOCC task (i.e. the LOCC transformation of $\rho_{AB} \to V\rho_{AB} V$ with $V$ being a swap operator) is impossible deterministically, but becomes possible probabilistically. In this paper, we study how the optimal probability is related to the amount of entanglement in the framework of positive partial transposed (PPT) operations, and show a remarkable class of states whose probability is the smallest among every state in two quantum bits. This might give a candidate for the most asymmetric entanglement.

Quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG), which is an important feature for applications in quantum information science, was experimentally certified for the first time in frequency up-converted states.

abstract: We study the photon statistics of symmetric and antisymmetric modes in a photonic molecule consisting of two linearly coupled nonlinear cavity modes. Our calculations show that strong photon antibunching of both symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be obtained even when the nonlinearity in the photonic molecule is weak. The strong antibunching effect results from the destructive interference between different paths for two-photon excitation. Moreover, we find that the optimal frequency detunings for strong photon antibunching in the symmetric and antisymmetric modes are linearly dependent on the coupling strength between the cavity modes in the photonic molecule. This implies that the photonic molecules can be used to generate tunable single-photon sources by tuning the values of the coupling strength between the cavity modes with weak nonlinearity.

This latter effect can be seen as an inelastic generalization of the Hong--Ou--Mandel effect.

abstract: We present a general theory for calculating the damping rate of elementary density wave excitations in a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to a single radiation field mode of an optical cavity. Thereby we give a detailed derivation of the huge resonant enhancement in the Beliaev damping of a density wave mode, predicted recently by K\'onya et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 89, 051601(R) (2014). The given density-wave mode constitutes the polariton-like soft mode of the self-organization phase transition. The resonant enhancement takes place, both in the normal and ordered phases, outside the critical region. We show that the large damping rate is accompanied by a significant frequency shift of this polariton mode. Going beyond the Born-Markov approximation and determining the poles of the retarded Green's function of the polariton, we reveal a strong coupling between the polariton and a collective mode in the phonon bath formed by the other density wave modes.

We derive a {\em nonlocal duality relation}, ${\mathcal D}_1^2 + {\mathcal V}_2^2 \le 1$, which connects the path distinguishability of one particle to the interference visibility of the other. It extends Bohr's principle of complementarity to a nonlocal scenario. We also propose a {\em ghost quantum eraser} in which, erasing the which-path information of one particle brings back the interference fringes of the other.

abstract: Over the past three decades, quantum mechanics has allowed the development of technologies that provide unconditionally secure communication. In parallel, the quantum nature of the transverse electromagnetic field has spawned the field of quantum imaging that encompasses technologies such as quantum ghost imaging and high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The emergence of such quantum technologies also highlights the need for the development of methods for characterizing the elusive quantum state itself. In this document, we describe new technologies that use the quantum properties of light for security. The first is a technique that extends the principles behind QKD to the field of imaging. By applying the polarization-based BB84 protocol to individual photons in an active imaging system, we obtained images that are secure against intercept-resend jamming attacks. The second technology presented in this article is based on an extension of quantum ghost imaging. We used a holographic filtering technique to build a quantum ghost image identification system that uses a few pairs of photons to identify an object from a set of known objects. The third technology addressed in this document is a high-dimensional QKD system that uses orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) modes of light for encoding. Moving to a high-dimensional state space in QKD allows one to impress more information on each photon, as well as introduce higher levels of security. We discuss the development of two OAM-QKD protocols based on the BB84 and Ekert QKD protocols. The fourth and final technology presented in this article is a relatively new technique called direct measurement that uses sequential weak and strong measurements to characterize a quantum state. We use this technique to characterize the quantum state of a photon with a dimensionality of d=27, and measure its rotation in the natural basis of OAM.

For two-level systems, it is shown that any preparation violating complementarity enables the preparation of a non-signalling box violating Tsirelson s bound. Moreover, these superquantum objects could be used to distinguish a plethora of non-orthogonal quantum states and hence enable improved cloning protocols. For higher-dimensional systems the main ideas are briefly sketched.

We show that the non-Markovian stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation can be efficiently implemented as a real--time simulation for this model, so as to give an accurate description of spin-boson dynamics beyond the rotating-wave approximation.

abstract: As the energy relaxation time of superconducting qubits steadily improves, non-equilibrium quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting gap emerge as an increasingly relevant limit for qubit coherence. We measure fluctuations in the number of quasiparticle excitations by continuously monitoring the spontaneous quantum jumps between the states of a fluxonium qubit, in conditions where relaxation is dominated by quasiparticle loss. Resolution on the scale of a single quasiparticle is obtained by performing quantum non-demolition projective measurements within a time interval much shorter than $T_1$, using a quantum limited amplifier (Josephson Parametric Converter). The quantum jumps statistics switches between the expected Poisson distribution and a non-Poissonian one, indicating large relative fluctuations in the quasiparticle population, on time scales varying from seconds to hours. This dynamics can be modified controllably by injecting quasiparticles or by seeding quasiparticle-trapping vortices by cooling down in magnetic field.

abstract: We present measurements of a topological property, the Chern number ($C_\mathrm{1}$), of a closed manifold in the space of two-level system Hamiltonians, where the two-level system is formed from a superconducting qubit. We manipulate the parameters of the Hamiltonian of the superconducting qubit along paths in the manifold and extract $C_\mathrm{1}$ from the nonadiabitic response of the qubit. By adjusting the manifold such that a degeneracy in the Hamiltonian passes from inside to outside the manifold, we observe a topological transition $C_\mathrm{1} = 1 \rightarrow 0$. Our measurement of $C_\mathrm{1}$ is quantized to within 2 percent on either side of the transition.

abstract: Following J.-Y.B\'eziau in his pioneer work on non-standard interpretations of the traditional square of opposition, we have applied the abstract structure of the square to study the relation of opposition between states in superposition in orthodox quantum mechanics in \cite{are14}. Our conclusion was that such states are \ita{contraries} (\ita{i.e.} both can be false, but both cannot be true), contradicting previous analyzes that have led to different results, such as those claiming that those states represent \ita{contradictory} properties (\ita{i. e.} they must have opposite truth values). In this chapter we bring the issue once again into the center of the stage, but now discussing the metaphysical presuppositions which underlie each kind of analysis and which lead to each kind of result, discussing in particular the idea that superpositions represent potential contradictions. We shall argue that the analysis according to which states in superposition are contrary rather than contradictory is still more plausible.

abstract: We discuss the idea that superpositions in quantum mechanics may involve contradictions or contradictory properties. A state of superposition such as the one comprised in the famous Schr\"odinger's cat, for instance, is sometimes said to attribute contradictory properties to the cat: being dead and alive at the same time. If that were the case, we would be facing a revolution in logic and science, since we would have one of our greatest scientific achievements showing that real contradictions exist. We analyze that claim by employing the traditional square of opposition. We suggest that it is difficult to make sense of the idea of contradiction in the case of quantum superpositions. From a metaphysical point of view the suggestion also faces obstacles, and we present some of them.

abstract: The exchange splitting energy $J$ of the lowest \emph{gerade} and \emph{ungerade} states of the H$_2^+$ molecular ion was calculated using a volume integral expression of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory and standard basis set techniques of quantum chemistry. The performance of the proposed expression was compared to the well known surface integral formula. Both formulas involve the primitive function which we calculated employing either the Hirschfelder-Silbey perturbation theory or the conventional Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory (the polarization expansion). Our calculations show that very accurate values of $J$ can be obtained using the proposed volume integral formula. When the Hirschfelder-Silbey primitive function is used in both formulas the volume formula gives much more accurate results than the surface integral expression. We also show that using the volume integral formula with the primitive function approximated by Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, one correctly obtains only the first four terms in the asymptotic expansion of the exchange splitting energy.

abstract: We discuss how basic Clifford algebra and indeed all of matrix algebra and matrix representations of finite groups comes from Iterants: very elementary processes such as an alternation of plus and minus one ...+-+-+- .... One can think of the square root of minus one as a temporal iterant, a product of an A and a B where the A is the ...+-+-+-... and the B is a time shift operator. We have AA = BB =1 and AB + BA = 0, whence (AB)(AB) = -1. Clifford algebra is at the base of the (mathematical) world and the Fermions are composed of these things. We discuss the diagrammatics and topology of Majorana Fermions and we discuss the structure of the Dirac equation and how nilpotent and Majorana operators arise naturally in this context. We end the paper with an expression in split quaternions (in iterant form) for the the Majorana Dirac equation in one dimension of time and three dimensions of space.

abstract: We study the distinguishability norms associated to families of locally restricted POVMs on multipartite systems. These norms (introduced by Matthews, Wehner and Winter) quantify how quantum measurements, subject to locality constraints, perform in the task of discriminating two multipartite quantum states. We mainly address the following question regarding the behaviour of these distinguishability norms in the high-dimensional regime: On a bipartite space, what are the relative strengths of standard classes of locally restricted measurements? We show that the class of PPT measurements typically performs almost as well as the class of all measurements whereas restricting to local measurements and classical communication, or even just to separable measurements, implies a substantial loss. We also provide examples of state pairs which can be perfectly distinguished by local measurements if (one-way) classical communication is allowed between the parties, but very poorly without it. Finally, we study how many POVMs are needed to distinguish almost perfectly any pair of states on $\mathbf{C}^d$, showing that the answer is $\exp(\Theta(d^2))$.

abstract: In this work we study an optomechanical system in which there is a purely quadratic optomechanical coupling between the optical and mechanical modes. The optical mode is pumped by three coherent fields and the mechanical mode is parametrically driven. We show that if the frequencies and amplitudes of both optical and mechanical drivings are properly chosen, the optomechanical interaction gives rise to an effective interaction, which, in the presence of optical damping and in the absence of mechanical damping, has the squeezed vacuum state and the squeezed one phonon state as dark states of the dynamics. These states are well known for presenting quadrature squeezing and sub-Poissonian statistics. However, even in the presence of mechanical damping it is possible to find steady states with large degrees of quadrature squeezing or strong sub-Poissonian statistics. Furthermore, we find a counter-intuitive behavior in which a nonzero temperature of the mechanical environment allows the observation of mechanical states with more pronounced sub-Poissonian statistics.

abstract: We develop a method for approximate synthesis of single--qubit rotations of the form $e^{-i f(\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_k)X}$ that is based on the Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) framework for quantum circuit synthesis. We demonstrate how smooth computable functions $f$ can be synthesized from two basic primitives. This synthesis approach constitutes a manifestly quantum form of arithmetic that differs greatly from the approaches commonly used in quantum algorithms. The key advantage of our approach is that it requires far fewer qubits than existing approaches: as a case in point, we show that using as few as $3$ ancilla qubits, one can obtain RUS circuits for approximate multiplication and reciprocals. We also analyze the costs of performing multiplication and inversion on a quantum computer using conventional approaches and find that they can require too many qubits to execute on a small quantum computer, unlike our approach.

abstract: We consider the information flow on a system's observable $X$ corresponding to a positive-operator valued measure under a quantum measurement process $Y$ described by a completely positive instrument from the viewpoint of the relative entropy. We establish a sufficient condition for the relative-entropy conservation law which states that the averaged decrease in the relative entropy of the system's observable $X$ equals the relative entropy of the measurement outcome of $Y$, i.e. the information gain due to measurement. This sufficient condition is interpreted as an assumption of classicality in the sense that there exists a sufficient statistic in a joint successive measurement of $Y$ followed by $X$ such that the probability distribution of the statistic coincides with that of a single measurement of $X$ for the pre-measurement state. We show that in the case when $X$ is a discrete projection-valued measure and $Y$ is discrete, the classicality condition is equivalent to the relative-entropy conservation for arbitrary states. The general theory on the relative-entropy conservation is applied to typical quantum measurement models, namely quantum non-demolition measurement, destructive sharp measurements on two-level systems, a photon counting, a quantum counting, homodyne and heterodyne measurements. These examples except for the non-demolition and photon-counting measurements do not satisfy the known Shannon-entropy conservation law proposed by Ban~(M. Ban, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. \textbf{32}, 1643 (1999)), implying that our approach based on the relative entropy is applicable to a wider class of quantum measurements.

abstract: We give an algorithm which produces a unique element of the Clifford group C_n on n qubits from an integer 0\le i < |C_n| (the number of elements in the group). The algorithm involves O(n^3) operations. It is a variant of the subgroup algorithm by Diaconis and Shahshahani which is commonly applied to compact Lie groups. We provide an adaption for the symplectic group Sp(2n,F_2) which provides, in addition to a canonical mapping from the integers to group elements g, a factorization of g into a sequence of at most 4n symplectic transvections. The algorithm can be used to efficiently select randomelements of C_n which is often useful in quantum information theory and quantum computation. We also give an algorithm for the inverse map, indexing a group element in time O(n^3).

abstract: Controlling the flow of light by means of nanophotonic waveguides has the potential of transforming integrated information processing much in the same way that conventional glass fibers have revolutionized global communication. Owing to the strong transverse confinement of the light, such waveguides give rise to a coupling between the internal spin of the guided photons and their orbital angular momentum. Here, we employ this spin-orbit coupling of light to break the mirror symmetry of the scattering of light by a single gold nanoparticle on the surface of a nanophotonic waveguide. We thereby realize a chiral waveguide coupler in which the handedness of the incident light determines the direction of propagation in the waveguide. Using this effect, we control the directionality of the scattering process and direct up to 94% of the incoupled light into a given direction. This enables novel ways for controlling and manipulating light in optical waveguides and nanophotonic structures as well as for the design of integrated optical sensors.

abstract: In Quantum Physics it is not always possible to directly perform the measurement of an obsevable; in some of these cases, however, its value can be {\sl detected}, i.e. it can be inferred by measuring {\sl another} observable characterized by perfect correlation with the observable of interest. Though a {\sl detection} is often interpreted as a {\sl measurement} of the detected observable, we prove that the two concepts cannot be identified in Quantum Physics. Furthermore, we establish what meaning and role can be ascribed to detections coherently with Quantum Theory.

abstract: It has been recently shown that probabilistic protocols based on postselection boost the performances of phase estimation and the replication of quantum clocks. Here we demonstrate that the improvements in these two tasks have to match exactly in the macroscopic limit where the number of clones grows to infinity, preserving the equivalence between asymptotic cloning and estimation for arbitrary values of the success probability. Remarkably, the cloning fidelity depends critically on the number of rationally independent eigenvalues of the clock Hamiltonian. We also prove that probabilistic metrology can simulate cloning in the macroscopic limit for arbitrary sets of states, provided that the performance of the simulation is measured by testing small groups of clones.

abstract: A general theory is presented to describe optomechanical interactions of acoustic phonons, having extremely long lifetimes in superfluid $^4$He, with optical photons in the medium placed in a suitable electromagnetic cavity. The acoustic nonlinearity in the fluid motion is included to consider processes beyond the usual linear process involving absorption or emission of one phonon at a time. We first apply our formulation to the simplest one-phonon process involving the usual resonant anti-Stokes upconversion of an incident optical mode. However, when the allowed optical cavity modes are such that there is no single-phonon mode in the superfluid which can give rise to a resonant allowed anti-Stokes mode, we must consider the possibility of two phonon upconversion. For such a case, we show that the two step two phonon process could be dominant. We present arguments for large two step process and negligible single step two phonon contribution. The two step process also shows interesting quantum interference among different transition pathways.

abstract: The quantum-to-classical transition of a quantum state is a topic of great interest in fundamental and practical aspects. A coarse-graining in quantum measurement has recently been suggested as its possible account in addition to the usual decoherence model. We here investigate the reconstruction of a Gaussian state (single mode and two modes) by coarse-grained homodyne measurements. To this aim, we employ two methods, the direct reconstruction of the covariance matrix and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), respectively, and examine the reconstructed state under each scheme compared to the state interacting with a Gaussian (squeezed thermal) reservoir. We clearly demonstrate that the coarse-graining model, though applied equally to all quadrature amplitudes, is not compatible with the decoherence model by a thermal (phase-insensitive) reservoir. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the direct reconstruction and the MLE methods by investigating the fidelity and the nonclassicality of the reconstructed states and show that the MLE method can generally yield a more reliable reconstruction, particularly without information on a reference frame (phase of input state).

abstract: The parametrized Dirac wave equation for multiple particles is shown here to yield the standard cross sections for creation and annihilation of fermion pairs, while avoiding the paradoxes arising from the standard single-particle Dirac equation and hole theory. These paradoxes were originally overcome with Quantum Field Theory. The creation and annihilation operators of Quantum Field Theory are subject to causality conditions which preclude entanglement across distances greater than the order of the Compton wavelength. The parametrized first-quantized formalism requires no causality condition for fermions, and it admits fermion entanglement across all of space and time, while ensuring covariant Dyson series and ${\mathcal TPC}$ invariance.

abstract: We introduce a new framework for constructing topological quantum memories, by recasting error recovery as a dynamical process on a cellular automaton. We envisage quantum systems controlled by a classical hardware composed of small local memories, communicating with neighbors, and repeatedly performing identical simple update rules. This approach does not require any global operations or complex decoding algorithms. Our cellular automata draw inspiration from classical field theories, with a Coulomb-like potential naturally emerging from the local dynamics. For a 3D automaton coupled to a 2D toric code, we present evidence of an error correction threshold above 6.1% for uncorrelated noise. A 2D automaton equipped with a more complex update rule yields a threshold above 8.2%. Our framework provides decisive new tools in the quest for realizing a passive dissipative quantum memory.

In the end, we propose two simple experiments to visualize decoherence and to test the role of an entagled particle.

abstract: Superconducting qubits, while promising for scalability and long coherence times, contain more than two energy levels, and therefore are susceptible to errors generated by the leakage of population outside of the computational subspace. Such leakage errors constitute a prominent roadblock towards fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) with superconducting qubits. FTQC using topological codes is based on sequential measurements of multiqubit stabilizer operators. Here, we first propose a leakage-resilient procedure to perform repetitive measurements of multiqubit stabilizer operators, and then use this scheme as an ingredient to develop a leakage-resilient approach for surface code quantum error correction with superconducting circuits. Our protocol is based on swap operations between data and ancilla qubits at the end of every cycle, requiring read-out and reset operations on every physical qubit in the system, and thereby preventing persistent leakage errors from occurring.

abstract: The possibility of the superradiant phase transition in polarizable materials described by the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian with the longitudinal dipole-dipole interaction is examined. We try to reduce the Hamiltonian into the Dicke one in homogeneous and infinite case, and discuss the stability of normal ground state by the formalism of Green function in spatially inhomogeneous case. The presence of the longitudinal dipole-dipole interaction does not enable the superradiant phase transition, if the transverse and longitudinal fields are decoupled. Although the full dipole-dipole interaction can be eliminated in the electric-dipole gauge in the absence of overlap between individual atomic dipoles, we cannot reduce the Hamiltonian to the Dicke one, because the elimination is justified only if all the transverse and longitudinal fields remain. Even if the transverse and longitudinal fields are mixed in spatially inhomogeneous systems, the normal ground state is still stable if the system does not show the superradiant phase transition in the homogeneous case.

abstract: We show that violation of genuine multipartite Bell inequalities can be obtained with sampled, probabilistic phase space methods. These genuine Bell violations cannot be replicated if any part of the system is described by a local hidden variable theory. The Bell violations are simulated probabilistically using quantum phase-space representations. We treat mesoscopically large Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states having up to 60 qubits, using both a multipartite SU(2) Q-representation and the positive P-representation. Surprisingly, we find that sampling with phase-space distributions can be exponentially faster than experiment. This is due to the classical parallelism inherent in the simulation of quantum measurements using phase-space methods. Our probabilistic sampling method predicts a contradiction with local realism of "Schr\"odinger-cat" states that can be realized as a GHZ spin state, either in ion traps or with photonic qubits. We also present a quantum simulation of the observed super-decoherence of the ion-trap "cat" state, using a phenomenological noise model.

Here we show that the qubit distributions with the environment are essential for a thorough analysis, and demonstrate that the way that quantum correlations are distributed in a quantum register is constrained by the way in which each subsystem gets correlated with the environment. For a two-qubit system coupled to a common dissipative environment $\mathcal{E}$, we show how to optimise interqubit correlations and entanglement via a quantification of the qubit-environment information flow, in a process that, perhaps surprisingly, does not rely on the knowledge of the state of the environment. To illustrate our findings, we consider an optically-driven bipartite interacting qubit $AB$ system under the action of $\mathcal{E}$. By tailoring the light-matter interaction, a relationship between the qubits early stage disentanglement and the qubit-environment entanglement distribution is found. We also show that, under suitable initial conditions, the qubits energy asymmetry allows the identification of physical scenarios whereby qubit-qubit entanglement minima coincide with the extrema of the $A\mathcal{E}$ and $B\mathcal{E}$ entanglement oscillations.

abstract: We present a quantum algorithm to simulate general finite dimensional Markovian processes without the requirement of engineering the system-environment interactions. The proposed method consists in the quantum computation of the dissipative corrections to the unitary evolution of the system of interest, via the reconstruction of the response function associated with the Lindblad operators. Our approach is equally applicable to dynamics generated by effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We confirm the quality of our method providing specific error bounds that quantify its accuracy.

abstract: We present novel methods to numerically address the problem of characterizing the response of particle detectors in curved spacetimes. These methods allow for the integration of the Wightman function, at least in principle, in rather general backgrounds. In particular we will use this tool to further understand the nature of conformal massless scalar Hawking radiation from a Schwarzschild black hole in anti-de Sitter space. We do that by studying an Unruh-DeWitt detector at rest above the horizon and in circular geodesic orbit. The method allows us to see that the response rate shows peaks at certain characteristic frequencies, which correspond to the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the space-time. It is in principle possible to apply these techniques to more complicated and interesting physical scenarios, e.g. geodesic infall or multiple detector entanglement evolution, or the study of the behaviour of quantum correlations in spacetimes with black hole horizons.

abstract: Topological quantum computing promises error-resistant quantum computation without active error correction. However, there is a worry that during the process of executing quantum gates by braiding anyons around each other, extra anyonic excitations will be created that will disorder the encoded quantum information. Here we explore this question in detail by studying adiabatic code deformations on Hamiltonians based on topological codes, notably Kitaev's surface codes and the more recently discovered color codes. We develop protocols that enable universal quantum computing by adiabatic evolution in a way that keeps the energy gap of the system constant with respect to the computation size and introduces only simple local Hamiltonian interactions. This allows one to perform holonomic quantum computing with these topological quantum computing systems. The tools we develop allow one to go beyond numerical simulations and understand these processes analytically.

abstract: Accurately describing work extraction from a quantum system is a central objective for the extension of thermodynamics to individual quantum systems. The concepts of work and heat are surprisingly subtle when generalizations are made to arbitrary quantum states. We formulate an operational thermodynamics suitable for application to an open quantum system undergoing quantum evolution under a general quantum process by which we mean a completely-positive and trace-preserving map. We derive an operational first law of thermodynamics for such processes and show consistency with the second law. We show that heat, from the first law, is positive when the input state of the map majorises the output state. Moreover, the change in entropy is also positive for the same majorisation condition. This makes a strong connection between the two operational laws of thermodynamics.

Using the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian of the correlated system, the corresponding approximate ground-state energy $E_p$ is then calculated. The optimization-search performed on $E_p$ with such restricted informations has a robust performance and results in the exact ($ex$) ground-state energy for the correlated model system $E_p=E_{ex}$.

abstract: We consider a method of remote mixed state creation of a one-qubit subsystem (receiver) in a spin-1/2 chain governed by the nearest-neighbor $XY$-Hamiltonian. Owing to the evolution of the chain along with the variable local unitary transformation of the one- or two-qubit sender, a large variety of receiver states can be created during some time interval starting with a fixed initial state of the whole quantum system. These states form the creatable region of the receiver's state-space. It is remarkable that, having the two-qubit sender, a large creatable region may be covered at a properly fixed time instant $t_0$ using just the variable local unitary transformation of the sender. In this case we have completely local control of the remote state creation. In general, for a given initial state, there are such receiver's states that may not be created using the above tool. These states form the unavailable region. In turn, this unavailable region might be the creatable region of another sender. Thus, in future, we have a way to share the whole receiver's state-space among the creatable regions of several senders. The effectiveness of remote state creation is characterized by the density function of the creatable region.

abstract: The photon-number distribution between two parts of a given volume is found for an arbitrary photon statistics. This problem is related to the interaction of a light beam with a macroscopic device, for example a diaphragm, that separates the photon flux into two parts with known probabilities. To solve this problem, a Generalized Binomial Distribution (GBD) is derived that is applicable to an arbitrary photon statistics satisfying probability convolution equations. It is shown that if photons obey Poisson statistics then the GBD is reduced to the ordinary binomial distribution, whereas in the case of Bose-Einstein statistics the GBD is reduced to the Polya distribution. In this case, the photon spatial distribution depends on the phase-space volume occupied by the photons. This result involves a photon bunching effect, or collective behavior of photons that sharply differs from the behavior of classical particles. It is shown that the photon bunching effect looks similar to the quantum interference effect.

abstract: Topological quantum computation started as a niche area of research aimed at employing particles with exotic statistics, called anyons, for performing quantum computation. Soon it evolved to include a wide variety of disciplines. Advances in the understanding of anyon properties inspired new quantum algorithms and helped in the characterisation of topological phases of matter and their experimental realisation. The conceptual appeal of topological systems as well as their promise for building fault-tolerant quantum technologies fuelled the fascination in this field. This `focus on' brings together several of the latest developments in the field and facilitates the synergy between different approaches.

abstract: We apply quantum optimal control theory (QOCT) to an exactly solvable non-Markovian open quantum bit (qubit) system to achieve state-independent quantum control and construct high-fidelity quantum gates for moderate qubit decaying parameters. An important quantity, improvement $\mathcal{I}$, is proposed and defined to quantify the correction of gate errors due to the QOCT iteration when the environment effects are taken into account. With the help of the exact dynamics, we explore how the gate error is corrected in the open qubit system and determine the conditions for significant improvement. The model adopted in this paper can be implemented experimentally in realistic systems such as the circuit QED system.

Resorting to the Lie-Hopf structure of these algebras, that shows how the Bose-Einstein statistics for identical bosons is correctly given in the su(1,1) framework, we prove that quantization of Maxwell's equations leads to su(1,1), relativistic covariance being naturally recognized as an internal symmetry of this dynamical algebra. Moreover su(1,1) rather than h(1) coordinates are associated to circularly polarized electromagnetic waves. As for interacting bosons, the su(1,1) formulation of the Jaynes-Cummings model is discussed, showing its advantages over h(1).

abstract: We revisit a fundamental open problem in quantum information theory, namely whether it is possible to transmit quantum information at a rate exceeding the channel capacity if we allow for a non-vanishing probability of decoding error. Here we establish that the Rains information of any quantum channel is a strong converse rate for quantum communication: For any code with a rate exceeding the Rains information of the channel, we show that the fidelity vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. This remains true even if we consider codes that perform classical post-processing on the transmitted quantum data. Our result has several applications. Most importantly, for generalized dephasing channels we show that the Rains information is also achievable, and thereby establish the strong converse property for quantum communication over such channels. This for the first time conclusively settles the strong converse question for a class of quantum channels that have a non-trivial quantum capacity. Moreover, we show that the classical post-processing assisted quantum capacity of the quantum binary erasure channel satisfies the strong converse property.

abstract: We analyze the error of approximating Gibbs states of local quantum spin Hamiltonians on lattices with Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) as a function of the bond dimension ($D$), temperature ($\beta^{-1}$), and system size ($N$). First, we introduce a compression method in which the bond dimension scales as $D=e^{O(\log^2(N/\epsilon))}$ if $\beta<O(\log (N))$. Second, building on the work of Hastings [Phys. Rev. B 73, 085115 (2006)], we derive a polynomial scaling relation, $D=\left(N/\epsilon\right)^{O(\beta)}$. This implies that the manifold of PEPS forms an efficient representation of Gibbs states of local quantum Hamiltonians. From those bounds it also follows that ground states can be approximated with $D=N^{O(\log(N))}$ whenever the density of states only grows polynomially in the system size. All results hold for any spatial dimension of the lattice.

abstract: A theoretical model of the influence of detection bandwidth properties on observed line shapes in laser absorption spectroscopy is described. The model predicts artificial frequency shifts, extra broadenings and line asymmetries which must be taken into account in order to obtain accurate central frequencies and other spectroscopic parameters. This reveals sources of systematic effects most probably underestimated so far potentially affecting spectroscopic measurements. This may impact many fields of research, from atmospheric and interstellar physics to precision spectroscopic measurements devoted to metrological applications, tests of quantum electrodynamics or other fundamental laws of nature. Our theoretical model is validated by linear absorption experiments performed on H2O and NH3 molecular lines recorded by precision laser spectroscopy in two distinct spectral regions, near- and mid-infrared. Possible means of recovering original line shape parameters or experimental conditions under which the detection bandwidth has a negligible impact, given a targeted accuracy, are proposed. Particular emphasis is put on the detection bandwidth adjustments required to use such high-quality molecular spectra for a spectroscopic determination of the Boltzmann constant at the 1 ppm level of accuracy.

abstract: Triplet excitonic state in the organic molecule may arise from a singlet excitation and the following inter-system crossing. Especially for a spin-bearing molecule, an exchange interaction between the triplet exciton and the original spin on the molecule can be expected. In this paper, such exchange interaction in copper-phthalocyanine (CuPc, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$) was investigated from first-principles by using density-functional theory within a variety of approximations to the exchange correlation, ranging from local-density approximation to long-range corrected hybrid-exchange functional. The magnitude of the computed exchange interaction is in the order of meV with the minimum value (1.5 meV, ferromagnetic) given by the long-range corrected hybrid-exchange functional CAM-B3LYP. This exchange interaction can therefore give rise to a spin coherence with an oscillation period in the order of picoseconds, which is much shorter than the triplet lifetime in CuPc (typically tens of nanoseconds). This implies that it might be possible to manipulate the localised spin on Cu experimentally using optical excitation and inter-system crossing well before the triplet state disappears.

abstract: In quantum theory, a physical observable is represented by a Hermitian operator as it admits real eigenvalues. This stems from the fact that any measuring apparatus that is supposed to measure a physical observable will always yield a real number. However, reality of eigenvalue of some operator does not mean that it is necessarily Hermitian. There are examples of non-Hermitian operators which may admit real eigenvalues under some symmetry conditions. One may wonder if there is any way to measure a non-Hermitian operator, for example, the average of a non-Hermitian operator in a quantum state. We show that quantum theory allows direct measurement of any non-Hermitian operator via the weak measurement. The average of a non-Hermitian operator in a pure state is a complex multiple of the weak value of the positive semi-definite part of the non-Hermitian operator. We also prove a new uncertainty relation for any two non-Hermitian operators and illustrate this for the creation and annihilation operators, and the Kraus operators.

abstract: Recently, the problem of secure position-verification has been extensively analyzed in a formal notion where distant verifiers send encrypted challenge along with the decryption information to the prover. However, currently it is known that all the existing position-verification scheme are insecure and secure positioning is impossible. We propose here a different notion for position-verification where distant verifiers determine the actions of the prover through non-local correlations generated by local measurements at the provers site. The proposed scheme guarantees secure positioning even if the verifiers do not have any pre-shared data with the prover, position is the only credential of the prover. Our proposed scheme is secure in general and evades known quantum attacks based on instantaneous non-local computations in particular. The scheme enables verifiers to identify dishonest provers with very high probability , where n is the number of entangled pairs used.

Leading proposals for fault-tolerant quantum computation require codes with an exceedingly rare property, a transverse non-Clifford gate. Codes with the desired property are presented for $d$-level, qudit, systems with prime $d$. The codes use $n=d-1$ qudits and can detect upto $\sim d/3$ errors. We quantify the performance of these codes for one approach to quantum computation, known as magic state distillation. Unlike prior work, we find performance is always enhanced by increasing $d$.

As an application of the dichromatic calculus, we depict a quantum algorithm with a single qutrit. Since it is not easy to decompose an arbitrary d by d unitary matrix into Z and X phase gates when d > 2, the proof of the universality of qudit ZX calculus for quantum mechanics is far from trivial. We construct a counterexample to Ranchin's universality proof, and give another proof by Lie theory that the qudit ZX calculus contains all single qudit unitary transformations, which implies that qudit ZX calculus, with qutrit dichromatic calculus as a special case, is universal for quantum mechanics.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Quantum paradoxes show that quantum statistics can exceed the limits of positive joint probabilities for physical properties that cannot be measured jointly. It is therefore impossible to describe the relations between the different physical properties of a quantum system by assigning joint realities to their observable values. Recent progress in quantum measurements suggests that the fundamental relations between non-commuting physical properties can instead be described by complex probabilities, where the phase is an expression of the action of transformations between the non-commuting properties (Hofmann H F 2011 New J. Phys. 13 103009). In these relations, negative probabilities necessarily emerge whenever the physical properties involved are related to each other by half-periodic transformations, since such transformations are characterized by action phases of pi in their complex probabilities. It is therefore possible to trace the failure of realist assumptions back to a fundamental and universally valid relation between statistics and dynamics that associates half-periodic transformations with negative probabilities.

abstract: Contextuality is a central property in comparative analysis of classical, quantum, and supercorrelated systems. We examine and compare two well-motivated approaches to contextuality. One approach (contextuality-by-default) is based on the idea that one and the same physical property measured under different conditions (contexts) is represented by different random variables: the contextuality in a system is measured by minimizing the probabilities with which random variables representing one and the same physical property in different contexts can attain unequal values in a joint distribution imposed on all the random variables by which the system is described. The other approach is based on the idea that while a physical property is represented by a single random variable irrespective of its context, the joint distributions of the random variables describing the system can involve negative (quasi-)probabilities: the contextuality is measured by minimizing the sum of the absolute values of all the probabilities. We show that in the Leggett-Garg and EPR-Bell systems, two important cases where contextuality appears in physics, the two measures essentially coincide, although for more complex systems they may not determine each other uniquely.

abstract: Bohmian mechanics provides an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of point particles guided by wave functions. This review focuses on the formalism of non-relativistic Bohmian mechanics, rather than its interpretation. Although the Bohmian and standard quantum theories have different formalisms, both give exactly the same predictions for all phenomena. Fifteen years ago, the quantum chemistry community began to study the practical usefulness of Bohmian mechanics. Since then, the scientific community has mainly applied it to study the (unitary) evolution of single-particle wave functions, either by developing efficient quantum trajectory algorithms or by providing a trajectory-based explanation of complicated quantum phenomena. Here we present a large list of examples showing how the Bohmian formalism provides a useful solution in different forefront research fields for this kind of problems (where the Bohmian and the quantum hydrodynamic formalisms coincide). In addition, this work also emphasizes that the Bohmian formalism can be a useful tool in other types of (non-unitary and nonlinear) quantum problems where the influence of the environment or the global wave function are unknown. This review contains also examples on the use of the Bohmian formalism for the many-body problem, decoherence and measurement processes. The ability of the Bohmian formalism to analyze this last type of problems for (open) quantum systems remains mainly unexplored by the scientific community. The authors of this review are convinced that the final status of the Bohmian theory among the scientific community will be greatly influenced by its potential success in these type of problems that present non-unitary and/or nonlinear quantum evolutions. A brief introduction of the Bohmian formalism and some of its extensions are presented in the last part of this review.

abstract: The possibility of quantum interference of a composite object with many internal degrees of freedom is studied, such that the internal degrees play a role of an internal environment. In particular, if the internal degrees have a capacity for an irreversible record of which-path information, then the internal-environment induced decoherence prevents external experimentalists from observing interference. Interference can be observed only if the interfering object is sufficiently isolated from the external environment, so that the object cannot record which-path information. Extrapolation to a hypothetical interference experiment with a conscious object implies that being a Schrodinger cat would be like being an ordinary cat living in a box without any information about the world external to the box.

abstract: We propose and analyze the design of a programmable photonic integrated circuit for high-fidelity quantum computation and simulation. We demonstrate that the reconfigurability of our design allows us to overcome two major impediments to quantum optics on a chip: it removes the need for a full fabrication cycle for each experiment and allows for compensation of fabrication errors using numerical optimization techniques. Under a pessimistic fabrication model for the silicon-on-insulator process, we demonstrate a dramatic fidelity improvement for the linear optics CNOT and CPHASE gates and, showing the scalability of this approach, the iterative phase estimation algorithm built from individually optimized gates. We also propose and simulate a novel experiment that the programmability of our system would enable: a statistically robust study of the evolution of entangled photons in disordered quantum walks. Overall, our results suggest that existing fabrication processes are sufficient to build a quantum photonic processor capable of high fidelity operation.

abstract: We analyze the ultimate bounds on the phase sensitivity of an interferometer, given the constraint that the state input to the interferometer's initial 50:50 beamsplitter $B$ is a product state of the two input modes. Requiring a product state is a natural restriction: if one were allowed to input an arbitrary, entangled two-mode state $|\Xi\rangle$ to the beamsplitter, one could generally just as easily input the state $B|\Xi\rangle$ directly into the two modes after the beamsplitter, thus rendering the beamsplitter unnecessary. We find optimal states for a fixed photon number and for a fixed mean photon number.

abstract: Recently many simple principles have been proposed that can explain quantum limitations on possible sets of experimental probabilities in nonlocality and contextuality experiments. However, few implications between these principles are known. Here it is shown that lack of irreducible third-order interference (a generalisation of the idea that no probabilistic interference remains unaccounted for once we have taken into account interference between pairs of slits in a $n$-sit experiment) implies the principle known as the E principle or Consistent Exclusivity (that, if each pair of a set of experimental outcomes are exclusive alternatives in some measurement, then their probabilities are consistent with the existence of a further measurement in which they are all exclusive). This is a step towards a more unified understanding of quantum nonlocality and contextuality, which promises to allow derivations of important results from minimal, easily grasped assumptions. As one example, this result implies that lack of third order interference bounds violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality to 2.883.

abstract: Searching for non-Hermitian (parity-time)$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians \cite{bender} with real spectra has been acquiring much interest for fourteen years. In this article, we have introduced a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian model which is given as $\hat{\mathcal{H}}=\omega (\hat{b}^\dagger\hat{b}+\frac{1}{2})+ \alpha (\hat{b}^{2}-(\hat{b}^\dagger)^{2})$ where $\omega$ and $\alpha$ are real constants, $\hat{b}$ and $\hat{b^\dagger}$ are first order differential operators. Moreover, Pseudo-Hermiticity that is a generalization of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has been attracting a growing interest \cite{mos}. Because the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ is pseudo-Hermitian, we have obtained the Hermitian equivalent of $\mathcal{H}$ which is in Sturm- Liouville form leads to exactly solvable potential models which are effective screened potential and hyperbolic Rosen-Morse II potential. $\mathcal{H}$ is called pseudo-Hermitian, if there exists a Hermitian and invertible operator $\eta$ satisfying $\mathcal{H^\dagger}=\eta \mathcal{H} \eta^{-1}$. For the Hermitian Hamiltonian $h$, one can write $h=\rho \mathcal{H} \rho^{-1}$ where $\rho=\sqrt{\eta}$ is unitary. Using this $\rho$ we have obtained a physical Hamiltonian $h$ for each case. Then, the Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved exactly using Shape Invariance method of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics \cite{susy1}. Mapping function $\rho$ is obtained for each potential case.

Here we introduce Shimony-Wolf fields, entirely classical non-deterministic states, as a basis for entanglement and Bell analyses. Such fields are well known in coherence optics and are open to test. We present experimental results showing that Shimony-Wolf states exhibit strong classical Bell violation, in effect opening a way of examining a new sector of the boundary between quantum and classical physics.

abstract: One of the key challenges in quantum information is coherently manipulating the quantum state. However, it is an outstanding question whether control can be realized with low error. Only gates from the Clifford group -- containing $\pi$, $\pi/2$, and Hadamard gates -- have been characterized with high accuracy. Here, we show how the Platonic solids enable implementing and characterizing larger gate sets. We find that all gates can be implemented with low error. The results fundamentally imply arbitrary manipulation of the quantum state can be realized with high precision, providing new practical possibilities for designing efficient quantum algorithms.

abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are well-established techniques that provide valuable information in a diverse set of disciplines but are currently limited to macroscopic sample volumes. Here we demonstrate nanoscale NMR spectroscopy and imaging under ambient conditions of samples containing multiple nuclear species, using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) colour centres in diamond as sensors. With single, shallow NV centres in a diamond chip and samples placed on the diamond surface, we perform NMR spectroscopy and one-dimensional MRI on few-nanometre-sized samples containing $^1$H and $^{19}$F nuclei. Alternatively, we employ a high-density NV layer near the surface of a diamond chip to demonstrate wide-field optical NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale samples containing $^1$H, $^{19}$F, and $^{31}$P nuclei, as well as multi-species two-dimensional optical MRI with sub-micron resolution. For all diamond samples exposed to air, we identify a ubiquitous $^1$H NMR signal, consistent with a $\sim 1$ nm layer of adsorbed hydrocarbons or water on the diamond surface and below any sample placed on the diamond. This work lays the foundation for nanoscale NMR and MRI applications such as studies of single proteins and functional biological imaging with subcellular resolution, as well as characterization of thin films with sub-nanometre resolution.

abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a suddenly released beam of particles using a background independent (polymer) quantization scheme. We show that, in the first order of approximation, the low-energy polymer distribution converges to the standard quantum-mechanical result in a clear fashion, but also arises an additional small polymer correction term. We find that the high-energy polymer behaviour becomes predominant at short distances and short times. Numerical results are also presented. We find that particles whose wave functions satisfy the polymer wave equation do not exhibit the diffraction in time phenomena. The implementation of a lower bound to the possible resolution of times into the time-energy Heisenberg uncertainty relation is briefly discussed.

abstract: We propose a semantic representation of the standard quantum logic QL within a classical, normal modal logic, and this via a lattice-embedding of orthomodular lattices into Boolean algebras with one modal operator. Thus our classical logic is a completion of the quantum logic QL. In other words, we refute Birkhoff and von Neumann's classic thesis that the logic (the formal character) of Quantum Mechanics would be non-classical as well as Putnam's thesis that quantum logic (of his kind) would be the correct logic for propositional inference in general. The propositional logic of Quantum Mechanics is modal but classical, and the correct logic for propositional inference need not have an extroverted quantum character. One normal necessity modality suffices to capture the subjectivity of observation in quantum experiments, and this thanks to its failure to distribute over classical disjunction. The key to our result is the translation of quantum negation as classical negation of observability.

abstract: We provide a twofold extension of Landau--Pollak uncertainty relations for mixed quantum states and for positive operator-valued measures, by recourse to geometric considerations. The generalization is based on metrics between pure states, having the form of a function of the square of the inner product between the states. The triangle inequality satisfied by such metrics plays a crucial role in our derivation. The usual Landau--Pollak inequality is thus a particular case (derived from Wootters metric) of the family of inequalities obtained, and, moreover, we show that it is the most restrictive relation within the family.

abstract: It is found that the measurement disturbance relation (MDR) determines the strength of quantum correlation and hence is one of the essential facets of the nature of quantum nonlocality. In reverse, the exact form of MDR may be ascertained through measuring the correlation function. To this aim, an optical experimental scheme is proposed. Moreover, by virtue of the correlation function, we find that the quantum entanglement, the quantum non-locality, and the uncertainty principle can be explicitly correlated.

These results will inform the experimental programme of gravitational wave astronomy with cold atoms.

abstract: Quantum algorithms are known for presenting more efficient solutions to certain computational tasks than any corresponding classical algorithm. It has been thought that the origin of the power of quantum computation has its roots in non-classical correlations such as entanglement or quantum discord. However, it has been recently shown that even a single pure qudit is sufficient to design an oracle-based algorithm which solves a black-box problem faster than any classical approach to the same problem. In particular, the algorithm that we consider determines whether eight permutation functions defined on a set of four elements is positive or negative cyclic. While any classical solution to this problem requires two evaluations of the function, quantum mechanics allows us to perform the same task with only a single evaluation. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of the considered quantum algorithm with a quadrupolar nuclear magnetic resonance setup using a single four-level quantum system, i.e., a ququart.

We used a photon-number-resolving time-multiplexed detector based on a fiber-optical setup and a pair of avalanche photodiodes. By resorting to a germane data-pattern tomography, we assess the properties of the nonclassical light states states with unprecedented precision.

abstract: We present a method for preparing arbitrary pure states of spatial qudits, namely, D-dimensional (D > 2) quantum systems carrying information in the transverse momentum and position of single photons. For this purpose, a set of D slits with complex transmission are displayed on a spatial light modulator (SLM). In a recent work we have shown a method that requires a single phase-only SLM to control independently the complex coefficients which define the quantum state of dimension D. The amplitude information was codified by introducing phase gratings inside each slit and the phase value of the complex transmission was added to the phase gratings. After a spatial filtering process we obtained in the image plane the desired qudit state. Although this method has proven to be a good alternative to compact the previously reported architectures, it presents some features that could be improved. In this paper we present an alternative scheme to codify the required phase values that minimizes the effects of temporal phase fluctuations associated to the SLM where the codification is carried on. In this scheme the amplitudes are set by appropriate phase gratings addressed at the SLM while the relative phases are obtained by a lateral displacement of these phase gratings. We show that this method improves the quality of the prepared state and provides very high fidelities of preparation for any state. An additional advantage of this scheme is that a complete 2\pi modulation is obtained by shifting the grating by one period, and hence the encoding is not limited by the phase modulation range achieved by the SLM. Numerical simulations, that take into account the phase fluctuations, show high fidelities for thousands of qubit states covering the whole Bloch sphere surface. Similar analysis are performed for qudits with D = 3 and D = 7.

abstract: In this brief note, we compare two frameworks for characterizing possible operations in quantum thermodynamics. One framework considers Thermal Operations---unitaries which conserve energy. The other framework considers all maps which preserve the Gibbs state at a given temperature. Thermal Operations preserve the Gibbs state; hence a natural question which arises is whether the two frameworks are equivalent. Classically, this is true---Gibbs-Preserving Maps are no more powerful than Thermal Operations. Here, we show that this no longer holds in the quantum regime: a Gibbs-Preserving Map can generate coherent superpositions of energy levels while Thermal Operations cannot. This gap has an impact on clarifying a mathematical framework for quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum field tomography, the efficient and reliable reconstruction of unknown quantum fields based on data of correlation functions. At the basis of the analysis is the concept of continuous matrix product states, a complete set of variational states grasping states in quantum field theory. We innovate a practical method, making use of and developing tools in estimation theory used in the context of compressed sensing such as Prony methods and matrix pencils, allowing us to faithfully reconstruct quantum field states based on low-order correlation functions. In the absence of a phase reference, we highlight how specific higher order correlation functions can still be predicted. We exemplify the functioning of the approach by reconstructing randomised continuous matrix product states from their correlation data and study the robustness of the reconstruction for different noise models. We also apply the method to data generated by simulations based on continuous matrix product states and using the time-dependent variational principle. The presented approach is expected to open up a new window into experimentally studying continuous quantum systems, such as encountered in experiments with ultra-cold atoms on top of atom chips. By virtue of the analogy with the input-output formalism in quantum optics, it also allows for studying open quantum systems.

abstract: The experimental realisation of large scale many-body systems has seen immense progress in recent years, rendering full tomography tools for state identification inefficient, especially for continuous systems. In order to work with these emerging physical platforms, new technologies for state identification are required. In this work, we present first steps towards efficient experimental quantum field tomography. We employ our procedure to capture ultracold atomic systems using atom chips, a setup that allows for the quantum simulation of static and dynamical properties of interacting quantum fields. Our procedure is based on cMPS, the continuous analogues of matrix product states (MPS), ubiquitous in condensed-matter theory. These states naturally incorporate the locality present in realistic physical settings and are thus prime candidates for describing the physics of locally interacting quantum fields. The reconstruction procedure is based on two- and four-point correlation functions, from which we predict higher-order correlation functions, thus validating our reconstruction for the experimental situation at hand. We apply our procedure to quenched prethermalisation experiments for quasi-condensates. In this setting, we can use the quality of our tomographic reconstruction as a probe for the non-equilibrium nature of the involved physical processes. We discuss the potential of such methods in the context of partial verification of analogue quantum simulators.

The process includes doped active regions and metal interconnect layers, allowing for co-fabrication of standard CMOS circuitry as well as devices for optical control and measurement. With one of the interconnect layers defining a ground plane between the trap electrode layer and the p-type doped silicon substrate, ion loading is robust and trapping is stable. We measure a motional heating rate comparable to those seen in surface-electrode traps of similar size. This is the first demonstration of scalable quantum computing hardware, in any modality, utilizing a commercial CMOS process, and it opens the door to integration and co-fabrication of electronics and photonics for large-scale quantum processing in trapped-ion arrays.

abstract: In the traditional studies of the squeezing, the attention is focused mostly on the particular squeezed states and their evolution, less on the dynamical operations which could squeeze simultaneously some wider families of quantum states, independently of their initial shape. The paper below looks for new steps in this direction, achieved by softly acting electromagnetic fields which might produce the squeezing of the canonical $q,p$ observables of charged particles. If real, it may turn of interest for quantum tomography, as well as for the critical analysis of some fundamental quantum problems. It is also noticed that the most elementary case of the Toeplitz algebra provides much easier solutions of the operational problems than the recently applied Ermakov-Milne invariants.

We also show how the corresponding evolution operator can be approximated at all times by a very simple analytical expression. We propose this model as being specially suitable for treating periodic driving at avoided crossings found in complex multi-level systems, and thus show a relevant application of our results to designing a control protocol in a realistic molecular model

Changing the values of the parameters determining superlattices, we can switch the system between differently entangled states.

abstract: The current operational formulation of quantum theory is based on the concept of operation with an input and an output system, which assumes a prior notion of time and is asymmetric under time reversal. But in certain contexts, such as those involving gravity, time is expected to be dynamical and not predefined. Here, we propose an operational formulation of quantum theory without any predefined notion of time. It is based on a generalization of the concept of operation motivated by an epistemic approach: an operation is a description of knowledge about the events in a given region, which can be updated conditionally on information obtained from that region. Each such region has a set of boundary systems, which by definition provide the sole means of information exchange between the events in the region and the events in other regions. Separate operations can be connected in networks through their boundary systems with no directionality assumed for the connections, which generalizes the standard circuit picture. The events associated with an operation are described by positive semidefinite operators on the Hilbert spaces of the boundary systems, while the connections between regions are described by entangled states that encode a nontrivial physical symmetry. A simple rule provides the joint probabilities for the events in a network of operations. We discuss how it may be possible to understand the emergence of a causal structure from properties of the operators on the boundaries of compact space-time regions. The framework allows for indefinite causal order, timelike loops, and other acausal structures. As part of this work, we obtain a generalization of Wigner's theorem, which is based on the preservation of probabilities of actual events and thus puts the concept of time reversal symmetry on operational grounds. It contains the possibility for a new class of symmetry transformations.

abstract: Here we provide a scheme of transforming the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian into the two-axis twisting one based on high order Trotter-Suzuki Approximation. Compared with the paper [Y. C. Liu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 013601 (2011)], our method can reduce the number of controlling cycles from $1000$ to $50$. Moreover, it is also spin number independent and takes shorter optimal evolution time contrast with the method in the work [C. Shen et al., Phys. Rev. A 87, 051801 (2013)]. The corresponding error analysis is also provided.

abstract: Generally, the local interactions in a many-body quantum spin system on a lattice do not commute with each other. Consequently, the Hamiltonian of a local region will generally not commute with that of the entire system, and so the two cannot be measured simultaneously. The connection between the probability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global Hamiltonians will depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these two Hamiltonians. In this paper we characterize the relation between these two distributions. On one hand, we upperbound the probability of measuring an energy $\tau$ in a local region, if the global system is in a superposition of eigenstates with energies $\epsilon<\tau$. On the other hand, we bound the probability of measuring a global energy $\epsilon$ in a bipartite system that is in a tensor product of eigenstates of its two subsystems. Very roughly, we show that due to the local nature of the governing interactions, these distributions are identical to what one encounters in the commuting case, up to some exponentially small corrections. Finally, we use these bounds to study the spectrum of a locally truncated Hamiltonian, in which the energies of a contiguous region have been truncated above some threshold energy $\tau$. We show that the lower part of the spectrum of this Hamiltonian is exponentially close to that of the original Hamiltonian. A restricted version of this result in 1D was a central building block in a recent improvement of the 1D area-law.

abstract: Nonlinear optical processes are governed by the relative-phase relationships among the relevant electromagnetic fields in these processes. In this Letter, we describe the physics of arbitrary manipulation of nonlinear optical processes (AMNOP) by artificial control of relative phases. As a typical example, we show freely designable optical-frequency conversions to extreme spectral regions, mid-infrared and vacuum-ultraviolet, with near-unity quantum efficiencies. Furthermore, we show that such optical-frequency conversions can be realized by using a surprisingly simple technology where transparent plates are placed in a nonlinear optical medium and their positions and thicknesses are adjusted precisely. In a numerical experiment assuming practically applicable parameters in detail, we demonstrate a single-frequency tunable laser that covers the whole vacuum-ultraviolet spectral range of 120 to 200 nm.

abstract: Many work extraction or information erasure processes in the literature involve the raising and lowering of energy levels via external fields. But even if the actual system is treated quantum mechanically, the field is assumed to be classical and of infinite strength, hence not developing any correlations with the system or experiencing back-actions. We extend these considerations to a fully quantum mechanical treatment, by studying a spin-1/2 particle coupled to a finite-sized directional quantum reference frame, a spin-l system, which models an external field. With this concrete model together with a bosonic thermal bath, we analyse the back-action a finite-size field suffers during a quantum-mechanical work extraction process, the effect this has on the extractable work, and highlight a range of assumptions commonly made when considering such processes. The well-known semi-classical treatment of work extraction from a pure qubit predicts a maximum extractable work W = kT log 2 for a quasi-static process, which holds as a strict upper bound in the fully quantum mechanical case, and is only attained in the classical limit. We also address the problem of emergent local time-dependence in a joint system with globally fixed Hamiltonian.

abstract: Since the 1990s, there has been a dramatic interest in quantum communication. Free-space quantum communication is being developed to ultra-long distance quantum experiment, which requires higher electronics performance, such as time measurement precision, data-transfer rate, and system integration density. As part of the ground station of quantum experiment satellite that will be launched in 2016, we specifically designed a compact PCI-based multi-channel electronics system with high time-resolution, high data-transfer-rate. The electronics performance of this system was tested. The time bin size is 23.9ps and the time precision root-mean-square (RMS) is less than 24ps for 16 channels. The dead time is 30ns. The data transfer rate to local computer is up to 35 MBps, and the count rate is up to 30M/s. The system has been proven to perform well and operate stably through a test of free space quantum key distribution (QKD) experiment.

abstract: In the pursuit of realizing quantum optical networks, a large variety of different approaches have been studied to achieve a single photon source on-demand. The common goal for these approaches is to harvest all the emission from a quantum emitter into a single spatial optical mode while maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we use a single nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a quantum emitter operating at ambient conditions and we demonstrate an increased photon count rate up to a factor of 1.76 by placing a silver mirror fabricated on the end facet of an optical fiber near the emitter.

abstract: Hidden-variable models aim to reproduce the results of quantum theory and to satisfy our classical intuition. Their refutation is usually based on deriving predictions that are different from those of quantum mechanics. Here instead we study the mutual compatibility of apparently reasonable classical assumptions. We analyze a version of the delayed-choice experiment which ostensibly combines determinism, independence of hidden variables on the conducted experiments, and wave-particle objectivity (the assertion that quantum systems are, at any moment, either particles or waves, but not both). These three ideas are incompatible with any theory, not only with quantum mechanics.

abstract: We demonstrate atomic filtering of frequency-degenerate photon pairs from a sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The filter, a modified Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (FADOF), achieves 70% peak transmission simultaneous with 57 dB out-of-band rejection and a 445 MHz transmission bandwidth. When applied to the OPO output, only the degenerate mode, containing one-mode squeezed vacuum, falls in the filter pass-band; all other modes are strongly suppressed. The high transmission preserves non-classical continuous-variable features, e.g. squeezing or non-gaussianity, while the high spectral purity allows reliable discrete-variable detection and heralding. Correlation and atomic absorption measurements indicate a spectral purity of 96% for the individual photons, and 98% for the photon pairs. These capabilities will enable generation of atom-resonant hybrid states, e.g. "Schr\"odinger kittens" obtained by photon subtraction from squeezed vacuum, making these exotic states available for quantum networking and atomic quantum metrology applications.

The process of weak measurement has been utilized for the the estimation of the timescale. The temperature dependence of the Zeno time has been shown. From the calculation it is evident that the Zeno time decreases with the increase of temperature. Moreover, the result restricts the Zeno time to a maximum limiting value, irrespective of how frequent is the measurement process.

It is shown that this symmetry allows three dipole transitions which eventually leads to six possible configurations of the four-level system. Using a dressed atom approach, the semi-classical version of each configuration is exactly solved under rotating wave approximation and the symmetry of the Rabi oscillation among various models is studied and its implication is discussed.

abstract: We investigate quantum beats in the arrival-time distribution of single photons from a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion, revealing their fundamentally different physical origins in two distinct experimental situations: In a $\Lambda$-type level scheme the interference of two 854-nm absorption amplitudes suppresses and enhances the emission process of Raman-scattered 393-nm photons; in a V-type level scheme the interference of two 393-nm emission amplitudes causes a rotation of their dipole emission pattern resulting in a temporal modulation of the detected photons. For both cases we demonstrate coherent control over the quantum-beat phase through the phases of the atomic and photonic input states, which also allows controlled adjustment of the total photon detection efficiency.

abstract: Quantum Communications on planetary scale require complementary channels including ground and satellite links. The former have progressed up to commercial stage using fiber-cables, while for satellite links, the absence of terminals in orbit has impaired theirs development. However, the demonstration of the feasibility of such links is crucial for designing space payloads and to eventually enable the realization of protocols such as quantum-key-distribution (QKD) and quantum teleportation along satellite-to-ground or intersatellite links. We demonstrated the faithful transmission of qubits from space to ground by exploiting satellite corner cube retroreflectors acting as transmitter in orbit, obtaining a low error rate suitable for QKD. We also propose a two-way QKD protocol exploiting modulated retroreflectors that necessitates a minimal payload on satellite, thus facilitating the expansion of Space Quantum Communications.

abstract: We report direct measurement of population dynamics in the excited state manifold of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We quantify the phonon-induced mixing rate and demonstrate that it can be completely suppressed at low temperatures. Further, we measure the intersystem crossing (ISC) rate for different excited states and develop a theoretical model that unifies the phonon-induced mixing and ISC mechanisms. We find that our model is in excellent agreement with experiment and that it can be used to predict unknown elements of the NV center's electronic structure. We discuss the model's implications for enhancing the NV center's performance as a room-temperature sensor.

abstract: In attempting to derive irreversible macroscopic thermodynamics from reversible microscopic dynamics, Boltzmann inadvertently smuggled in a premise that assumed the very irreversibility he was trying to prove: 'molecular chaos.' The program of 'Einselection' (environmentally induced superselection) within Everettian approaches faces a similar 'Loschmidt's Paradox': the universe, according to the Everettian picture, is a closed system obeying only unitary dynamics, and it therefore contains no distinguishable environmental subsystems with the necessary phase randomness to effect einselection of a pointer observable. The theoretically unjustified assumption of distinguishable environmental subsystems is the hidden premise that makes the derivation of einselection circular. In effect, it presupposes the 'emergent' structures from the beginning. Thus the problem of basis ambiguity remains unsolved in Everettian interpretations.

abstract: The coherent manipulation of the atomic matter waves is of great interest both in science and technology. In order to study how an atom optic device alters the coherence of an atomic beam, we consider the quantum lens proposed by Averbukh et al [1] to show the discrete nature of the electromagnetic field. We extend the analysis of this quantum lens to the study of another essentially quantum property present in the focusing process, i.e., the atom-field entanglement, and show how the initial atomic coherence and purity are affected by the entanglement. The dynamics of this process is obtained in closed form. We calculate the beam quality factor and the trace of the square of the reduced density matrix as a function of the average photon number in order to analyze the coherence and purity of the atomic beam during the focusing process.

abstract: In this work, we address some important topological and algebraic aspects of two-qudit states evolving under local unitary operations. The projective invariant subspaces and evolutions are connected with the common elements characterizing the su(d) Lie algebra and their representations. In particular, the roots and weights turn out to be natural quantities to parametrize cyclic evolutions and fractional phases. This framework is then used to recast the coset contribution to the geometric phase in a form that generalizes the usual monopole-like formula for a single qubit.

The resulting code is a $[[O(L^3),1,O(L^{\frac{4}{3}})]]$ stabilizer code with an energy barrier of $O(L^{\frac{2}{3}})$, which is an exponential improvement over the previous highest energy barrier in 3-d. No-go results are avoided by breaking microscopic translation invariance.

abstract: We demonstrate a single-photon sensitive spectrometer in the visible range, which allows us to perform time-resolved and multi-photon spectral correlation measurements. It is based on a monochromator composed of two gratings, collimation optics and an array of single photon avalanche diodes. The time resolution can reach $110$ ps and the spectral resolution is $2$ nm/pixel, limited by the design of the monochromator. This technique can easily be combined with commercial monochromators, and can be useful for joint spectrum measurements of two photons emitted in the process of parametric down conversion, as well as time-resolved spectrum measurements in optical coherence tomography or medical physics applications.

abstract: Parametric down-conversion (PDC) is the established standard for the practical generation of a multiplicity of quantum optical states. These include two-mode squeezed vacuum, heralded non-Gaussian states and entangled photon pairs. Detailed theoretical studies provide insight into the time-frequency (TF) structure of PDC, which are governed by the complex-valued joint spectral amplitude (JSA) function. However in experiments, the TF structure of PDC is mostly characterised by intensity measurementsthat forbid access to the important phase of the JSA. In this paper, we present an amplitude-sensitive quantum process tomography technique that combines methods from ultrafast optics and classical three-wave mixing. Our approach facilitates a direct and phase-sensitive time-frequency tomography of PDC with high spectral resolution and excellent signal-to-noise ratio. This is important for all quantum optical applications, which rely on engineered parametric processes and base on minute knowledge of the quantum wave-function for the generation of tailored photonic quantum states.

We use this result to propose the use of entangled photons to emulate the evolution of gravitational waves in curved spacetimes by means of experimental electromagnetic setups featuring metamaterials.

abstract: The ability to engineer photon emission and photon scattering is at the heart of modern photonics applications ranging from light harvesting, through novel compact light sources, to quantum-information processing based on single photons. Nanophotonic waveguides are particularly well suited for such applications since they confine photon propagation to a 1D geometry thereby increasing the interaction between light and matter. Adding chiral functionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling integrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel topological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates photons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are reverse processes. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures where a non-transversal local electric field implies that both photon emission and scattering may become directional. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the internal state of a quantum emitter determines the chirality of single-photon emission in a specially engineered photonic-crystal waveguide. Single-photon emission into the waveguide with a directionality of more than 90\% is observed under conditions where practically all emitted photons are coupled to the waveguide. Such deterministic and highly directional photon emission enables on-chip optical diodes, circulators operating at the single-photon level, and deterministic quantum gates. Based on our experimental demonstration, we propose an experimentally achievable and fully scalable deterministic photon-photon CNOT gate, which so far has been missing in photonic quantum-information processing where most gates are probabilistic.

abstract: The duality principle, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, limits the coexistence of wave and particle behaviours of quantum systems. This limitation takes a quantitative form when applied to the visibility $\mathcal V$ and predictability $\mathcal P$ within a two-alternative system, which are bound by the inequality $\mathcal V^2+ \mathcal P^2 \leq 1$. However, if such a system is coupled to its environment, it becomes possible to obtain conditional measures of visibility and predictability, i.e.~measures that are conditional on the state of the environment. We show that in this case, the predictability and visibility values can lead to an apparent violation of the duality principle. We experimentally realize this apparent violation in a controlled manner by enforcing a fair-sampling-like loophole via postselection. Given the ability to simultaneously obtain high predictability information and high visibility interference fringes for a wide range of coupling strengths and postselected states, this work highlights the role of fair-sampling in tests of the duality principle.

abstract: In quantum key distribution implementations, each session is typically chosen long enough so that the secret key rate approaches its asymptotic limit. However, this choice may be constrained by the physical scenario, as in the perspective use with satellites, where the passage of one terminal over the other is restricted to a few minutes. Here we demonstrate experimentally the extraction of secure keys leveraging an optimal design of the prepare-and-measure scheme, according to recent finite-key theoretical tight-bounds. The experiment is performed in different channel conditions, and assuming two distinct attack models: individual attacks, or general quantum attacks. The request on the number of exchanged qubits is then obtained as a function of the key size and of the ambient quantum bit error rate. The results indicate that viable conditions for effective symmetric, and even one-time-pad, cryptography are achievable.

A corollary of this result is that disjunction can be implemented exactly in constant-depth, answering an open question of H{\o}yer and \v{S}palek.

abstract: Quantum data locking is a protocol that allows for a small secret key to (un)lock an exponentially larger amount of information, hence yielding the strongest violation of the classical one-time pad encryption in the quantum setting. This violation mirrors a large gap existing between two security criteria for quantum cryptography quantified by two entropic quantities: the Holevo information and the accessible information. We show that the latter becomes a sensible security criterion if an upper bound on the coherence time of the eavesdropper's quantum memory is known. Under this condition we introduce a protocol for secret key generation through a memoryless qudit channel. For channels with enough symmetry, such as the d-dimensional erasure and depolarizing channels, this protocol allows secret key generation at an asymptotic rate as high as the classical capacity minus one bit.

For this reason, at the conclusion of our book where the subject is treated across different disciplines, we have asked Mel Levy and Elliott Lieb to provide us with some open problems, which they believe will be a worth challenge for the future also in the perspective of a synergy among the various disciplines.

abstract: Quipper is a recently released quantum programming language. In this report, we explore Quipper's programming framework by implementing the Deutsch's, Deutsch-Jozsa's, Simon's, Grover's, and Shor's factoring algorithms. It will help new quantum programmers in an instructive manner. We choose Quipper especially for its usability and scalability though it's an ongoing development project. We have also provided introductory concepts of Quipper and prerequisite backgrounds of the algorithms for readers' convenience. We also have written codes for oracles (black boxes or functions) for individual algorithms and tested some of them using the Quipper simulator to prove correctness and introduce the readers with the functionality. As Quipper 0.5 does not include more than \ensuremath{4 \times 4} matrix constructors for Unitary operators, we have also implemented \ensuremath{8 \times 8} and \ensuremath{16 \times 16} matrix constructors.

abstract: We study quantum tomography based on a stochastic continuous-time measurement record obtained from a probe field collectively interacting with an ensemble of identically prepared systems. In comparison to previous studies, we consider here the case in which the measurement-induced backaction has a nonnegligible effect on the dynamical evolution of the ensemble. We formulate a maximum likelihood estimate for the initial quantum state given only a single instance of the continuous diffusive measurement record. We apply our estimator to the simplest problem -- state tomography of a single pure qubit, which, during the course of the measurement, is also subjected to dynamical control. We identify a regime where the many-body system is well approximated at all times by a separable pure spin coherent state, whose Bloch vector undergoes a conditional stochastic evolution. We simulate the results of our estimator and show that we can achieve close to the upper bound of fidelity set by the optimal POVM. This estimate is compared to, and significantly outperforms, an equivalent estimator that ignores measurement backaction.

abstract: Certain continuous-time quantum walks can be viewed as scattering processes. These processes can perform quantum computations, but it is challenging to design graphs with desired scattering behavior. In this paper, we study and construct momentum switches, graphs that route particles depending on their momenta. We also give an example where there is no exact momentum switch, although we construct an arbitrarily good approximation.

abstract: Homogenization proposed in [Y.-C Wu and M. \.Zukowski, Phys. Rev. A 85, 022119 (2012)] is a procedure to transform a tight Bell inequality with partial correlations into a full-correlation form that is also tight. In this paper, we check the homogenizations of two families of $n$-partite Bell inequalities: the Hardy inequality and the tight Bell inequality without quantum violation. For Hardy's inequalities, their homogenizations bear stronger quantum violation for the maximally entangled state; the tight Bell inequalities without quantum violation give the boundary of quantum and supra-quantum, but their homogenizations do not have the similar properties. We find their homogenization are violated by the maximally entangled state. Numerically computation shows the the domains of quantum violation of homogenized Hardy's inequalities for the generalized GHZ states are smaller than those of Hardy's inequalities.

abstract: We investigate electrode geometries required to produce periodic 2-dimensional ion-trap arrays with the ions placed between two planes of electrodes. We present a generalization of previous methods for traps containing a single electrode plane to this new geometry, and show that for a given ion-electrode distance and applied voltages, the inter-ion distance can be reduced by a factor of up to 3 relative to single-plane traps. This represents an increase by a factor of 9 in the trap density and a factor of 27 in the exchange coupling between the oscillatory motion of neighboring ions. The resulting traps are also considerably deeper for bi-layer structures than for single-plane traps. These results could offer a useful path towards 2-dimensional ion arrays for quantum simulation. We also discuss issues with the fabrication of such traps.

abstract: Employing the quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians for the collective and internal subsystems with a linear coupling, we studied the role of fermionic statistics on the dynamics of the collective motion. The transport coefficients are discussed as well as the associated fluctuation-dissipation relation. Due to different nature of the particles, the path to equilibrium is slightly affected. However, in the weak coupling regime, the time-scale for approaching equilibrium is found to be globally unchanged. The Pauli-blocking effect can modify the usual picture in open quantum system. In some limits, contrary to boson, this effect can strongly hinder the influence of the bath by blocking the interacting channels.

Unlike the usual double-well, here the closely lying sub-barrier doublets need not be the lowest ones in the spectrum. When $V_0$ admits certain calculable values, $E=0$ or $E=V_0$ or both could become energy eigenvalues of the special eigenstate which emerge only if one seeks a linear solution of Schr{\"o}dinger equation in the appropriate regions.

abstract: We consider systems of two and three qubits, mutually coupled by Heisenberg-type exchange interaction and interacting with external laser fields. We show that these systems allow one to create maximally entangled Bell states, as well as three qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states. In particular, we point out that some of the target states are the eigenstates of the initial bare system. Due to this, one can create entangled states by means of pulse area and adiabatic techniques, when starting from a separable (non-entangled) ground state. On the other hand, for target states, not present initially in the eigensystem of the model, we apply the robust stimulated Raman adiabatic passage and $\pi$ pulse techniques, that create desired coherent superpositions of non-entangled eigenstates.

abstract: The celebrating theorem of A. Fine implies that the CHSH inequality is violated if and only if the joint probability distribution for the quadruples of observables involved the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment does not exist, i.e., it is impossible to use the classical probabilistic model (Kolmogorov, 1933). In this note we demonstrate that, in spite of Fine's theorem, the results of observations in the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment can be described in the classical probabilistic framework. However, the "quantum probabilities" have to be interpreted as conditional probabilities, where conditioning is with respect to fixed experimental settings. Our approach is based on the complete account of randomness involved in the experiment. The crucial point is that randomness of selections of experimental settings has to be taken into account. This approach can be applied to any complex experiment in which statistical data are collected for various (in general incompatible) experimental settings. Finally, we emphasize that our construction of the classical probability space for the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment cannot be used to support the hidden variable approach to the quantum phenomena. The classical random parameter $\omega$ involved in our considerations cannot be identified with the hidden variable $\lambda$ which is used the Bell-type considerations.

abstract: We consider a circuit-QED setup that allows the induction and control of non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit. Non-Markovianity is enforced over the qubit by means of its direct coupling to a bosonic mode which is controllably coupled to other qubit-mode system. We show that this configuration can be achieved in a circuit-QED setup consisting of two initially independent superconducting circuits, each formed by one charge qubit and one transmission-line resonator, which are put in interaction by coupling the resonators to a current-biased Josephson junction. We solve this problem exactly and then proceed with a thorough investigation of the emergent non-Markovianity in the dynamics of the qubits. Our study might serve the context for a first experimental assessment of non-Markovianity in a multi-element solid-state device.

abstract: We provide a familiy of transparent tight-binding models with non-trivial potentials and site-dependent hopping parameters. Their feasibility is discussed in electromagnetic resonators, dielectric slabs and quantum-mechanical traps. In the second part of the paper, the arrays are obtained through a generalization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics in discrete variables. The formalism includes a finite-difference Darboux transformation applied to the scattering matrix of a periodic array. A procedure for constructing a hierarchy of discrete hamiltonians is indicated and a particular biparametric family is given. The corresponding potentials and hopping functions are identified as solitary waves, pointing to a discrete spinorial generalization of the Korteweg-deVries family.

abstract: The simulation of molecules is a widely anticipated application of quantum computers. However, recent studies \cite{WBCH13a,HWBT14a} have cast a shadow on this hope by revealing that the complexity in gate count of such simulations increases with the number of spin orbitals $N$ as $N^8$, which becomes prohibitive even for molecules of modest size $N\sim 100$. This study was partly based on a scaling analysis of the Trotter step required for an ensemble of random artificial molecules. Here, we revisit this analysis and find instead that the scaling is closer to $N^6$ in worst case for real model molecules we have studied, indicating that the random ensemble fails to accurately capture the statistical properties of real-world molecules. Actual scaling may be significantly better than this due to averaging effects. We then present an alternative simulation scheme and show that it can sometimes outperform existing schemes, but that this possibility depends crucially on the details of the simulated molecule. We obtain further improvements using a version of the coalescing scheme of \cite{WBCH13a}; this scheme is based on using different Trotter steps for different terms. The method we use to bound the complexity of simulating a given molecule is efficient, in contrast to the approach of \cite{WBCH13a,HWBT14a} which relied on exponentially costly classical exact simulation.

abstract: Entangled multi-photon states have the potential to provide improved measurement accuracy, but are sensitive to photon loss. It is possible to calculate ideal loss-resistant states that maximize the Fisher information, but it is unclear how these could be experimentally generated. Here we propose a set of states that can be obtained by processing the output from parametric down-conversion. Although these states are not optimal, they provide performance very close to that of optimal states for a range of parameters. Moreover, we show how to use sequences of such states in order to obtain an unambiguous phase measurement that beats the standard quantum limit. We consider the optimization of parameters in order to minimize the final phase variance, and find that the optimum parameters are different from those that maximize the Fisher information.

abstract: Fault-tolerant Z rotations by pi/2^k are important as they arise in numerous quantum algorithms, most notably those involving quantum Fourier transforms. We describe surface code implementations of two recently described methods of efficiently constructing these rotations. One method uses state distillation to get low-error (|0> + exp(i pi/2^k)|1>)/sqrt(2) states, with each distillation level requiring 2^(k+2)-1 input states to produce a single purer output state, and uses these distilled states to directly implement pi/2^k angle Z rotations. The other method is indirect, using sequences of single-qubit Clifford and T gates. We compute and compare the overhead of our surface code implementations of these two techniques. We find that the approximating sequence overhead is less than or equal to direct distillation for k > 3 and logical error rates <~ 10^-12.

Denote by $\{{ F}_s: s=1,2\ldots, k\}$ the set of all minimal cycles of $\pi$ and $l(\pi)=\max\{\# { F}_s: s=1,2,\ldots,k\}$ the length of $\pi$. It is shown that the Hermitian matrix $W_{n,t,\pi}$ induced by $\Phi_{n,t,\pi}$ is an indecomposable entanglement witness if and only if $\pi^2\not={\rm id}$ (the identity permutation) and $0<t\leq\frac{n}{l(\pi)}$. Some new bounded entangled states are detected by such witnesses that cannot be distinguished by PPT criterion, realignment criterion, etc..

abstract: It is known that any two-outcome quantum measurement can be decomposed into a continuous stochastic process using a feedback loop. In this article, we characterize which of these decompositions are possible when each iteration of the feedback loop consists of a weak measurement caused by an interaction with a probe system. We restrict ourselves to the case when the probe is a qubit and the interaction Hamiltonian between the probe and system is constant. We find that even given the ability to perform arbitrary unitary pulses throughout the continuous decomposition, only generalized measurements with two distinct singular values are achievable. However, this is sufficient to decompose a generalized qubit measurement using a qubit probe and a simple interaction Hamiltonian.

abstract: An approach, called discretized environment method, is introduced to treat exactly non-Markovian effects in open quantum systems. In this approach, a complex environment described by a spectral function is mapped into a finite set of discretized states with an appropriate coupling to the system of interest. The finite set of system plus environment degrees of freedom are then explicitly followed in time leading to a quasi-exact description. The present approach is anticipated to be particularly accurate in the low temperature and strongly non-Markovian regime. The discretized environment method is validated on a two-level system (qubit) coupled to a bosonic or fermionic heat bath. A perfect agreement with the quantum Langevin approach is found. Further illustrations are made on a three-level system (qutrit) coupled to a bosonic heat-bath. Emerging processes due to strong memory effects are discussed.

This property suggests to view Wave Mechanics as a direct, causal and realistic, extension of Classical Mechanics, based on exact trajectories and motion laws of point-like particles "piloted" by de Broglie's matter waves and avoiding the probabilistic content and the wave-packets both of the standard Copenhagen interpretation and of Bohm's theory.

Our model is exactly diagonalisable when the overlap of the quasilocalized modes in each well is small enough with respect to the trap asymmetry. For larger overlaps or highly symmetric traps, our diagonalisable Hamiltonian acquires extra terms that we treat within perturbation theory.

abstract: We present the NMR implementation of a recently proposed quantum algorithm to find the parity of a permutation. In the usual qubit model of quantum computation, speedup requires the presence of entanglement and thus cannot be achieved by a single qubit. On the other hand, a qutrit is qualitatively more quantum than a qubit because of the existence of quantum contextuality and a single qutrit can be used for computing. We use the deuterium nucleus oriented in a liquid crystal as the experimental qutrit. This is the first experimental exploitation of a single qutrit to carry out a computational task.

abstract: Quantum correlations can be stronger than anything achieved by classical systems, yet they are not reaching the limit imposed by relativity. The principle of information causality offers a possible explanation for why the world is quantum and why there appear to be no even stronger correlations. Generalizing the no-signaling condition it suggests that the amount of accessible information must not be larger than the amount of transmitted information. Here we study this principle experimentally in the classical, quantum and post-quantum regimes. We simulate correlations that are stronger than allowed by quantum mechanics by exploiting the effect of polarization-dependent loss in a photonic Bell-test experiment. Our method also applies to other fundamental principles and our results highlight the special importance of anisotropic regions of the no-signalling polytope in the study of fundamental principles.

abstract: The problem of using observed correlations to infer causal relations is relevant to a wide variety of scientific disciplines. Yet given correlations between just two classical variables, it is impossible to determine whether they arose from a causal influence of one on the other or a common cause influencing both, unless one can implement a randomized intervention. We here consider the problem of causal inference for quantum variables. We introduce causal tomography, which unifies and generalizes conventional quantum tomography schemes to provide a complete solution to the causal inference problem using a quantum analogue of a randomized trial. We furthermore show that, in contrast to the classical case, observed quantum correlations alone can sometimes provide a solution. We implement a quantum-optical experiment that allows us to control the causal relation between two optical modes, and two measurement schemes -- one with and one without randomization -- that extract this relation from the observed correlations. Our results show that entanglement and coherence, known to be central to quantum information processing, also provide a quantum advantage for causal inference.

abstract: In this paper, we discuss the connection between two genuinely quantum phenomena --- the discontinuity of quantum maximum entropy inference and quantum phase transitions at zero temperature. It is shown that the discontinuity of the maximum entropy inference of local observable measurements signals the non-local type of transitions, where local density matrices of the ground state change smoothly at the transition point. We then propose to use the quantum conditional mutual information of the ground state as an indicator to detect the discontinuity and the non-local type of quantum phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: Quantum discord is a measure of quantum correlations beyond the entanglement-separability paradigm. It is conceptualized by using the von Neumann entropy as a measure of disorder. We introduce a class of quantum correlation measures as differences between total and classical correlations, in a shared quantum state, in terms of the sandwiched relative Renyi and Tsallis entropies. We compare our results with those obtained by using the traditional relative entropies. We find that the measures satisfy all the plausible axioms for quantum correlations. We evaluate the measures for shared pure as well as paradigmatic classes of mixed states. We show that the measures can faithfully detect the quantum critical point in the transverse quantum Ising model. Furthermore, the measures provide better finite-size scaling exponents of the quantum critical point than the ones for other known order parameters, including entanglement and information-theoretic measures of quantum correlations.

abstract: We report on the selective addressing of an individual atom in a pair of single-atom microtraps separated by $3\;\mu$m. Using a tunable light-shift, we render the selected atom off-resonant with a global Rydberg excitation laser which is resonant with the other atom, making it possible to selectively block this atom from being excited to the Rydberg state. Furthermore we demonstrate the controlled manipulation of a two-atom entangled state by using the addressing beam to induce a phase shift onto one component of the wave function of the system, transferring it to a dark state for the Rydberg excitation light. Our results are an important step towards implementing quantum information processing and quantum simulation with large arrays of Rydberg atoms.

In a highly frustrated region, the system shows enhanced quantum fluctuations and entanglement characteristic of spin-liquid phases. We propose and describe within a mean-field approach a quantum annealing process to induce a quasi-adiabatic evolution towards the ground state.

abstract: The ultrastrong-coupling regime, where the atom-cavity coupling rate reaches a considerable fraction of the cavity or atom transition frequencies, has been reported in a flux qubit superconducting quantum circuit coupled to an on-chip coplanar resonator. This regime enables the possibility of manipulating the cavity quantum electrodynamic ground state with controllable physical properties and situations may arise where the resonator field $\hat X= \hat a+\hat a^\dagger$ acquires a nonzero expectation value in the system ground state. We demonstrate that in this case the parity symmetry of an additonal artificial atom with an even potential is broken by the interaction with the resonator. Such mechanism is in close analogy with the Higgs mechanism where the gauge symmetry of the weak force's gauge bosons is broken by the nonzero vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. The results here presented open the way to controllable experiments on symmetry breaking mechanisms induced by nonzero vacuum expectation values. Moreover the here proposed mechanism can be used as a probe of the ground state macroscopic coherence emerging from quantum phase transitions with vacuum degeneracy.

abstract: An optimal estimator of quantum states based on a modified Kalman Filter is presented in this work. Such estimator acts after state measurement, allowing to obtain an optimal estimation of quantum state resulting in the output of any quantum image algorithm. Besides, a new criteria, logic, and arithmetic based on projections onto vertical axis of Bloch Sphere exclusively are presented too. This approach will allow us: 1) a simpler development of logic and arithmetic quantum operations, where they will closer to those used in the classical digital image processing algorithms, 2) building simple and robust classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical interfaces. Said so far is extended to quantum algorithms outside image processing too. In a special section on metrics and simulations, three new metrics based on the comparison between the classical and quantum versions algorithms for filtering and edge detection of images are presented. Notable differences between the results of classical and quantum versions of such algorithms (outside and inside of quantum computer, respectively) show the need for modeling state and measurement noise inside estimation scheme.

abstract: We have introduced a measure of Gaussian quantum correlations based on quantum Fisher information. For bipartite Gaussian states the minimum quantum Fisher information due to local unitary evolution on one of the parties reliably quantifies quantum correlation. In quantum metrology the proposed measure becomes the tool to investigate the role of quantum orrelation in setting metrological precision. In particular, a deeper insights can be gained on how quantum correlations are instrumental to enhance metrological precision. Our analysis demonstrates that not only entanglement but also quantum correlation plays an important role to enhance metrological precision. Clearly unraveling the underlaying mechanism we show that quantum correlations, even in the absence of entanglement, can be exploited as the resource to beat standard quantum limit and attain Heisenberg limit in quantum metrology.

abstract: Individual impurity atoms in silicon can make superb individual qubits, but it remains an immense challenge to build a multi-qubit processor: There is a basic conflict between nanometre separation desired for qubit-qubit interactions, and the much larger scales that would enable control and addressing in a manufacturable and fault tolerant architecture. Here we resolve this conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing using solid state spins, or `data qubits', that are widely separated from one another. We employ a second set of `probe' spins which are mechanically separate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin dipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path. We introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being imperfectly located during device fabrication. Detailed simulations show that the surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are substantial on the scale of the array, indicating that it is very robust. We conclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the difficulties facing solid state quantum computing, while minimising the complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude greater than other systems.

abstract: Coherent interconversion between optical and mechanical excitations in an optomechanical cavity can be used to engineer a quantum heat engine. This heat engine is based on an Otto cycle between a cold photonic reservoir and a hot phononic reservoir [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 150602 (2014)]. Building on our previous work, we (i) develop a detailed theoretical analysis of the work and the efficiency of the engine, and (ii) perform an investigation of the quantum thermodynamics underlying this scheme. In particular, we analyze the thermodynamic performance in both the dressed polariton picture and the original bare photon and phonon picture. Finally, (iii) a numerical simulation is performed to derive the full evolution of the quantum optomechanical system during the Otto cycle, by taking into account all relevant sources of noise.

abstract: In textbooks, ideal quantum measurements are described in terms of the tested system only by the collapse postulate and Born's rule. This level of description offers a rather flexible position for the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Here we analyse an ideal measurement as a process of interaction between the tested system S and an apparatus A, so as to derive the properties postulated in textbooks. We thus consider within standard quantum mechanics the measurement of a quantum spin component $\hat s_z$ by an apparatus A, being a magnet coupled to a bath. We first consider the evolution of the density operator of S+A describing a large set of runs of the measurement process. The approach describes the disappearance of the off-diagonal terms ("truncation") of the density matrix as a physical effect due to A, while the registration of the outcome has classical features due to the large size of the pointer variable, the magnetisation. A quantum ambiguity implies that the density matrix at the final time can be decomposed on many bases, not only the one of the measurement. This quantum oddity prevents to connect individual outcomes to measurements, a difficulty known as the "measurement problem". It is shown that it is circumvented by the apparatus as well, since the evolution in a small time interval erases all decompositions, except the one on the measurement basis. Once one can derive the outcome of individual events from quantum theory, the so-called "collapse of the wave function" or the "reduction of the state" appears as the result of a selection of runs among the original large set. Hence nothing more than standard quantum mechanics is needed to explain features of measurements. The employed statistical formulation is advocated for the teaching of quantum theory.

abstract: Solid-state quantum sensors are attracting wide interest because of their exceptional sensitivity at room temperature. In particular, the spin properties of individual nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond make it an outstanding nanoscale sensor of magnetic fields, electric fields, and temperature, under ambient conditions. Recent work on ensemble NV-based magnetometers, inertial sensors, and clocks have employed $N$ unentangled color centers to realize a factor of up to $\sqrt{N}$ improvement in sensitivity. However, to realize fully this signal enhancement, new techniques are required to excite efficiently and to collect fluorescence from large NV ensembles. Here, we introduce a light-trapping diamond waveguide (LTDW) geometry that enables both high fluorescence collection ($\sim20\%$) and efficient pump absorption achieving an effective path length exceeding $1$ meter in a millimeter-sized device. The LTDW enables in excess of $2\%$ conversion efficiency of pump photons into optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) fluorescence, a \textit{three orders of magnitude} improvement over previous single-pass geometries. This dramatic enhancement of ODMR signal enables broadband measurements of magnetic field and temperature at less than $1$ Hz, a frequency range inaccessible by dynamical decoupling techniques. We demonstrate $\sim 1~\mbox{nT}/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ magnetic field sensitivity for $0.1$ Hz to $10$ Hz and a thermal sensitivity of $\sim 400 ~\mu\mbox{K}/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ and estimate a spin projection limit at $\sim 0.36$ fT/$\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ and $\sim 139~\mbox{pK}/\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$, respectively.

abstract: With the decline of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the recent experiments indicating that quantum mechanics does actually embody 'objective reality', one might ask if a 'mechanical', conceptual model for quantum mechanics could be found. We propose such a model. Vacuum energy fluctuations imply mass fluctuations and, through general relativity, curvature fluctuations. And those fluctuations are indicated by fluctuations of the metric tensor. The metric tensor fluctuations can 'explain' the uncertainty relations and non-commuting properties of conjugate variables. We argue that that the probability density is proportional to the square root of minus the determinant of the metric tensor (the differential volume element). We argue that the metric elements are not stochastic but are oscillating at a high enough frequency that measured values of same appear stochastic (i.e. crypto-stochastic). We suggest that the oscillations at the position of particles are described as torsional vibrations. A crypto-stochastic (or chaotic) oscillating metric yields, among other things, a model of super-position, photon polarization, and entanglement, and all within the confines of a 4-dimensional space-time.

abstract: Enhancing the quantum correlations in realistic quantum systems interacting with the environment of finite temperature is an important subject in quantum information processing. In this paper, we use weak measurement and measurement reversal to enhance the quantum correlations in a quantum system consisting of two particles. The transitions of the quantum correlations measured by the local quantum uncertainty of qubit-qubit and qutrit-qutrit quantum systems under generalized amplitude damping channels are investigated. We show that, after the weak measurement and measurement reversal, the joint system shows more robustness against decoherence.

abstract: Tensor networks are a central tool in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we initiate the study of tensor network non-zero testing (TNZ): Given a tensor network T, does T represent a non-zero vector? We show that TNZ is not in the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy unless the hierarchy collapses. We next show (among other results) that the special cases of TNZ on non-negative and injective tensor networks are in NP. Using this, we make a simple observation: The commuting variant of the MA-complete stoquastic k-SAT problem on D-dimensional qudits is in NP for logarithmic k and constant D. This reveals the first class of quantum Hamiltonians whose commuting variant is known to be in NP for all (1) logarithmic k, (2) constant D, and (3) for arbitrary interaction graphs.

abstract: We explore the connection between two recently introduced notions of non-Markovian quantum dynamics and the validity of the so-called quantum regression theorem. While non-Markovianity of a quantum dynamics has been defined looking at the behaviour in time of the statistical operator, which determines the evolution of mean values, the quantum regression theorem makes statements about the behaviour of system correlation functions of order two and higher. The comparison relies on an estimate of the validity of the quantum regression hypothesis, which can be obtained exactly evaluating two points correlation functions. To this aim we consider a qubit undergoing dephasing due to interaction with a bosonic bath, comparing the exact evaluation of the non-Markovianity measures with the violation of the quantum regression theorem for a class of spectral densities. We further study a photonic dephasing model, recently exploited for the experimental measurement of non-Markovianity. It appears that while a non-Markovian dynamics according to either definition brings with itself violation of the regression hypothesis, even Markovian dynamics can lead to a failure of the regression relation.

abstract: The Coulomb repulsion between ions in a linear Paul trap give rise to anharmonic terms in the potential energy when expanded about the equilibrium positions. We examine the effect of these anharmonic terms on the accuracy of a quantum simulator made from trapped ions. To be concrete, we consider a linear chain of $\text{Yb}^{171+}$ ions stabilized close to the zigzag transition. We find that for typical experimental temperatures, frequencies change by no more than a factor of $0.01\%$ due to the anharmonic couplings. Furthermore, shifts in the effective spin-spin interactions (driven by a spin-dependent optical dipole force) also tend to be small for detunings to the blue of the transverse center-of-mass frequency. However, detuning the spin interactions near other frequencies can lead to nonnegligible anharmonic contributions to the effective spin-spin interactions. We also examine an odd behavior exhibited by the harmonic spin-spin interactions for a range of intermediate detunings, where nearest neighbor spins with a larger spatial separation on the ion chain interact more strongly than nearest neighbors with a smaller spatial separation.

abstract: We investigate multipartite entanglement in rings of arbitrary spins with antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbors. In particular, we show that the non-degenerate ground state of rings formed by an even number ($N$) of spins is $N$-partite entangled, and exchange energy can thus be used as a multipartite-entanglement witness. We develop a general approach to compute the energy minima corresponding to biseparable states, and provide numerical results for a representative set of systems. Despite its global character, exchange energy also allows a spin-selective characterization of entanglement. In particular, in the presence of a magnetic defect, one can derive separability criteria for each individual spin, and use exchange energy for detecting entanglement between this and all the other spins.

We achieve gate fidelities ranging between $97.1(2)\%$ (for a gate time $t_g=3.8\mu$s) and $99.9(1)\%$ (for $t_g=100\mu$s), representing respectively the fastest and lowest-error two-qubit gates reported between trapped-ion qubits by nearly an order of magnitude in each case.

abstract: We explore the relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems that undergo purely dissipative dynamics through non-classical jump operators that can establish quantum coherence. Our goal is to shed light on the differences in the relaxation dynamics that arise in comparison to systems evolving via classical rate equations. In particular, we focus on a scenario where both quantum and classical dissipative evolution lead to a stationary state with the same values of diagonal or "classical" observables. As a basis for illustrating our ideas we use spin systems whose dynamics becomes correlated and complex due to dynamical constraints, inspired by kinetically constrained models (KCMs) of classical glasses. We show that in the quantum case the relaxation can be orders of magnitude slower than the classical one due to the presence of quantum coherences. Aspects of these idealized quantum KCMs become manifest in a strongly interacting Rydberg gas under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions in an appropriate limit. Beyond revealing a link between this Rydberg gas and the rather abstract dissipative KCMs of quantum glassy systems, our study sheds light on the limitations of the use of classical rate equations for capturing the non-equilibrium behavior of this many-body system.

abstract: In these notes, based on lectures given as part of the Les Houches summer school on Quantum Optics and Nanophotonics in August, 2013, I have tried to give a brief survey of some important approaches and modern tendencies in quantum measurement. I wish it to be clear from the outset that I shy explicitly away from the "quantum measurement problem," and that the present treatment aims to elucidate the theory and practice of various ways in which measurements can, in light of quantum mechanics, be carried out; and various formalisms for describing them. While the treatment is by necessity largely theoretical, the emphasis is meant to be on an experimental "perspective" on measurement -- that is, to place the priority on the possibility of gaining information through some process, and then attempting to model that process mathematically and consider its ramifications, rather than stressing a particular mathematical definition as the {\it sine qua non} of measurement. The textbook definition of measurement as being a particular set of mathematical operations carried out on particular sorts of operators has been so well drilled into us that many have the unfortunate tendency of saying "that experiment can't be described by projections onto the eigenstates of a Hermitian operator, so it is not really a measurement," when of course any practitioner of an experimental science such as physics should instead say "that experiment allowed us to measure something, and if the standard theory of measurement does not describe it, the standard theory of measurement is incomplete." Idealisations are important, but when the real world breaks the approximations made in the theory, it is the theory which must be fixed, and not the real world.

abstract: We develop the theory to describe the equilibrium ion positions and phonon modes for a trapped ion quantum simulator in an oblate Paul trap that creates two-dimensional Coulomb crystals in a triangular lattice. By coupling the internal states of the ions to laser beams propagating along the symmetry axis, we study the effective Ising spin-spin interactions that are mediated via the axial phonons and are less sensitive to ion micromotion. We find that the axial mode frequencies permit the programming of Ising interactions with inverse power law spin-spin couplings that can be tuned from uniform to $r^{-3}$ with DC voltages. Such a trap could allow for interesting new geometrical configurations for quantum simulations on moderately sized systems including frustrated magnetism on triangular lattices or Aharonov-Bohm effects on ion tunneling. The trap also incorporates periodic boundary conditions around loops which could be employed to examine time crystals.

In this way, one can use Feynman's Clock not only to simulate the evolution of a quantum system, but also it's interaction with an environment such as a heat bath or measuring apparatus. A simple numerical example of a two-level atom undergoing spontaneous emission is presented and analyzed.

abstract: It is shown that under certain dynamical conditions a material wave packet displays coherent, non-dispersive accelerated evolution in gravitational field over a modulated atomic mirror. The phenomenon takes place as a consequence of simultaneous presence of the dynamical localization and the coherent Fermi acceleration for the same modulation amplitude. It is purely a quantum mechanical effect as the windows of modulation strengths supporting dynamical localization and Fermi acceleration overlap for larger effective Plank constant. Present day experimental techniques make it feasible to realize the system in laboratory.

abstract: Quantum fields are generally taken to be operator-valued distributions, linear functionals of test functions into an algebra of operators; here the effective dynamics of an interacting quantum field is taken to be nonlinearly modified by properties of test functions, in a way that preserves Poincar\'e invariance, microcausality, and the Fock-Hilbert space structure of the free field. The construction can be taken to be a physically comprehensible regularization because we can introduce a sequence that has a limit that is a conventional interacting quantum field, with the usual informal dependence of the effective dynamics on properties of the experimental apparatus made formally explicit as a dependence on the test functions that are used to model the experimental apparatus.

abstract: In the study of open quantum systems, information exchange between system and its surrounding environment plays an eminent and important role in analysing the dynamics of open quantum system. In this work, by making use of the quantum information theory and intrinsic properties such as \emph{entropy exchange}, \emph{coherent information} and using the notion of \emph{quantum loss} as a criterion of the amount of lost information, we will propose a new witness, based on information exchange, to detect non-Markovianity. Also a measure for determining the degree of non-Markovianity, will be introduced by using our witness. The characteristic of non-Markovianity is clarified by means of our witness, and we emphasize that this measure is constructed based on the loss of information or in other word the rate of \emph{quantum loss} in the environment. It is defined in term of reducing correlation between system and ancillary. Actually, our focus is on the information which be existed in the environment and it has been entered to the environment due to its interaction with the system. Remarkably, due to choosing the situation which the "system +ancillary" in maximal entangled pure state, optimization procedure does not need in calculation of our measure, such that the degree of non-Markovianity is computed analytically by straightforward calculations.

The usual derivations of LGI assume \emph {macroscopic realism per se } and \emph {noninvasive measurability}. We derive these inequalities under a different set of assumptions, namely the assumptions of \emph{predictability} and \emph{no signaling in time}. As a novel implication of this derivation, we show that LGI can be used to certify randomness in a device independent way.

Here we address the characterization of LMG systems, i.e. the estimation of anisotropy, and show how criticality may be exploited to improve precision. In particular, we provide exact results for the Quantum Fisher Information of small-size LMG chains made of $N=2, 3$ and $4$ lattice sites and analyze the same quantity in the thermodynamical limit by means of a zero-th order approximation of the system Hamiltonian. We then show that the ultimate bounds to precision may be achieved by tuning the external field and by measuring the total magnetization of the system. We also address the use of LMG systems as quantum thermometers and show that: i) precision is governed by the gap between the lowest energy levels of the systems, ii) field-dependent level crossing provides a resource to extend the operating range of the quantum thermometer.

abstract: We study the dynamics of genuine multipartite entanglement for a system of four qubits. Using a computable entanglement monotone for multipartite systems, we investigate the as yet unexplored aspects of a cavity-reservoir system of qubits. For one specific initial state, we observe a sudden transition in the dynamics of genuine entanglement for the four qubits. This sudden change occurs only during a time window where neither cavity-cavity qubits nor reservoir-reservoir qubits are entangled. We show that this sudden change in dynamics of this specific state is extremely sensitive to white noise.

abstract: The scattering of a flying photon by a two-level system ultrastrongly coupled to a one-dimensional photonic waveguide is studied numerically. The photonic medium is modeled as an array of coupled cavities and the whole system is analyzed beyond the rotating wave approximation using Matrix Product States. It is found that the scattering is strongly influenced by the single- and multi-photon dressed bound states present in the system. In the ultrastrong coupling regime a new channel for inelastic scattering appears, where an incident photon deposits energy into the qubit, exciting a photon-bound state, and escaping with a lower frequency. This single-photon nonlinear frequency conversion process can reach up to 50\% efficiency. Other remarkable features in the scattering induced by counter-rotating terms are a blueshift of the reflection resonance and a Fano resonance due to long-lived excited states

abstract: A model for a quantum heat bath is introduced. When the bath molecules have finitely many degrees of freedom, it is shown that the assumption that the molecules are weakly interacting is sufficient to enable one to derive the canonical distribution for the energy of a small system immersed in the bath. While the specific form of the bath temperature, for which we provide an explicit formula, depends on (i) spectral properties of the bath molecules, and (ii) the choice of probability measure on the state space of the bath, we are in all cases able to establish the existence of a strictly positive lower bound on the temperature of the bath. The results can be used to test the merits of different hypotheses for the equilibrium states of quantum systems. Two examples of physically plausible choices for the probability measure on the state space of a quantum heat bath are considered in detail, and the associated lower bounds on the temperature of the bath are worked out.

abstract: Hardy's paradox is of fundamental importance in quantum information theory. So far, there have been two types of its extensions into higher dimensions: in the first type the maximum probability of nonlocal events is roughly $9\%$ and remains the same as the dimension changes (dimension-independent), while in the second type the probability becomes larger as the dimension increases, reaching approximately $40\%$ in the infinite limit. Here, we (i) give an alternative proof of the first type, (ii) study the situation in which the maximum probability of nonlocal events can also be dimension-independent in the second type, and (iii) conjecture how the situation could be changed in order that (ii) still holds.

abstract: A quantum key distribution system may be probed by an eavesdropper Eve by sending in bright light from the quantum channel and analyzing the back-reflections. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a setup for mounting such a Trojan-horse attack. We show it in operation against the quantum cryptosystem Clavis2 from ID~Quantique, as a proof-of-principle. With just a few back-reflected photons, Eve discerns Bob's secret basis choice, and thus the raw key bit in the Scarani-Ac\'in-Ribordy-Gisin 2004 protocol, with higher than 90% probability. This would clearly breach the security of the cryptosystem. Unfortunately in Clavis2 Eve's bright pulses have a side effect of causing high level of afterpulsing in Bob's single-photon detectors, resulting in a high quantum bit error rate that effectively protects this system from our attack. However, in a Clavis2-like system equipped with detectors with less-noisy but realistic characteristics, an attack strategy with positive leakage of the key would exist. We confirm this by a numerical simulation. Both the eavesdropping setup and strategy can be generalized to attack most of the current QKD systems, especially if they lack proper safeguards. We also propose countermeasures to prevent such attacks.

abstract: Using the recently proposed quantum electrodynamical formalism, we calculate the Casimir-Polder free energies and forces between the ground state atoms of Rb, Na, Cs and He${}^{\ast}$ and the plates made of Au, Si, sapphire and fused silica coated with a graphene sheet. It is shown that the graphene coating has no effect on the Casimir-Polder interaction for metallic plates, but influences significantly for plates made of dielectric materials. The influence of graphene coating increases with decreasing static dielectric permittivity of the plate material and the characteristic frequency of an atomic dynamic polarizability. Simple analytic expressions for the classical limit of the Casimir-Polder free energy and force between an atom and a graphene-coated plate are obtained. From the comparison with the results of numerical computations, the application region of these expressions is determined.

abstract: In order to faithfully detect the state of an individual two-state quantum system (qubit) realized using, for example, a trapped ion or atom, state selective scattering of resonance fluorescence is well established. The simplest way to read out this measurement and assign a state is the threshold method. The detection error can be decreased by using more advanced detection methods like the time-resolved method or the $\pi$-pulse detection method. These methods were introduced to qubits with a single possible state change during the measurement process. However, there exist many qubits like the hyperfine qubit of $^{171}Yb^+$ where several state change are possible. To decrease the detection error for such qubits, we develope generalizations of the time-resolved method and the $\pi$-pulse detection method for such qubits. We show the advantages of these generalized detection methods in numerical simulations and experiments using the hyperfine qubit of $^{171}Yb^+$. The generalized detection methods developed here can be implemented in an efficient way such that experimental real time state discrimination with improved fidelity is possible.

abstract: We investigate the optomechanical photon-phonon coupling of a single light mode propagating through an array of vibrating mechanical elements. As recently shown for the particular case of a periodic array of membranes embedded in a high-finesse optical cavity [A. Xuereb, C. Genes and A. Dantan, Phys. Rev. Lett., \textbf{109}, 223601, (2012)], the intracavity linear optomechanical coupling can be considerably enhanced over the single element value in the so-called \textit{transmissive regime}, where for motionless membranes the whole system is transparent to light. Here, we extend these investigations to quasi-periodic arrays in the presence of engineered spatial defects in the membrane positions. In particular we show that the localization of light modes induced by the defect combined with the access of the transmissive regime window can lead to additional enhancement of the strength of both linear and quadratic optomechanical couplings.

abstract: Hidden Markov Models are widely used in classical computer science to model stochastic processes with a wide range of applications. This paper concerns the quantum analogues of these machines --- so-called Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs). Using the properties of Quantum Physics, HQMMs are able to generate more complex random output sequences than their classical counterparts, even when using the same number of internal states. They are therefore expected to find applications as quantum simulators of stochastic processes. Here, we emphasise that open quantum systems with instantaneous feedback are examples of HQMMs, thereby identifying a novel application of quantum feedback control.

abstract: The interferometric power of a bipartite quantum state quantifies the precision, measured by quantum Fisher information, that such a state enables for the estimation of a parameter embedded in a unitary dynamics applied to one subsystem only, in the worst-case scenario where a full knowledge of the generator of the dynamics is not available a priori. For finite-dimensional systems, this quantity was proven to be a faithful measure of quantum correlations beyond entanglement. Here we extend the notion of interferometric power to the technologically relevant setting of optical interferometry with continuous-variable probes. By restricting to Gaussian local dynamics, we obtain a closed formula for the interferometric power of all two-mode Gaussian states. We identify separable and entangled Gaussian states which maximize the interferometric power at fixed mean photon number of the probes, and discuss the associated metrological scaling. At fixed entanglement of the probes, highly thermalized states can guarantee considerably larger precision than pure two-mode squeezed states.

Famous Landauer's formula for a minimal cost of information processing is replaced by a new one which takes into account accuracy and stability of information encoding. Two recent experiments illustrating the information-energy conversion are critically discussed.

abstract: Current approaches for building quantum computing devices focus on two-level quantum systems which nicely mimic the concept of a classical bit, albeit enhanced with additional quantum properties. However, rather than artificially limiting the number of states to two, the use of d-level quantum systems (qudits) could provide advantages for quantum information processing. Among other merits, it has recently been shown that multi-level quantum systems can offer increased stability to external disturbances - a key problem in current technologies. In this study we demonstrate that topological quantum memories built from qudits, also known as abelian quantum double models, exhibit a substantially increased resilience to noise. That is, even when taking into account the multitude of errors possible for multi-level quantum systems, topological quantum error correction codes employing qudits can sustain a larger error rate than their two-level counterparts. In particular, we find strong numerical evidence that the thresholds of these error-correction codes are given by the hashing bound. Considering the significantly increased error thresholds attained, this might well outweigh the added complexity of engineering and controlling higher dimensional quantum systems.

abstract: The generation of non-classical states of large quantum systems has attracted much interest from a foundational perspective, but also because of the significant potential of such states in emerging quantum technologies. In this paper we consider the possibility of generating non-classical states of a system of spins by interaction with an ancillary system, starting from an easily prepared initial state . We extend previous results for an ancillary system comprising a single spin to bigger ancillary systems and the interaction strength is enhanced by a factor of the number of ancillary spins. Depending on initial conditions, we find -- by a combination of approximation and numerics -- that the system of spins can evolve to spin cat states, spin squeezed states or to multiple cat states. We also discuss some candidate systems for implementation of the Hamiltonian necessary to generate these non-classical states.

abstract: We explore the dynamics of hard-core lattice bosons in the presence of strong non-local particle loss. The evolution occurs on two distinct time-scales, first a rapid strongly correlated decay into a highly degenerate Zeno state subspace, followed by a slow almost coherent evolution. We analytically solve the fast initial dynamics of the system, where we specifically focus on an initial Mott insulator state, and perform an analysis of the particle arrangements in the Zeno subspace. We investigate the secondary slow relaxation process that follows and find an intricate regime where the competition between dissipation and coherence results in various types of interacting particle complexes. We classify them and analyse their spectral properties in the presence and absence of nearest-neighbor interactions. Under certain circumstances the dispersion relations of the complexes feature flat bands, which are a result of an effective spin-orbit coupling.

abstract: We prove that whenever the coherent information of a one-mode Gaussian channel is non-zero its supremum is achieved for the infinite input power. This is a well established fact for the zero added classical noise, whereas the nonzero case has not been studied in detail. The presented analysis fills the gap for three canonical classes of one-mode Gaussian channels: the lossy, amplifying and additive classical noise channel class. For the remaining one-mode Gaussian channel classes the coherent information is known to vanish.

The (un)decidability and complexity of these problems are settled, or their relationships with certain long-standing open problems are clarified. We also develop an algorithm for finding optimal scheduler that attains the supremum reachability probability.

However, the single- and two-qubit operations of time-bin qubits have been largely unexplored compared with those of polarization qubits. Here, I present a simple scheme for implementing a basic two-qubit operation, namely an "entangling" operation of two independent time-bin qubits, based on Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference in a high-speed 2x2 optical switch. With the proposed scheme, the formation of a time-bin entanglement was confirmed experimentally.

The criterion can be used to detect whether two quantum states in multi-qubit systems are local unitary equivalent or not. Once obtaining the positive answer, we are further able to compute the corresponding unitary operators precisely. Since the scheme is based on the mean values of some quantum mechanical observables, it supplies an experimental way to judge the local equivalence of quantum states.

abstract: Secret communication over public channels is one of the central pillars of a modern information society. Using quantum key distribution (QKD) this is achieved without relying on the hardness of mathematical problems which might be compromised by improved algorithms or by future quantum computers. State-of-the-art QKD requires composable security against coherent attacks for a finite number of samples. Here, we present the first implementation of QKD satisfying this requirement and additionally achieving security which is independent of any possible flaws in the implementation of the receiver. By distributing strongly Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled continuous variable (CV) light in a table-top arrangement, we generated secret keys using a highly efficient error reconciliation algorithm. Since CV encoding is compatible with conventional optical communication technology, we consider our work to be a major promotion for commercialized QKD providing composable security against the most general channel attacks.

We show how a definite result of a measurement can be fully determined when considering specific forward and backward-evolving quantum states. Moreover, we show how macroscopic time-reversibility is attained, at the level of a single branch of the wavefunction, when several conditions regarding the final state and dynamics are met, a property for which we coin the term "classical robustness under time-reversal". These entail a renewed perspective on the measurement problem, the Born rule and the many-worlds interpretation.

abstract: We introduce a novel strategy, based on the use of modular variables, to encode and deterministically process quantum information using states described by continuous variables. Our formalism leads to a general recipe to adapt existing quantum information protocols, originally formulated for finite dimensional quantum systems, to infinite dimensional systems described by continuous variables. This is achieved by using non unitary and non-gaussian operators, obtained from the superposition of gaussian gates, together with adaptative manipulations in qubit systems defined in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. We describe in details the realization of single and two qubit gates and briefly discuss their implementation in a quantum optical set-up.

abstract: In this work we address two questions concerning Grover's algorithm. In the first we give an answer to the question how to employ Grover's algorithm for actual search over database. We introduce a quantum model of an unordered phone book (quantum database) with programmable queries to search in the phone book either for a number, or for a name. In the second part we investigate how successful the algorithm can be if the number of elements of the database is not known precisely. This question reduces to analysis of the distinguishability of states occurring during Grover's algorithm. We found that using unambiguous discrimination scheme even a seemingly good guess, that is close to the optimal one can result in a rather small success rate.

abstract: This work presents some peculiarities of the near quantum ground state behaviour of curved (phonon trapping) Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) cavities when compared to a conventional mechanical resonator. The curved cavity system resolves the quandary of the conventional mechanical system where the Bose-Einstein distribution requires higher frequencies for lower quantum occupation factors contrary to the constraint of an inverse frequency dependence of the quantum fluctuations of displacement. We demonstrate how the non-trivial cavity geometry can lead to better phonon trapping, enhancing the variance of zero-point-fluctuations of displacement. This variance becomes independent of overtone number (or BAW resonance frequency) overcoming the constraint and allowing better observation of quantum effects in a mechanical system. The piezoelectric electro-mechanical coupling approach is qualitatively compared to the parametric optomechanical technique for the curved BAW cavities. In both cases the detectible quantity grows proportional to the square root of the overtone number, and thus the resonance frequency. Also, the phonon trapping improves with higher overtone numbers, which allows the electrode size to be reduced such that in the optimal case the parasitic capacitive impedance becomes independent of the overtone number, allowing effective coupling to very high frequency overtones.

abstract: To control a quantum system via feedback, we generally have two options in choosing control scheme. One is the coherent feedback, which feeds the output field of the system, through a fully quantum device, back to manipulate the system without involving any measurement process. The other one is the measurement-based feedback, which measures the output field and performs a real-time manipulation on the system based on the measurement results. Both schemes have advantages/disadvantages, depending on the system and the control goal, hence their comparison in several situation is important. This paper considers a general open linear quantum system with the following specific control goals; back-action evasion (BAE), generation of a quantum non-demolished (QND) variable, and generation of a decoherence-free subsystem (DFS), all of which have important roles in quantum information science. Then some no-go theorems are proven, clarifying that those goals cannot be achieved by any measurement-based feedback control. On the other hand it is shown that, for each control goal, there exists a coherent feedback controller accomplishing the task. The key idea to obtain all the results is system theoretic characterizations of BAE, QND, and DFS in terms of controllability and observability properties or transfer functions of linear systems, which are consistent with their standard definitions.

abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of the Hamiltonian manipulation in light-atom interface in Raman-type warm rubidium-87 vapor atomic memory. By adjusting the detuning of the driving beam we varied the relative contributions of the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering to the process of four-wave mixing which reads out a spatially multimode state of atomic memory. We measured the temporal evolution of the readout fields and the spatial intensity correlations between write-in and readout as a function of detuning with the use of an intensified camera. The correlation maps enabled us to resolve between the anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering and to quantify their contributions. Our experimental results agree quantitatively with a simple, plane-wave theoretical model we provide. They allow for a simple interpretation of the coaction of the anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering at the readout stage. The Stokes contribution yields additional, adjustable gain at the readout stage, albeit with inevitable extra noise. Here we provide a simple and useful framework to trace it, which is significant to the existing atomic memories setups. Furthermore, the shown Hamiltonian manipulation offers a broad range of atom-light interfaces readily applicable in current and future quantum protocols with atomic ensembles.

abstract: In the theory of algebraic groups, parabolic subgroups form a crucial building block in the structural studies. In the case of general linear groups over a finite field $F_q$, given a sequence of positive integers $n_1, ..., n_k$, where $n=n_1+...+n_k$, a parabolic subgroup of parameter $(n_1, ..., n_k)$ in $GL_n(F_q)$ is a conjugate of the subgroup consisting of block lower triangular matrices where the $i$th block is of size $n_i$. Our main result is a quantum algorithm of time polynomial in $\log q$ and $n$ for solving the hidden subgroup problem in $GL_n(F_q)$, when the hidden subgroup is promised to be a parabolic subgroup. Our algorithm works with no prior knowledge of the parameter of the hidden parabolic subgroup. Prior to this work, such an efficient quantum algorithm was only known for the case $n=2$ (A. Denney, C. Moore, and A. Russell (2010), Quantum Inf. Comput., Vol. 10, pp. 282-291), and for minimal parabolic subgroups (Borel subgroups), for the case when $q$ is not much smaller than $n$ (G. Ivanyos: Quantum Inf. Comput., Vol. 12, pp. 661-669).

abstract: Several groups are carrying out experiments to observe and measure vacuum magnetic birefringence, predicted by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). We have started running the new PVLAS apparatus installed in Ferrara, Italy, and have measured a noise floor value for the unitary field magnetic birefringence of vacuum $\Delta n_u^{\rm (vac)}= (4\pm 20) \times 10^{-23}$ T$^{-2}$ (the error represents a 1$\sigma$ deviation). This measurement is compatible with zero and hence represents a new limit on vacuum magnetic birefringence deriving from non linear electrodynamics. This result reduces to a factor 50 the gap to be overcome to measure for the first time the value of $\Delta n_u^{\rm (vac,QED)}$ predicted by QED: $\Delta n_u^{\rm (vac,QED)}= 4\times 10^{-24}$ ~T$^{-2}$. These birefringence measurements also yield improved model-independent bounds on the coupling constant of axion-like particles to two photons, for masses greater than 1 meV, along with a factor two improvement of the fractional charge limit on millicharged particles (fermions and scalars), including neutrinos.

abstract: One way quantum computing uses single qubit projective measurements performed on a cluster state (a highly entangled state of multiple qubits) in order to enact quantum gates. The model is promising due to its potential scalability; the cluster state may be produced at the beginning of the computation and operated on over time. Continuous variables (CV) offer another potential benefit in the form of deterministic entanglement generation. This determinism can lead to robust cluster states and scalable quantum computation. Recent demonstrations of CV cluster states have made great strides on the path to scalability utilizing either time or frequency multiplexing in optical parametric oscillators (OPO) both above and below threshold. The techniques relied on a combination of entangling operators and beam splitter transformations. Here we show that an analogous transformation exists for amplifiers with Gaussian inputs states operating on multiple spatial modes. By judicious selection of local oscillators (LOs), the spatial mode distribution is analogous to the optical frequency comb consisting of axial modes in an OPO cavity. We outline an experimental system that generates cluster states across the spatial frequency comb which can also scale the amount of quantum noise reduction to potentially larger than in other systems.

abstract: The efficient initialization of a quantum system is a prerequisite for quantum technological applications. Here we show that several classes of quantum states of a harmonic oscillator can be efficiently prepared by means of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction with a single two-level system. This is achieved by suitably tailoring external fields which drive the dipole and/or the oscillator. The time-dependent dynamics that leads to the target state is identified by means of Optimal Control Theory (OCT) based on Krotov's method. Infidelities below $10^{-4}$ can be reached for the parameters of the experiment of the ENS group in Paris, where the oscillator is a mode of a high-Q microwave cavity and the dipole is a Rydberg transition of an atom. For this specific situation we analyze the limitations on the fidelity due to parameter fluctuations and identify robust dynamics based on pulses found using ensemble OCT. Our analysis can be extended to quantum-state preparation of continuous-variable systems in other platforms, such as trapped ions and circuit QED.

abstract: A new commitment scheme based on position-verification and non-local quantum correlations is presented here for the first time in literature. The only credential for unconditional security is the position of committer and non-local correlations generated; neither receiver has any pre-shared data with the committer nor does receiver require trusted and authenticated quantum/classical channels between him and the committer. In the proposed scheme, receiver trusts the commitment only if the scheme itself verifies position of the committer and validates her commitment through non-local quantum correlations in a single round. The position-based commitment scheme bounds committer to reveal valid commitment within allocated time and guarantees that the receiver will not be able to get information about commitment unless committer reveals. The scheme works for the commitment of both bits and qubits and is equally secure against committer/receiver as well as against any third party who may have interests in destroying the commitment. Our proposed scheme is unconditionally secure in general and evades Mayers and Lo-Chau attacks in particular.

abstract: Quantum discord quantifies how much Alice's system is disrupted after a measurement is performed on Bob's. Conceptually, this behavior acts the same way as quantum steering and we find that the discord grows with better steering from Bob to Alice. Using Venn diagrams, the relations between the different classes of Gaussian continuous variable entanglement and the links to discord for the squeezed-thermal states are established. We identify a directional quantum teleportation task for each class of squeezed-thermal state entanglement, and establish a unified signature for quantum steering, entanglement and discord beyond entanglement. Quantum steering and discord are promising candidates to quantify the potential of the directional quantum tasks where Alice and Bob possess asymmetrically noisy channels.

abstract: Boson-sampling is a simplified model for quantum computing that may hold the key to implementing the first ever post-classical quantum computer. Boson-sampling is a non-universal quantum computer that is significantly more straightforward to build than any universal quantum computer proposed so far. We begin this chapter by motivating boson-sampling and discussing the history of linear optics quantum computing. We then summarize the boson-sampling formalism, discuss what a sampling problem is, explain why boson-sampling is easier than linear optics quantum computing, and discuss the Extended Church-Turing thesis. Next, sampling with other classes of quantum optical states is analyzed. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of building a boson-sampling device using existing technology.

abstract: We study internal work optimization over the energy levels of a generic hot quantum Otto engine. We find universal features in the efficiency that resembles the classical external power optimization over the coupling times to the thermal baths. It is shown that in the ultra hot regime the efficiency is determined solely by the optimization constraint, and independent of the engine details. We show that for some constraints the radius of convergence of the perturbative approach used in the classical analysis is zero even for very arbitrarily low efficiencies at small temperature difference.

abstract: The Majorana's stellar representation, which represents the evolution of a quantum state with the trajectories of the Majorana stars on a Bloch sphere, provides an intuitive way to study a physical system with high dimensional projective Hilbert space. In this Letter, we study the Berry phase by these stars and their loops on the Bloch sphere. It is shown that the Berry phase of a general spin state can be expressed by an elegant formula with the solid angles of Majorana star loops. Furthermore, these results can be naturally used to a general state with arbitrary dimensions. To demonstrate our theory, we study a two mode interacting boson system. Finally, the relation between stars' correlations and quantum entanglement is discussed.

abstract: The ground state and spectral properties of Bose gases in double-well potentials are studied in two different scenarios: i) an interacting atomic Bose gas, and ii) a mixture of an atomic gas interacting with diatomic molecules. A ground state second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is observed in both scenarios. For large attractive values of the atom-atom interaction, the ground-state is degenerate. For repulsive and small attractive interaction, the ground-state is not degenerate and is well approximated by a boson coherent state. Both systems depict an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT). For the mixed atom-molecule system the critical point of the ESQPT displays a discontinuity in the first derivative of the density of states.

abstract: We demonstrate Werner-like polarization-entangled state generation disapproving local hidden variable theory from a single semiconductor quantum dot. By exploiting tomographic analysis with temporal gating, we find biphoton states are mapped on the Werner state, which is crucial for quantum information applications due to its versatile ramifications such as usefulness to teleportation. Observed time evolution of the biphoton state brings us systematic understanding on a relationship between tomographically reconstructed biphoton state and a set of parameters characterizing exciton state including fine-structure splitting and cross-dephasing time.

abstract: The existence of observables that are incompatible or not jointly measurable is a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics, which is the root of a number of nonclassical phenomena, such as uncertainty relations, wave--particle dual behavior, Bell-inequality violation, and contextuality. However, no intuitive criterion is available for determining the compatibility of even two (generalized) observables, despite the overarching importance of this problem and intensive efforts of many researchers over more than 80 years. Here we introduce an information theoretic paradigm together with an intuitive geometric picture for decoding incompatible observables, starting from two simple ideas: Every observable can only provide limited information and information is monotonic under data processing. By virtue of quantum estimation theory, we introduce a family of universal criteria for detecting incompatible observables and a natural measure of incompatibility, which are applicable to arbitrary number of arbitrary observables. Based on this framework, we derive a family of universal measurement uncertainty relations, provide a simple information theoretic explanation of quantitative wave--particle duality, and offer new perspectives for understanding Bell nonlocality, contextuality, and quantum precision limit.

abstract: It is often said that the transition from quantum to classical worlds is caused by decoherence originated from an interaction between a system of interest and its surrounding environment. Here we establish a computational quantum-classical boundary from the viewpoint of classical simulatability of a quantum system under decoherence. Specifically, we consider the commuting quantum circuits as dynamics of the quantum system. To show intractability of classical simulation above the boundary, we utilize the postselection argument introduced by M. J. Bremner, R. Jozsa, and D. J. Shepherd [Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Science 465, 1413 (2009).] and crucially strengthen its statement by taking noise effect into account. Classical simulatability below the boundary is shown by taking a projected-entangled-pair-state picture. Not only the separability criteria but also the condition for the entangled pair to become a convex mixture of stabilizer states is developed to show classical simulatability of highly entangling operations. We found that when each qubit is subject to a single-qubit complete-positive-trace-preserving noise, the computational quantum-classical boundary is tightly given by the dephasing rate required for the magic state distillation.

abstract: We propose the subcarrier domain of multicarrier continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD). In a multicarrier CVQKD scheme, the information is granulated into Gaussian subcarrier CVs and the physical Gaussian link is divided into Gaussian sub-channels. The sub-channels are dedicated for the conveying of the subcarrier CVs. The angular domain utilizes the phase-space angles of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs to construct the physical model of a Gaussian sub-channel. The subcarrier domain injects physical attributes to the description of the subcarrier transmission. We prove that the subcarrier domain is a natural representation of the subcarrier-level transmission in a multicarrier CVQKD scheme. We also extend the subcarrier domain to a multiple-access multicarrier CVQKD setting. We demonstrate the results through the adaptive multicarrier quadrature-division (AMQD) CVQKD scheme and the AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation) multiple-access multicarrier scheme. The subcarrier domain representation provides a general apparatus that can be utilized for an arbitrary multicarrier CVQKD scenario. The framework is particularly convenient for experimental multicarrier CVQKD scenarios.

abstract: We study the properties of a quantum particle interacting with a one dimensional structure of equidistant scattering centres. We derive an analytical expression for the dispersion relation and for the Bloch functions in the presence of both even and odd scattering waves within the pseudopotential approximation. This generalises the well-known solid-state physics text-book result known as the Kronig-Penney model. Our generalised model can be used to describe systems such as degenerate Fermi gases interacting with ions or with another neutral atomic species confined in an optical lattice, thus enabling the investigation of polaron or Kondo physics within a simple formalism. We focus our attention on the specific atom-ion system and compare our findings with quantum defect theory. Excellent agreement is obtained within the regime of validity of the pseudopotential approximation. This enables us to derive a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian for a degenerate quantum Bose gas in a linear chain of ions.

abstract: We investigate the relation between the incompatibility of quantum measurements and quantum nonlocality. We show that any set of measurements that is not jointly measurable (i.e. incompatible) can be used for demonstrating EPR steering, a form of quantum nonlocality. This implies that EPR steering and (non) joint measurability can be viewed as equivalent. Moreover, we discuss the connection between Bell nonlocality and joint measurability, and give evidence that both notions are inequivalent. Specifically, we exhibit a set of incompatible quantum measurements and show that it does not violate a large class of Bell inequalities. This suggest the existence of incompatible quantum measurements which are Bell local, similarly to certain entangled states which admit a local hidden variable model.

abstract: Recently, Takeoka, Guha and Wilde have established a new (loose) upper bound on the secret key capacity of a pure-loss bosonic channel that is several times larger than an error-free BB84 QKD channel with same transmittance. This suggests that new QKD protocols may exist with higher secret key rates and effective ranges larger than the metro-area limits of BB84 QKD over optical fiber. In this paper we illustrate such a possibility with a new protocol called Amplified Quantum Key Distribution (AQKD), which will be compatible with the optical amplification typically encountered on inter-city fiber spans. We analyze one instantiation of AQKD, in which the transmitter enclave contains an optical amplifier (OA), with security against passive optical tapping. For this scenario AQKD is shown to: give three times the secret key rate of BB84 at spans up to 100km, increasing to more than a ten-fold gain at 140km; and double the maximum single-span optical fiber transmission range to inter-city distances (300km). Essential to these performance gains is a new information-theoretic protocol post-processing stage called generalized advantage distillation (GAD). AQKD could be implemented with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware as an augmentation of present-day BB84 QKD. AQKD avoids the expense, complexity and resource duplication of "trusted relay" approaches to QKD range extension. We expect AQKD to be compatible with fiber spans containing intermediate OAs, which will facilitate its deployment as an overlay on existing fiber networks.

This paper presents a simple example, including a way in which the system can be measured to violate Bell's inequalities. This classical simulation of a quantum system allows us to visualize entanglement and also helps us to see what aspects of quantum mechanical systems are truly nonclassical.

abstract: Uncertainty relations based on information theory for both discrete and continuous distribution functions are briefly reviewed. We extend these results to account for (differential) R\'{e}nyi entropy and its related entropy power. This allows us to find a new class of information-theoretic uncertainty relations (ITURs). The potency of such uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics is illustrated with a simple two-energy-level model where they outperform both the usual Robertson-Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relation and Kraus-Maassen Shannon entropy based uncertainty relation. In the continuous case the ensuing entropy power uncertainty relations are discussed in the context of heavy tailed wave functions and Schr\"odinger cat states. Again, improvement over both the Robertson-Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty principle and Shannon ITUR is demonstrated in these cases. Further salient issues such as the proof of a generalized entropy power inequality and a geometric picture of information-theoretic uncertainty relations are also discussed.

abstract: Simulation of quantum dynamics is a grand challenge of computational physics. In this work we investigate methods for reducing the demands of such simulation by identifying reduced-order models for dynamics generated by parameterized quantum Hamiltonians. In particular, we first formulate an algebraic condition that certifies the existence of invariant subspaces for a model defined by a parameterized Hamiltonian and an initial state. Following this we develop and analyze two methods to explicitly construct a reduced-order model, if one exists. In addition to general results characterizing invariant subspaces of arbitrary finite dimensional Hamiltonians, by exploiting properties of the generalized Pauli group we develop practical tools to speed up simulation of dynamics generated by certain spin Hamiltonians. To illustrate the methods developed we apply them to several paradigmatic spin models.

In the second case the state is the qutrit state which is not composed system. The notion of negativity and concurrence is defined for the qutrit state. The concurrence and negativity of entangled and separable qutrit states determined by the parameters of the density matrix are explicitly calculated. The maximum entanglement of the qutrit state is observed for maximum values of non diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix. New entropic inequalities for the density matrix of the qutrit state are obtained.

abstract: Self-testing refers to the fact that, in some quantum devices, both states and measurements can be assessed in a black-box scenario, on the sole basis of the observed statistics, i.e. without reference to any prior device calibration. Only a few examples of self-testing are known, and they just provide non-trivial assessment for devices performing unrealistically close to the ideal case. We overcome these difficulties by approaching self-testing with the semi-definite programming hierarchy for the characterization of quantum correlations. This allows us to improve dramatically the robustness of previous self-testing schemes -e.g.: we show that a CHSH violation larger than 2.57 certifies a singlet fidelity of more than 70%. In addition, the versatility of the tool brings about self-testing of hitherto impossible cases, such as robust self-testing of non-maximally entangled two-qutrit states in the CGLMP scenario.

abstract: We study quantum dynamics of Grover's adiabatic search algorithm with the equivalent two-level system. Its adiabatic and non-adiabatic evolutions are visualized as trajectories of Bloch vectors on a Bloch sphere. We find the change in the non-adiabatic transition probability from exponential decay for short running time to inverse-square decay for long running time. The size dependence of the critical running time is expressed in terms of Lambert $W$ function. The transitionless driving Hamiltonian is obtained to make a quantum state follow the adiabatic path. We demonstrate that a constant Hamiltonian, approximate to the exact time-dependent driving Hamiltonian, can alter the non-adiabatic transition probability from the inverse square decay to the inverse fourth power decay with running time. This may open up a new way of reducing errors in adiabatic quantum computation.

abstract: We derive one-shot upper bounds for quantum noisy channel codes. We do so by regarding a channel code as a bipartite operation with an encoder belonging to the sender and a decoder belonging to the receiver, and imposing constraints on the bipartite operation. We investigate the power of codes whose bipartite operation is non-signalling from Alice to Bob, positive-partial transpose (PPT) preserving, or both, and derive a simple semidefinite program for the achievable entanglement fidelity. Using the semidefinite program, we show that the non-signalling assisted quantum capacity for memoryless channels is equal to the entanglement-assisted capacity. We also relate our PPT-preserving codes and the PPT-preserving entanglement distillation protocols studied by Rains. Applying these results to a concrete example, the 3-dimensional Werner-Holevo channel, we find that codes that are non-signalling and PPT-preserving can be strictly less powerful than codes satisfying either one of the constraints, and therefore provide a tighter bound for unassisted codes. Furthermore, PPT-preserving non-signalling codes can send one qubit perfectly over two uses of the channel, which has no quantum capacity. We discuss whether this can be interpreted as a form of superactivation of quantum capacity.

abstract: We establish for the first time an exact stochastic dynamical equation for an open quantum systems coupled to correlated noises. We rigorously investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a qubit system under the influence of two strongly correlated non-Markovian baths by exactly solving the stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation of an open quantum system. We show that the quantum dynamics of the qubit system is profoundly modulated by the mutual correlation between baths and the bath memory times through dissipation and fluctuation. We report a new physical effect on generating large values of the inner-correlation and entanglement of the distant two qubits arising from the strong bath correlation for a class of super-radiation states.

abstract: Over the past several decades, a rich series of experiments has repeatedly verified the quantum nature of superconducting devices, leading some of these systems to be regarded as artificial atoms. In addition to their application in quantum information processing, these `atoms' provide a test bed for studying quantum mechanics in macroscopic limits. Regarding the last point, we present here a feasible protocol for directly testing time reversal symmetry in a superconducting artificial atom. Time reversal symmetry is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics and is expected to hold if the dynamics of the artificial atom strictly follow the Schroedinger equation. However, this property has yet to be tested in any macroscopic quantum system. The test we propose is based on the verification of the microreversibility principle, providing a viable approach to verify quantum work fluctuation theorems - an outstanding challenge in quantum statistical mechanics. For this, we outline a procedure that utilizes the microreversibility test in conjunction with numerical emulations of Gibbs ensembles to verify these theorems over a large temperature range.

abstract: Projective measurements are an essential element of quantum mechanics. In most cases, they cause an irreversible change of the quantum system on which they act. However, measurements can also be used to stabilize quantum states from decay processes, which is known as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Here, we demonstrate this effect for the case of superposition states of nuclear spin qubits, using an ancilla to perform the measurement. As a result, the quantum state of the qubit is protected against dephasing.

abstract: We introduce a general mapping for encoding quantum communication protocols involving pure states of multiple qubits, unitary transformations, and projective measurements into another set of protocols that employ coherent states of light in a superposition of optical modes, linear optics transformations and measurements with single-photon threshold detectors. This provides a general framework for transforming protocols in quantum communication into a form in which they can be implemented with current technology. We explore the similarity between properties of the original qubit protocols and the coherent-state protocols obtained from the mapping and make use of the mapping to construct new protocols in the context of quantum communication complexity and quantum digital signatures. Our results have the potential of bringing a wide class of quantum communication protocols closer to their experimental demonstration.

abstract: We present a graphical approach to understanding the degeneracy, density of states, and cumulative state number for some simple quantum systems. By taking advantage of basic computing operations we define a straightforward procedure for determining the relationship between discrete quantum energy levels and the corresponding density of states and cumulative level number. The density of states for a particle in a rigid box of various shapes and dimensions is examined and graphed. It is seen that the dimension of the box, rather than its shape, is the most important feature. In addition, we look at the density of states for a multi-particle system of identical bosons built on the single-particle spectra of those boxes. A simple model is used to explain how the $N$-particle density of states arises from the single particle system it is based on.

abstract: There exist diverse no-go theorems, ranging from no-cloning to monogamies of quantum correlations and Bell inequality violations, which restrict the processing of information in the quantum world. In a multipartite scenario, monogamy of Bell inequality violation and exclusion principle of dense coding are such theorems, which impede the ability of the system to have quantum advantage between all its parts. In ordered spin systems, the twin restrictions of translation invariance and monogamy of quantum correlations, in general, enforce the bipartite states to be neither Bell inequality violating nor dense-codeable. We show that these quantum characteristics, viz. Bell inequality violation and dense-codeability, can be resurrected, and thereby the no-go theorems overcome, by having quenched disorder in the system parameters leading to quantum spin glass or quantum random field models. We show that the quantum characteristics are regained even though the quenched averaging keeps the disordered spin chains translationally invariant at the physically relevant level of observables. The results show that it is possible to conquer constraints imposed by quantum mechanics in ordered systems by introducing impurities.

abstract: The temperature dependence of the asymmetry between Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering can be exploited for self-calibrating, optically-based thermometry. In the context of cavity optomechanics, we observe the cavity-enhanced scattering of light interacting with the standing-wave drumhead modes of a silicon nitride membrane mechanical resonator. The ratio of the amplitude of Stokes to anti-Stokes scattered light is used to measure temperatures of optically-cooled mechanical modes down to the level of a few vibrational quanta. We demonstrate that the Raman-ratio technique is able to measure the physical temperature of our device over a range extending from cryogenic temperatures to within an order of magnitude of room temperature.

The two sidebands are produced from a single laser beam and are measured simultaneously. The behavior of the sidebands agrees well with a model that includes the oscillator's zero-point motion, thermal motion, and its response to the quantum and classical fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. The oscillator's mean phonon number is inferred from the asymmetry of the sidebands as well as from a calibrated heterodyne measurement, with good agreement between the two methods.

abstract: Superconducting circuits have attracted growing interest in recent years as a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. Extensive efforts have always been taken to completely shield these circuits from external magnetic field to protect the integrity of superconductivity. Surprisingly, here we show vortices can improve the performance of superconducting qubits by reducing the lifetimes of detrimental single-electron-like excitations known as quasiparticles. Using a contactless injection technique with unprecedented dynamic range, we quantitatively distinguish between recombination and trapping mechanisms in controlling the dynamics of residual quasiparticles, and show quantized changes in quasiparticle trapping rate due to individual vortices. These results highlight the prominent role of quasiparticle trapping in future development of superconducting qubits, and provide a powerful characterization tool along the way.

abstract: Driven two-level system is a useful model to describe many quantum objects, particularly in quantum information processing. However, the exact master equation for such a system is barely explored. Making use of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional theory, we derive an exact non-Markovian master equation for the driven two-level system and show the lost feature in the perturbative treatment for this system. The perturbative treatment leads to the time-convolutionless (TCL) and the Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) master equations. So to this end, we derive the time-convolutionless (TCL) and the Nakajima-Zwanzig (NZ) master equations for the system and compare the dynamics given by the three master equations. We find the validity condition for the TCL and NZ master equations. Based on the exact non-Markovian master equation, we analyze the regime of validity for the secular approximation in the time-convolutionless master equation and discuss the leading corrections of the nonsecular terms to the quantum dynamics, significant effects are found in the dynamics of the driven system.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of mixed-species ion crystals during transport between spatially distinct locations in a linear Paul trap in the diabatic regime. In a general mixed-species crystal, all degrees of freedom along the direction of transport are excited by an accelerating well, so unlike the case of same-species ions, where only the center-of-mass-mode is excited, several degrees of freedom have to be simultaneously controlled by the transport protocol. We design protocols that lead to low final excitations in the diabatic regime using invariant-based inverse-engineering for two different-species ions and also show how to extend this approach to longer mixed-species ion strings. Fast transport of mixed-species ion strings can significantly reduce the time overhead in certain architectures for scalable quantum information processing with trapped ions.

abstract: The long time consumption is a bottleneck for the applicability of the ghost imaging (GI). By introducing a criterion for the convergence of GI, we investigate a factor that impacts on the convergence speed of it. Based on computer experiments, we demonstrate that the object's feature size relative to the spatial coherent length of the illuminating light impacts on the necessary number of uncorrelated data being acquired for the correlation computation. It may motivate people to seek ways towards real-time practical applications of GI and its analogues. In addition, the method to simulate the uncorrelated sequence of a complex ensemble for thermal light is valuable in applications where actively controlling the light fields is needed.

abstract: We study a practical method to measure the shot noise in real time in Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) systems. The amount of secret key that can be extracted from the raw statistics depends strongly on this quantity since it affects in particular the computation of the excess noise (i.e. noise in excess of the shot noise) added by an eavesdropper on the quantum channel. Some powerful quantum hacking attacks relying on faking the estimated value of the shot noise to hide an intercept and resend strategy were proposed. Here, we provide experimental evidence that our method can defeat the saturation attack and the wavelength attack.

abstract: Diagnosing the minimal set of faults capable of explaining a set of given observations, e.g., from sensor readouts, is a hard combinatorial optimization problem usually tackled with artificial intelligence techniques. We present the mapping of this combinatorial problem to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and the experimental results of instances embedded onto a quantum annealing device with 509 quantum bits. Besides being the first time a quantum approach has been proposed for problems in the advanced diagnostics community, to the best of our knowledge this work is also the first research utilizing the route Problem $\rightarrow$ QUBO $\rightarrow$ Direct embedding into quantum hardware, where we are able to implement and tackle problem instances with sizes that go beyond previously reported toy-model proof-of-principle quantum annealing implementations; this is a significant leap in the solution of problems via direct-embedding adiabatic quantum optimization. We discuss some of the programmability challenges in the current generation of the quantum device as well as a few possible ways to extend this work to more complex arbitrary network graphs.

abstract: We address the use of a single qubit as a quantum probe to characterize the properties of classical noise. In particular, we focus on the characterization of classical noise arising from the interaction with a stochastic field described by Gaussian processes. The tools of quantum estimation theory allow us to find the optimal state preparation for the probe, the optimal interaction time with the external noise, and the optimal measurement to effectively extract information on the noise parameter. We also perform a set of simulated experiments to assess the performances of maximum likelihood estimator, showing that the asymptotic regime, where the estimator is unbiased and efficient, is approximately achieved after few thousands repeated measurements on the probe system.

abstract: We introduce a new class of quantum many-particle entangled states, called the Dicke squeezed (or DS) states, which can be used to improve the precision in quantum metrology beyond the standard quantum limit. We show that the enhancement in measurement precision is characterized by a single experimentally detectable parameter, called the Dicke squeezing $\xi_{D}$, which also bounds the entanglement depth for this class of states. The measurement precision approaches the ultimate Heisenberg limit as $\xi_{D}$ attains the minimum in an ideal Dicke state. Compared with other entangled states, we show that the Dicke squeezed states are more robust to decoherence and give better measurement precision under typical experimental noise.

abstract: Hamiltonian engineering is an important approach for quantum information processing, when appropriate materials do not exist in nature or are unstable. So far there is no stable material for the Kitaev spin Hamiltonian with anisotropic interactions on a honeycomb lattice (A. Kitaev, Annals of Physics vol 321, 2 (2006)), which plays a crucial role in the realization of both Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Here, we show how to dynamically realize the Kitaev spin Hamiltonian from the conventional Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian using a pulse-control technique. By repeating the same pulse sequence, the quantum state is dynamically preserved. The effects of the spin-orbit interaction and the hyperfine interaction are also investigated.

abstract: We apply the quantum optimal control theory based on the Krotov method to implement single-qubit $X$ and $Z$ gates and two-qubit CNOT gates for inductively coupled superconducting flux qubits with fixed qubit transition frequencies and fixed off-diagonal qubit-qubit coupling. Our scheme that shares the same advantage of other directly coupling schemes requires no additional coupler subcircuit and control lines. The control lines needed are only for the manipulation of individual qubits (e.g., a time-dependent magnetic flux or field applied on each qubit). The qubits are operated at the optimal coherence points and the gate operation times (single-qubit gates $< 1$ ns; CNOT gates $\sim 2$ ns) are much shorter than the corresponding qubit decoherence time. A CNOT gate or other general quantum gates can be implemented in a single run of pulse sequence rather than being decomposed into several single-qubit and some entangled two-qubit operations in series by composite pulse sequences. Quantum gates constructed via our scheme are all with very high fidelity (very low error) as our optimal control scheme takes into account the fixed qubit detuning and fixed two-qubit interaction as well as all other time-dependent magnetic-field-induced single-qubit interactions and two-qubit couplings. The effect of leakage to higher energy-level states and the effect of qubit decoherence on the quantum gate operations are also discussed.

abstract: Controlling photon emission by single quantum emitters with nanostructures is crucial for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. Nowadays nanoresonators can affect the lifetime of emitters and ultimately induce strong coupling between the emitters and the light field, while nanoantennas can control the directionality of the emission. Expanding this control to the manipulation of the emission of orbital angular momentum-changing transitions would enable coupling between long-lived solid-state qubits and flying qubits. As these transitions are associated with circular rather than linear dipoles, such control requires detailed knowledge of the spatially dependent interaction of a complex dipole with highly structured optical eigenstates containing local helicity. Using a classical analogue, we experimentally map the coupling of circular dipoles to photonic modes in a model structure, a photonic crystal waveguide. We show that depending on the local helicity the dipoles can be made to couple to modes either propagating to the left or to the right. The maps are in excellent agreement with calculations. Our measurements, therefore, demonstrate the coupling of spin to photonic pathway with near-unity (0.8 $\pm$ 0.1) efficiency.

abstract: The temporal dynamics of stimulated emission is studied, with the particular emphasis on stimulated emission induced by x-ray pulses interacting with nuclei. In typical nuclear forward scattering experiments, the short incident x-ray pulse is accompanied by a huge number of off-resonant background photons. This prompts the question, if stimulated emission can be observed in the delayed nuclear scattering signal which is emitted after the incident pulse has passed. We find that the stimulated photons essentially overlap with the stimulating pulse. To overcome this problem, we identify the reduction of the delayed scattered light intensity as alternative signature for the stimulated emission. We further study a phase-sensitive variant of stimulated emission in the low-excitation regime, which provides convenient control parameters to facilitate the detection. Finally, we analyze the possibility to observe stimulated emission in nuclei driven by free electron lasers or synchrotron radiation sources.

abstract: We propose a new formulation of optimal and local control algorithms which enforces the constraint of time-integrated zero-area on the control field. The fulfillment of this requirement, crucial in many physical applications, is mathematically implemented by the introduction of a Lagrange multiplier aiming at penalizing the pulse area. This method allows to design a control field with an area as small as possible, while bringing the dynamical system close to the target state. We test the efficiency of this approach on two control purposes in molecular dynamics, namely, orientation and photodissociation.

abstract: We propose a Newton algorithm to characterize the Hamiltonian of a quantum system interacting with a given laser field. The algorithm is based on the assumption that the evolution operator of the system is perfectly known at a fixed time. The computational scheme uses the Crank-Nicholson approximation to explicitly determine the derivatives of the propagator with respect to the Hamiltonians of the system. In order to globalize this algorithm, we use a continuation method that improves its convergence properties. This technique is applied to a two-level quantum system and to a molecular one with a double-well potential. The numerical tests show that accurate estimates of the unknown parameters are obtained in some cases. We discuss the numerical limits of the algorithm in terms of basin of convergence and non uniqueness of the solution.

Furthermore, our criteria can be experimentally implemented and the criterion for two-qudit states requires less local measurements than the one based on mutually unbiased measurements.

abstract: Boson sampling is a simple model for non-universal linear optics quantum computing using far fewer physical resources than universal schemes. An input state comprising vacuum and single photon states is fed through a Haar-random linear optics network and sampled at the output using coincidence photodetection. This problem is strongly believed to be classically hard to simulate. We show that an analogous procedure implements the same problem, using photon-added or -subtracted squeezed vacuum states (with arbitrary squeezing), where sampling at the output is performed via parity measurements. The equivalence is exact and independent of the squeezing parameter, and hence provides an entire class of new quantum states of light in the same complexity class as boson sampling.

abstract: We provide analytic insight into the generation of stationary itinerant photon entanglement in a 3-mode optomechanical system. We identify the parameter regime of maximal entanglement, and show that strong entanglement is possible even for weak many-photon optomechanical couplings. We also show that strong tripartite entanglement is generated between the photonic and phononic output fields; unlike the bipartite photon-photon entanglement, this tripartite entanglement diverges as one approaches the boundary of system stability.

abstract: We investigate the inhibited spontaneous emission of telecom-band InAs quantum disks (Qdisks) in InP nanowires (NWs). We have evaluated how the inhibition is affected by different disk diameter and thickness. We also compared the inhibition in standing InP NWs and those NWs laying on silica (SiO2), and silicon (Si) substrates. We found that the inhibition is altered when we put the NW on the high-refractive index materials of Si. Experimentally, the inhibition factor $\zeta$ of the Qdisk emission at 1,500 nm decreases from 4.6 to 2.5 for NW on SiO2 and Si substrates, respectively. Those inhibitions are even much smaller than that of 6.4 of the standing NW. The inhibition factors well agree with those calculated from the coupling of the Qdisk to the fundamental guided mode and the continuum of radiative modes. Our observation can be useful for the integration of the NW as light sources in the photonic nanodevices.

abstract: The Landauer principle asserts that the energy cost of erasure of one bit of information by the action of a thermal reservoir in equilibrium at temperature T is never less than $kTlog 2$. We discuss Landauer's principle for quantum statistical models describing a finite level quantum system S coupled to an infinitely extended thermal reservoir R. Using Araki's perturbation theory of KMS states and the Avron-Elgart adiabatic theorem we prove, under a natural ergodicity assumption on the joint system S+R, that Landauer's bound saturates for adiabatically switched interactions. The recent work of Reeb and Wolf on the subject is discussed and compared.

abstract: Originally, the Hubbard model has been derived for describing the behaviour of strongly-correlated electrons in solids. However, since over a decade now, variations of it are also routinely being implemented with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a focus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an introduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss briefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended Bose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites, next-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the importance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding approximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the models to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects the density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site interaction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both contact and dipolar interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, also the effects related to higher Bloch bands become important even for deep optical lattices. Different approaches that aim at incorporating these effects, mainly via dressing the basis Wannier functions with interactions, leading to effective, density-dependent Hubbard-type models, are reviewed. We discuss also examples of Hubbard-like models that explicitly involve higher $p$-orbitals, as well as models that couple dynamically spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Finally, we review mean-field nonlinear-Schr\"odinger models of the Salerno type that share with the non-standard Hubbard models the nonlinear coupling between the adjacent sites. In that part, discrete solitons are the main subject of the consideration. We conclude by listing some future open problems.

abstract: We study intertwining relations for $n\times n$ matrix non-Hermitian, in general, one-dimensional Hamiltonians by $n\times n$ matrix linear differential operators with nondegenerate coefficients at $d/dx$ in the highest degree. Some methods of constructing of $n\times n$ matrix intertwining operator of the first order of general form are proposed and their interrelation is examined. As example we construct $2\times2$ matrix Hamiltonian of general form intertwined by operator of the first order with the Hamiltonian with zero matrix potential. It is shown that one can add for the final $2\times2$ matrix Hamiltonian with respect to the initial matrix Hamiltonian with the help of intertwining operator of the first order either up to two bound states for different energy values or up to two bound states described by vector-eigenfunctions for the same energy value or up to two bound states described by vector-eigenfunction and associated vector-function for the same energy value.

abstract: Electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) has been proposed as a way to greatly enhance cross-phase modulation, with the possibility of leading to few-photon-level optical nonlinearities. This enhancement grows as the transparency window width, \Delta_EIT, is narrowed. Decreasing \Delta_EIT, however, increases the response time of the effect, suggesting that for pulses of a given duration, there could be a fundamental limit to the strength of the nonlinearity. We show that in the regimes of most practical interest - narrow EIT windows perturbed by short signal pulses- the enhancement offered by EIT is not only in the magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift but in fact also in its increased duration. That is, for the case of signal pulses much shorter (temporally) than the inverse EIT bandwidth, the narrow window serves to prolong the effect of the passing signal pulse, leading to an integrated phase shift that grows linearly with \Delta_EIT even though the peak phase shift may saturate; the continued growth of the integrated phase shift improves the detectability of the phase shift, in principle without bound. For many purposes, it is this detectability which is of interest, more than the absolute magnitude of the peak phase shift. We present analytical expressions based on a linear time-invariant model that accounts for the temporal behavior of the cross-phase modulation for several parameter ranges of interest. We conclude that in order to optimize the detectability of the EIT-based cross-phase shift, one should use the narrowest possible EIT window, and a signal pulse that is as broadband as the excited state linewidth and detuned by half a linewidth.

abstract: The modified Dirac-Pauli equations, which are introduced by means of ${\gamma_5}$-mass factorization of the ordinary Klein-Gordon operator, are considered. We also take into account the interaction of fermions with the intensive homogenous magnetic field focusing attention to their (g-2) gyromagnetic factor. The basis of this approach is developing of methods for study of the structure of regions of unbroken $\cal PT$ symmetry of Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians which be no studied earlier. For that, without the use of perturbation theory in the external field the exact energy spectra are deduced with regard to spin effects of fermions. We also investigate the unique possible of experimental observability the non-Hermitian restrictions in the spectrum of mass consistent with the conjecture Markov about Maximal Mass. This, in principal will may allow to find out the existence of an upper limit value in spectrum masses of elementary particles and confirm or deny the significance of the Planck mass.

abstract: We evaluate the positive-frequency Wightman function, the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling for a cylindrical shell in background of dS spacetime. The field is prepared in the Bunch-Davies vacuum state and on the shell the corresponding operator obeys Robin boundary condition. In the region inside the shell and for non-Neumann boundary conditions, the Bunch-Davies vacuum is a physically realizable state for all values of the mass and curvature coupling parameter. For both interior and exterior regions, the VEVs are decomposed into boundary-free dS and shell-induced parts. We show that the shell-induced part of the vacuum energy-momentum tensor has a nonzero off-diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the radial direction. Unlike to the case of a shell in Minkowski bulk, for dS background the axial stresses are not equal to the energy density. In dependence of the mass and of the coefficient in the boundary condition, the vacuum energy density and the energy flux can be either positive or negative. The influence of the background gravitational field on the boundary-induced effects is crucial at distances from the shell larger than the dS curvature scale. In particular, the decay of the VEVs with the distance is power-law (monotonic or oscillatory with dependence of the mass) for both massless and massive fields. For Neumann boundary condition the decay is faster than that for non-Neumann conditions.

abstract: The role of phase space occupation effects for the formation of two- and three-particle bound states in a dense medium is investigated within an algebraic approach suitable for systems with short-range interactions. It is shown that for two-fermion bound states due to the account of the exchange symmetry (phase space occupation) effect (Pauli blocking) in a dense medium the binding energy is reduced and vanishes at a critical density (Mott effect). For three-fermion bound states, within a Faddeev equation approach, the intermediate formation of pair correlations leads to the representation as a suitably symmetrized fermion-boson bound state. It is shown that the Bose enhancement of fermion pairs can partially compensate the Pauli blocking between the fermions. This leads to the general result obtained by algebraic methods: three-fermion bound states in a medium with high phase space occupation appear necessarily as Borromean states beyond the Mott density of the two-fermion bound state.

abstract: We provide a comprehensive comparison of a coupled channels calculation, the asymptotic bound state model (ABM), and the multichannel quantum defect theory (MQDT). Quantitative results for $^6$Li -$^{133}$Cs are presented and compared to previously measured $^6$Li -$^{133}$Cs Feshbach resonances (FRs) [M. Repp et al., Phys. Rev. A 87 010701(R) (2013)]. We demonstrate how the accuracy of the ABM can be stepwise improved by including magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and coupling to a non-dominant virtual state. We present a MQDT calculation, where magnetic dipole-dipole and second order spin-orbit interactions are included. A frame transformation formalism is introduced, which allows the assignment of measured FRs with only three parameters. All three models achieve a total rms error of < 1G on the observed FRs. We critically compare the different models in view of the accuracy for the description of FRs and the required input parameters for the calculations.

abstract: Caustics are optical phenomena which occur when a family of rays creates an envelope of divergent intensity. Here we show that caustic surfaces also appear when a real or complex field is mapped to its order parameter manifold. We study these structures in the context of spin-1/2 fields, where the order parameter manifold is the Bloch sphere. These generic structures are a manifestation of catastrophe theory and are stable with respect to perturbations. The corresponding field configurations are also stable and represent a new type of topological defect. Equations governing the conditions for their existence and unfolding are derived.

abstract: Topological order in a 2d quantum matter can be determined by the topological contribution to the entanglement R\'enyi entropies. However, when close to a quantum phase transition, its calculation becomes cumbersome. Here we show how topological phase transitions in 2d systems can be much better assessed by multipartite entanglement, as measured by the topological geometric entanglement of blocks. Specifically, we present an efficient tensor network algorithm based on Projected Entangled Pair States to compute this quantity for a torus partitioned into cylinders, and then use this method to find sharp evidence of topological phase transitions in 2d systems with a string-tension perturbation. When compared to tensor network methods for R\'enyi entropies, our approach produces almost perfect accuracies close to criticality and, on top, is orders of magnitude faster. The method can be adapted to deal with any topological state of the system, including minimally entangled ground states. It also allows to extract the critical exponent of the correlation length, and shows that there is no continuous entanglement-loss along renormalization group flows in topological phases.

abstract: The status of the photon in the modern physics was analysed. Within the frames of the Standard Model of particle physics the photon is considered to be the genuine elementary particle, being to be the messenger of the electromagnetic interaction to which are subject charged particles. In contrast, the experts in quantum electodynamics (in particular, in quantum optics) insist, that the description of an photon to be the particle is impossible. The given viewpoint was carefully analysed and its falseness was proved. The expression for a photon wave function is presented. So, the status of the photon in quantum electodynamics was restored. The physics of a quantum absorption process is analysed. It is argued in accordance with Dirac guess, that the photon revival takes place by its absorption. Being to be a soliton, it seems to be keeping safe after an energy absorption in a pinned state, possessing the only by spin. It is shown, that the time of the transfer of absorbing systems in an excited state is finite and moreover, that it can govern the stationary signal registered. The given result is significant for the all stationary spectroscopy, in which at present the transfer of absorbing systems in an excited state is considered to be instantaneous.

abstract: Vacuum polarization (or Casimir) energies can be straightforwardly computed from scattering data for static field configurations whose interactions with the fluctuating field are frequency independent. In effective theories, however,such interactions are typically frequency dependent. As a consequence, the relationship between scattering data and the Green's function is modified, which may or may not induce additional contributions to the vacuum polarization energy. We discuss several examples that naturally include frequency dependent interactions: (i) scalar electrodynamics with a static background potential, (ii) an effective theory that emerges from integrating out a heavy degree of freedom, and (iii) quantum electrodynamics coupled to a frequency dependent dielectric material. In the latter case, we argue that introducing dissipation as required by the Kramers-Kronig relations requires the consideration of the Casimir energy within a statistical mechanics formalism, while in the absence of dissipation we can work entirely within field theory, using an alternative formulation of the energy density.

abstract: We study many-party correlations quantified in terms of the Umegaki relative entropy (divergence) from a Gibbs family known as a hierarchical model. We derive these quantities from the maximum-entropy principle which was used earlier to define the closely related irreducible correlation. We point out differences between quantum states and probability vectors which exist in hierarchical models, in the divergence from a hierarchical model and in local maximizers of this divergence. The differences are, respectively, missing factorization, discontinuity and reduction of uncertainty. We discuss global maximizers of the mutual information of separable qubit states.

abstract: By applying complementary analytic and numerical methods, we investigate the dynamics of spin-$1/2$ XXZ models with variable-range interactions in arbitrary dimensions. The dynamics we consider is initiated from uncorrelated states that are easily prepared in experiments, and can be equivalently viewed as either Ramsey spectroscopy or a quantum quench. Our primary focus is the dynamical emergence of correlations and entanglement in these far-from-equilibrium interacting quantum systems: we characterize these correlations by the entanglement entropy, concurrence, and squeezing, which are inequivalent measures of entanglement corresponding to different quantum resources. In one spatial dimension, we show that the time evolution of correlation functions manifests a non-perturbative dynamic singularity. This singularity is characterized by a universal power-law exponent that is insensitive to small perturbations. Explicit realizations of these models in current experiments using polar molecules, trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, magnetic atoms, and alkaline-earth and alkali atoms in optical lattices, along with the relative merits and limitations of these different systems, are discussed.

abstract: The exact critical Casimir force between periodically deformed boundaries of a 2D semi-infinite strip is obtained for conformally invariant classical systems. Only two parameters (conformal charge and scaling dimension of a boundary changing operator), along withthe solution of an electrostatic problem, determine the Casimir force, rendering the theory practically applicable to any shape and arrangement. The attraction between any two mirror symmetric objects follows directly from our general result. The possibility of purely shape induced reversal of the force, as well as occurrence of stable equilibrium points, is demonstrated for certain conformally invariant models, including the tricritical Ising model.

abstract: We demonstrate multiphoton blockades (PB) in the pulsed regime by using Kerr nonlinear dissipative resonator driven by a sequence of Gaussian pulses. It is shown that the results obtained for single-photon, two-photon and three-photon blockades in the pulsed excitation regime differ considerably from analogous results obtained for the case of continuous-wave (cw) driving. We strongly demonstrate that for the case of cw pumping of the Kerr-nonlinear resonator there are fundamental limits on populations of lower photonic number-states (with n = 0, 1, 2, 3). Thus, such detailed comparison demonstrates that PB due to excitation with a suitable photon pulses is realized beyond the fundamental limits established for cw excitations. We analyze photon-number effects and investigate phase-space properties of PB on the base of photon number populations, the second-order correlation functions and the Wigner functions in phase space. Generation of Fock states due to PB in the pulsed regime is analysed in details.

abstract: We prove Haag duality for conelike regions in the ground state representation of Kitaev's quantum double model for finite abelian groups. This property says that if an observable commutes with all observables localised outside the cone region, it actually is an element of the von Neumann algebra generated by the local observables inside the cone. This strengthens locality, which says that observables localised in disjoint regions commute. As an application we consider the superselection structure of the quantum double model for abelian groups on an infinite lattice in the spirit of the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts program in algebraic quantum field theory. We find that, as is the case for the toric code model on an infinite lattice, the superselection structure is given by the category of irreducible representations of the quantum double.

abstract: The mechanism of electron-hole separation in organic solar cells is currently hotly debated. Recent experimental work suggests that these charges can separate on extremely short timescales (<100 fs). This can be understood in terms of delocalised transport within fullerene aggregates, which is thought to emerge on short timescales before vibronic relaxation induces polaron formation. However, in the optimal heterojunction morphology, electrons and holes will often re-encounter each other before reaching the electrodes. If such charges trap and cannot separate, then device efficiency will suffer. Here we extend the theory of ultrafast charge separation to incorporate polaron formation, and find that the same delocalised transport used to explain ultrafast charge separation can account for the suppression of nongeminate recombination in the best devices.

Our modification is largely suppressed for purely gravitational interactions, it becomes relevant under non-gravitational accelerations of the sources. We illustrate how the choice $\tau_G\sim1$ms may already influence the 5th digit of G determined by Cavendish experiments. Re-evaluation of old Cavendish experiments and implementing slightly modified new ones may confirm the proposal or, at least, put a stronger upper limit on $\tau_G$.

abstract: In the context of characterizing the structure of quantum entanglement in many-body systems, we introduce the entanglement contour, a tool to identify which real-space degrees of freedom contribute, and how much, to the entanglement of a region A with the rest of the system B. The entanglement contour provides a complementary, more re?fined approach to characterizing entanglement than just considering the entanglement entropy between A and B, with several concrete advantages. We illustrate this in the context of ground states and quantum quenches in fermionic quadratic systems. For instance, in a quantum critical system in $D = 1$ spatial dimensions, the entanglement contour allows us to determine the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory from just a single partition of the system into regions A and B, (using the entanglement entropy for the same task requires considering several partitions). In $D \geq 2$ dimensions, the entanglement contour can distinguish between gapped and gapless phases that obey a same boundary law for entanglement entropy. During a local or global quantum quench, the time-dependent contour provides a detailed account of the dynamics of entanglement, including propagating entanglement waves, which offers a microscopic explanation of the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a function of time.

abstract: The control of exciton transport in organic materials is of fundamental importance for the development of efficient light-harvesting systems. This transport is easily deteriorated by traps in the disordered energy landscape. Here, we propose and analyze a system that supports topological Frenkel exciton edge states. Backscattering of these chiral Frenkel excitons is prohibited by symmetry, ensuring that the transport properties of such a system are robust against disorder. To implement our idea, we propose a two-dimensional periodic array of tilted porphyrins interacting with a homogenous magnetic field. This field serves to break time-reversal symmetry and results in lattice fluxes that that mimic the Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired by electrons. Our proposal is the first blueprint for realizing topological phases of matter in molecular aggregates and suggests a paradigm for engineering novel excitonic materials.

abstract: One-time-pad (OTP) encryption simply cannot be cracked, even by a quantum computer. The need of sharing in a secure way supplies of symmetric random keys turned the method almost obsolete as a standing-alone method for fast and large volume telecommunication. Basically, this secure sharing of keys and their renewal, once exhausted, had to be done through couriers, in a slow and costly process. This paper presents a solution for this problem providing a fast and unlimited renewal of secure keys: An untappable key distribution system is presented and detailed. This fast key distribution system utilizes two layers of confidentially protection: 1) Physical noise intrinsic to the optical channel that turn the coded signals into stealth signals and 2) Privacy amplification using a bit pool of refreshed entropy run after run, to eliminate any residual information. The resulting level of security is rigorously calculated and demonstrates that the level of information an eavesdropper could obtain is completely negligible. The random bit sequences, fast and securely distributed, can be used to encrypt text, data or voice.

abstract: We consider a non-relativistic quantum gas of $N$ bosonic atoms confined to a box of volume $\Lambda$ in physical space. The atoms interact with each other through a pair potential whose strength is inversely proportional to the density, $\rho=\frac{N}{\Lambda}$, of the gas. We study the time evolution of coherent excitations above the ground state of the gas in a regime of large volume $\Lambda$ and small ratio $\frac{\Lambda}{\rho}$. The initial state of the gas is assumed to be close to a \textit{product state} of one-particle wave functions that are approximately constant throughout the box. The initial one-particle wave function of an excitation is assumed to have a compact support independent of $\Lambda$. We derive an effective non-linear equation for the time evolution of the one-particle wave function of an excitation and establish an explicit error bound tracking the accuracy of the effective non-linear dynamics in terms of the ratio $\frac{\Lambda}{\rho}$. We conclude with a discussion of the dispersion law of low-energy excitations, recovering Bogolyubov's well-known formula for the speed of sound in the gas, and a dynamical instability for attractive two-body potentials.

Scattering and reflection of electromagnetic waves in three different homogeneous layers of media is determined. Snell's law is preserved. However, the transmission and reflection coefficient depend on the strength of the Chern-Simons interaction, and parallel and perpendicular components are mixed.

abstract: The efficient cooling of the nanomechanical resonators is essential to exploration of quantum properties of the macroscopic or mesoscopic systems. We propose such a laser-cooling scheme for a nanomechanical cantilever, which works even for the low-frequency mechanical mode and under weak cooling lasers. The cantilever is attached by a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center under a strong magnetic field gradient and the cooling is assisted by a dynamical Stark-shift gate. Our scheme can effectively enhance the desired cooling efficiency by avoiding the off-resonant and unexpected carrier transitions, and thereby cool the cantilever down to the vicinity of the vibrational ground state in a fast fashion.

abstract: We present a novel lambda calculus that casts the categorical approach to the study of quantum protocols into the rich and well established tradition of type theory. Our construction extends the linear typed lambda calculus with a linear negation of "trivialised" De Morgan duality. Reduction is realised through explicit substitution, based on a symmetric notion of binding of global scope, with rules acting on the entire typing judgement instead of on a specific subterm. Proofs of subject reduction, confluence, strong normalisation and consistency are provided, and the language is shown to be an internal language for dagger compact categories.

abstract: In this study, approximate analytical solution of Schr\"odinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations under the Tietz-Wei (TW) diatomic molecular potential are represented by using an approximation for the centrifugal term. We have applied three types of eigensolution techniques; the functional analysis approach (FAA), supersymmetry quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) and asymptotic iteration method (AIM) to solve Klein-Gordon Dirac and Schr\"odinger equations, respectively. The energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions for these three wave equations are obtained and some numerical results and figures are reported. It has been shown that these techniques yielded exactly same results. some expectation values of the TW diatomic molecular potential within the framework of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem (HFT) have been presented. The probability distributions which characterize the quantum-mechanical states of TW diatomic molecular potential are analysed by means of complementary information measures of a probability distribution called the Fishers information entropy. This distribution has been described in terms of Jacobi polynomials, whose characteristics are controlled by the quantum numbers.

abstract: We describe an ex-situ surface-cleaning procedure that is shown to reduce motional heating from ion-trap electrodes. This precleaning treatment, to be implemented immediately before the final assembly and vacuum processing of ion traps, removes surface contaminants remaining after the electrode-fabrication process. We incorporate a multi-angle ion-bombardment treatment intended to clean the electrode surfaces and interelectrode gaps of microfabricated traps. This procedure helps to minimize redeposition in the gaps between electrodes that can cause electrical shorts. We report heating rates in a stylus-type ion trap prepared in this way that are lower by one order of magnitude compared to a similar untreated stylus-type trap using the same experimental setup.

This storage resonator is addressed through a second, coupling resonator, which is frequency-tunable and controlled by a magnetic flux applied to a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). We experimentally demonstrate that the lifetime of the storage resonator can be tuned by more than three orders of magnitude. A field can be stored for 18 {\mu}s when the coupling resonator is tuned off resonance and it can be released in 14 ns when the coupling resonator is tuned on resonance. The device allows capture, storage, and on-demand release of microwaves at a tunable rate.

abstract: The black hole information paradox arises from an apparent conflict between the Hawking black hole radiation and the fact that time evolution in quantum mechanics is unitary. The trouble is that while the former suggests that information of a system falling into a black hole disappears, the latter implies that information must be conserved. In this work we discuss the current divergence in views regarding the paradox, we evaluate the role that objective collapse theories could play in its resolution and we propose a link between spontaneous collapse events and microscopic virtual black holes.

abstract: A stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation is derived for partially condensed Bose gas systems subject to binary contact interactions. The theory we present provides a classical-field theory suitable for describing dissipative dynamics and phase transitions of spinor and multi-component Bose gas systems comprised of an arbitrary number of distinct interacting Bose fields. A new class of dissipative processes involving distinguishable particle interchange between coherent and incoherent regions of phase-space is identified. The formalism and its implications are illustrated for two-component mixtures and spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates. For systems comprised of atoms of equal mass, with thermal reservoirs that are close to equilibrium, the dissipation rates of the theory are reduced to analytical expressions that may be readily evaluated. The unified treatment of binary contact interactions presented here provides a theory with broad relevance for quasi-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates.

abstract: We experimentally realize an enhanced Raman control scheme for neutral atoms that features an intrinsic suppression of the two-photon carrier transition, but retains the sidebands which couple to the external degrees of freedom of the trapped atoms. This is achieved by trapping the atom at the node of a blue detuned standing wave dipole trap, that acts as one field for the two-photon Raman coupling. The improved ratio between cooling and heating processes in this configuration enables a five times lower fundamental temperature limit for resolved sideband cooling. We apply this method to perform Raman cooling to the two-dimensional vibrational ground state and to coherently manipulate the atomic motion. The presented scheme requires minimal additional resources and can be applied to experiments with challenging optical access, as we demonstrate by our implementation for atoms strongly coupled to an optical cavity.

abstract: A continuous family of quasilocal exact conservation laws is constructed in the anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) spin-1/2 chain for periodic (or twisted) boundary conditions and for a set of commensurate anisotropies densely covering the entire easy plane interaction regime. All local conserved operators follow from the standard (Hermitian) transfer operator in fundamental representation (with auxiliary spin s=1/2), and are all even with respect to a spin flip operation. However, the quasilocal family is generated by differentiation of a non-Hermitian highest weight transfer operator with respect to a complex auxiliary spin representation parameter s and includes also operators of odd parity. For a finite chain with open boundaries the time derivatives of quasilocal operators are not strictly vanishing but result in operators localized near the boundaries of the chain. We show that a simple modification of the non-Hermitian transfer operator results in exactly conserved, but still quasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary conditions. As an application, we demonstrate that implementing the new exactly conserved operator family for estimating the high-temperature spin Drude weight results, in the thermodynamic limit, in exactly the same lower bound as for almost conserved family and open boundaries. Under the assumption that the bound is saturating (suggested by agreement with previous thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations) we propose a simple explicit construction of infinite time averages of local operators such as the spin current.

abstract: We present an optical setup with focus-tunable lenses to dynamically control the waist and focus position of a laser beam, in which we transport a trapped ultracold cloud of 87-Rb over a distance of 28 cm. The scheme allows us to shift the focus position at constant waist, providing uniform trapping conditions over the full transport length. The fraction of atoms that are transported over the entire distance comes near to unity, while the heating of the cloud is in the range of a few microkelvin. We characterize the position stability of the focus and show that residual drift rates in focus position can be compensated for by counteracting with the tunable lenses. Beyond being a compact and robust scheme to transport ultracold atoms, the reported control of laser beams makes dynamic tailoring of trapping potentials possible. As an example, we steer the size of the atomic cloud by changing the waist size of the dipole beam.

Using "resonant phase matching," we design a compact superconducting device consisting of a transmission line with subwavelength resonant inclusions that simultaneously achieves a gain of 20 dB, an instantaneous bandwidth of 3 GHz, and a saturation power of -98 dBm. Such an amplifier is well-suited to cryogenic broadband microwave measurements such as the multiplexed readout of quantum coherent circuits based on superconducting, semiconducting, or nano-mechanical elements as well as traditional astronomical detectors.

abstract: Picard--Lefschetz theory is applied to path integrals of quantum mechanics, in order to compute real-time dynamics directly. After discussing basic properties of real-time path integrals on Lefschetz thimbles, we demonstrate its computational method in a concrete way by solving three simple examples of quantum mechanics. It is applied to quantum mechanics of a double-well potential, and quantum tunneling is discussed. We identify all of the complex saddle points of the classical action, and their properties are discussed in detail. However a big theoretical difficulty turns out to appear in rewriting the original path integral into a sum of path integrals on Lefschetz thimbles. We discuss generality of that problem and mention its importance. Real-time tunneling processes are shown to be described by those complex saddle points, and thus semi-classical description of real-time quantum tunneling becomes possible on solid ground if we could solve that problem.

abstract: The second-order differential equation for a damped harmonic oscillator can be converted to two coupled first-order equations, with two two-by-two matrices leading to the group $Sp(2)$. It is shown that this oscillator system contains the essential features of Wigner's little groups dictating the internal space-time symmetries of particles in the Lorentz-covariant world. The little groups are the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose transformations leave the four-momentum of a given particle invariant. It is shown that the damping modes of the oscillator correspond to the little groups for massive and imaginary-mass particles respectively. When the system makes the transition from the oscillation to damping mode, it corresponds to the little group for massless particles. Rotations around the momentum leave the four-momentum invariant. This degree of freedom extends the $Sp(2)$ symmetry to that of $SL(2,c)$ corresponding to the Lorentz group applicable to the four-dimensional Minkowski space. The Poincar\'e sphere contains the $SL(2,c)$ symmetry. In addition, it has a non-Lorentzian parameter allowing us to reduce the mass continuously to zero. It is thus possible to construct the little group for massless particles from that of the massive particle by reducing its mass to zero. Spin-1/2 particles and spin-1 particles are discussed in detail.

abstract: Motion of randomly-driven quantum nonlinear pendulum is considered. Utilizing one-step Poincar\'e map, we demonstrate that classical phase space corresponding to a single realization of the random perturbation involves domains of finite-time stability. Statistical analysis of the finite-time evolution operator (FTEO) is carried out in order to study influence of finite-time stability on quantum dynamics. It is shown that domains of finite-time stability give rise to ordered patterns in distributions of FTEO eigenfunctions. Transition to global chaos is accompanied by smearing of these patterns; however, some of their traces survive on relatively long timescales.

abstract: We study an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector that is coupled to the proper time derivative of a real scalar field in 1+1 spacetime dimensions. Working within first-order perturbation theory, we cast the transition probability into a regulator-free form, and we show that the transition rate remains well defined in the limit of sharp switching. The detector is insensitive to the infrared ambiguity when the field becomes massless, and we verify explicitly the regularity of the massless limit for a static detector in Minkowski half-space. We then consider a massless field for two scenarios of interest for the Hawking-Unruh effect: an inertial detector in Minkowski spacetime with an exponentially receding mirror, and an inertial detector in $(1+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel and Unruh vacua. In the mirror spacetime the transition rate traces the onset of an energy flux from the mirror, with the expected Planckian late time asymptotics. In the Schwarzschild spacetime the transition rate of a detector that falls in from infinity gradually loses thermality, diverging near the singularity proportionally to $r^{-3/2}$.

abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence relates quantum entanglement between boundary Conformal Field Theories and geometric connections in the dual asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space-time. We consider entangled states in the n-fold tensor product of a 1+1 dimensional CFT Hilbert space defined by the Euclidean path integral over a Riemann surface with n holes. In one region of moduli space, the dual bulk state is a black hole with n asymptotically AdS_3 regions connected by a common wormhole, while in other regions the bulk fragments into disconnected components. We study the entanglement structure and compute the wave function explicitly in the puncture limit of the Riemann surface in terms of CFT n-point functions. We also use AdS minimal surfaces to measure entanglement more generally. In some regions of the moduli space the entanglement is entirely multipartite, though not of the GHZ type. However, even when the bulk is completely connected, in some regions of the moduli space the entanglement is almost entirely bipartite: significant entanglement occurs only between pairs of CFTs. We develop new tools to analyze intrinsically n-partite entanglement, and use these to show that for some wormholes with n similar sized horizons there is intrinsic entanglement between at least n-1 parties, and that the distillable entanglement between the asymptotic regions is at least (n+1)/2 partite.

abstract: We introduce a variational algorithm to simulate quantum many-body states based on a tree tensor network ansatz which releases the isometry constraint usually imposed by the real-space renormalization coarse-graining: This additional numerical freedom, combined with the loop-free topology of the tree network, allows one to maximally exploit the internal gauge invariance of tensor networks, ultimately leading to a computationally flexible and efficient algorithm able to treat open and periodic boundary conditions on the same footing. We benchmark the novel approach against the 1D Ising model in transverse field with periodic boundary conditions and discuss the strategy to cope with the broken translational invariance generated by the network structure. We then perform investigations on a state-of-the-art problem, namely the bilinear-biquadratic model in the transition between dimer and ferromagnetic phases. Our results clearly display an exponentially diverging correlation length and thus support the most recent guesses on the peculiarity of the transition.

abstract: The investigation of nonequilibrium dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems has emerged as a key approach to characterize the nature of quantum states, to study excitation spectra, and to shed light on thermalization processes. So far, research on nonequilibrium dynamics has focused on many-body quantum states of bosonic particles, leading to the observation of coherent quench dynamics and the exploration of relaxation and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. Here we report on the observation of coherent quench dynamics in a many-body quantum state of fermionic particles. In the experiment, we prepare a metallic state of ultracold spin-polarized fermionic atoms in a shallow three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice. The delocalized fermions are in contact with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that is simultaneously loaded into the lattice. With a rapid increase of lattice depth, we take the system out of equilibrium and induce quench dynamics that is driven by the interactions between fermions and bosons. We observe the time evolution of the fermionic momentum distribution, which shows long-lived coherent oscillations for up to ten periods, both for attractive and repulsive Fermi-Bose interactions. A theoretical model reveals that the dynamics arises as a consequence of the delocalized nature of the initial fermionic state and the on-site number fluctuations of the BEC. Our work demonstrates that coherent quench dynamics constitutes a powerful technique to gain insight into the nature of fermionic quantum many-body states and to accurately determine Hamiltonian parameters used in their microscopic description.

abstract: A general approach is presented for quantizing a metric nonlinear system on a manifold of constant curvature. It makes use of a curvature dependent procedure which relies on determining Noether symmetries from the metric. The curvature of the space functions as a constant parameter. For a specific metric which defines the manifold, Lie differentiation of the metric gives these symmetries. A metric is used such that the resulting Schrodinger equation can be solved in terms of hypergeometric functions. This permits the investigation of both the energy spectrum and wave functions exactly for this system.

The dimensions of the orthogonal spaces are finite. These q-orthogonal polynomials are expressed in terms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials and their certain limit forms.

abstract: We present quantum observable Markov decision processes (QOMDPs), the quantum analogues of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In a QOMDP, an agent's state is represented as a quantum state and the agent can choose a superoperator to apply. This is similar to the POMDP belief state, which is a probability distribution over world states and evolves via a stochastic matrix. We show that the existence of a policy of at least a certain value has the same complexity for QOMDPs and POMDPs in the polynomial and infinite horizon cases. However, we also prove that the existence of a policy that can reach a goal state is decidable for goal POMDPs and undecidable for goal QOMDPs.

abstract: We study the effect of laser photon merging, or equivalently high harmonic generation, in the quantum vacuum subject to inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields. Such a process is facilitated by the effective nonlinear couplings arising from charged particle-antiparticle fluctuations in the quantum vacuum subject to strong electromagnetic fields. We derive explicit results for general kinematic and polarization configurations involving optical photons. Concentrating on merged photons in reflected channels which are preferable in experiments for reasons of noise suppression, we demonstrate that photon merging is typically dominated by the competing nonlinear process of quantum reflection, though appropriate polarization and signal filtering could specifically search for the merging process. As a byproduct, we devise a novel systematic expansion of the photon polarization tensor in plane wave fields.

abstract: We study entanglement entropy (EE) for a Maxwell field in 2+1 dimensions. We do numerical calculations in two dimensional lattices. This gives a concrete example of the general results of our recent work on entropy for lattice gauge fields using an algebraic approach. To evaluate the entropies we extend the standard calculation methods for the entropy of Gaussian states in canonical commutation algebras to the more general case of algebras with center and arbitrary numerical commutators. We find that while the entropy depends on the details of the algebra choice, mutual information has a well defined continuum limit. We study several universal terms for the entropy of the Maxwell field and compare with the case of a massless scalar field. We find some interesting new phenomena: An "evanescent" logarithmically divergent term in the entropy with topological coefficient which does not have any correspondence with ultraviolet entanglement in the universal quantities, and a non standard way in which strong subadditivity is realized. Based on the results of our calculations we propose a generalization of strong subadditivity for the entropy on some algebras that are not in tensor product.

abstract: Integrability of a square billiard is spontaneously broken as it rotates about one of its corners. The system becomes quasi-integrable where the invariant tori are broken with respect to a certain parameter, $\lambda = 2E/\omega^{2}$ where E is the energy of the particle inside the billiard and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of rotation of billiard. We study the system classically and quantum mechanically in view of obtaining a correspondence in the two descriptions. Classical phase space in Poincar\'{e} surface of section shows transition from regular to chaotic motion as the parameter $\lambda$ is decreased. In the Quantum counterpart, the spectral statistics shows a transition from Poisson to Wigner distribution as the system turns chaotic with decrease in $\lambda$. The wavefunction statistics however show breakdown of time-reversal symmetry as $\lambda$ decreases.

abstract: We study entanglement via the subsystem purity relative to bipartitions of arbitrary excited states in (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, equivalent to the scaling limit of one dimensional quantum critical systems. We compute the exact subpurity as a function of the relative subsystem size for numerous excited states in the Ising and three-state Potts models. We find that it decays exponentially when the system and the subsystem sizes are comparable until a saturation limit is reached near half-partitioning, signaling that excited states are maximally entangled. The exponential behavior translates into extensivity for the second R\'enyi entropy. Since the coefficient of this linear law depends only on the excitation energy, this result shows an interesting, new relationship between energy and quantum information and elucidates the role of microscopic details.

Contrary to earlier attempts, we show that the degeneracy of the energy spectrum can occur for all possible values of $sm$. In an additional analysis, we also show that an isolated bound state solution, excluded from Sturm-Liouville problem, exists.

abstract: A proof that minimum uncertainty states of the simplest periodic quantum system exist in a state space that is represented by a Colombeau algebra of generalised functions but not in Hilbert space or in the space of Schwartz distributions is given. There are two significant generalisations of Hilbert space that lead to the special Colombeau algebra. The first step is to a vector space of Schwartz distributions that contains the eigenstates of operators with continuous spectra, the second is to a Colombeau algebra that provides a solution for a differential equation with non-constant coefficients. From the perspective of Colombeau algebra a rigged Hilbert space of Schwartz distributions can be understood as a representation of the linear component of the algebra. The utility of this representation is illustrated by a proof that generalised eigen-decompositions exist for linear operators with periodic continuous spectra.

abstract: We present cavity QED experiments with an Er:YSO crystal magnetically coupled to a 3D cylindrical sapphire loaded copper resonator. Such waveguide cavities are promising for the realization of a superconducting quantum processor. Here, we demonstrate the coherent integration of a rare-earth spin ensemble with the 3D architecture. The collective coupling strength of the Er$^{3+}$ spins to the 3D cavity is 21 MHz. The cylindrical sapphire loaded resonator allowed us to explore the anisotropic collective coupling between the rare-earth doped crystal and the cavity. This work shows the potential of spin doped solids in 3D quantum circuits for application as microwave quantum memories as well as for prospective microwave to optical interfaces.

abstract: We analyze doubly magic trapping of Cs hyperfine transitions including previously neglected contributions from the ground state hyperpolarizability and the interaction of the laser light and a static magnetic field. Extensive numerical searches do not reveal any doubly magic trapping conditions for any pair of hyperfine states. However, including the hyperpolarizability reveals light intensity insensitive traps for a wide range of wavelengths at specific intensities. We then investigate the possibility of using bichromatic trapping light fields. Deploying a bichromatic scheme, we demonstrate doubly magic red and blue detuned traps for pairs of states separated by one or two single photon transitions.

abstract: We investigate the inhomogeneous unitary Fermi gas and use the long-wavelength properties to predict the energies of small clusters of unitary fermions trapped in harmonic potentials. The large pairing gap and scale invariance place severe restrictions on the form of the density functional. We determine the relevant universal constants needed to constrain the functional from calculations of the bulk in oscillating external potentials. Comparing with exact Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we find that the same functional correctly predicts the lack of shell closures for small clusters of fermions trapped in harmonic wells as well as their absolute energies. A rapid convergence to the bulk limit in three dimensions, where the surface to volume ratio is quite large, is demonstrated. The resulting functional can be tested experimentally, and is a key ingredient in predicting possible polarized superfluid phases and the properties of the unitary Fermi gas in optical lattices.

abstract: Using the fractional statistical properties of so-called anyonic particles, we present exact solutions for up to six strongly interacting particles in one-dimensional confinement that interpolate the usual bosonic and fermionic limits. Specifically, we consider two-component mixtures of anyons and use these to eludicate the mixing-demixing properties of both balanced and imbalanced systems. Importantly, we demonstrate that the degree of demixing depends sensitively on the external trap in which the particles are confined. We also show how one may in principle probe the statistical parameter of an anyonic system by injection a strongly interacting impurity and doing spectral or tunneling measurements.

abstract: We study the thermally fluctuating state of a bi-layer cuprate superconductor under the periodic action of a staggered field oscillating at optical frequencies. This analysis distills essential elements of the recently discovered phenomenon of light enhanced coherence in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, which was achieved by periodically driving infrared active apical oxygen distortions. The effect of a staggered periodic perturbation is studied using a Langevin and Fokker-Planck description of driven, coupled Josephson junctions, which represent two neighboring pairs of layers and their two plasmons. In a toy model including only two junctions, we demonstrate that the external driving leads to a suppression of phase fluctuations of the low-energy plasmon, an effect which is amplified via the resonance of the high energy plasmon. When extending the modeling to the full layers, we find that this reduction becomes far more pronounced, with a striking suppression of the low-energy fluctuations, as visible in the power spectrum. We also find that this effect acts onto the in-plane fluctuations, which are reduced on long length scales. All these findings provide a physical framework to describe light control in cuprates.

abstract: Parikh and Wilczek formulated Hawking radiation as quantum tunneling across the event horizon proving the spectrum to be nonthermal. These nonthermality factors emerging due to back reaction effects have been claimed to be responsible for correlations among the emitted quanta. It has been proposed by several authors in literature that these correlations actually carry out information locked in a black hole and hence provide a resolution to the long debated black hole information paradox. This paper demonstrates that this is a fallacious proposition. Finally, it formulates the implications of the no-hair theorem in the context of Parikh-Wilczek spectrum.

abstract: We describe how a structured photonic medium controls the spontaneous emission rate from an excited quantum dot in the presence of electron-phonon coupling. We analyze this problem using a polaron transformed master equation and we consider specific examples of a photonic crystal cavity and a coupled cavity waveguide. We find that when the relaxation times of the photon and phonon baths are comparable, phonons influence spontaneous emission in a non-trivial way. We demonstrate why and how the broadband frequency dependence of the local photon density of states determines the photon emission rate, manifesting in a complete breakdown of Fermi's golden rule. For a single cavity resonance, we generalize Purcell's formula to include the effects of electron-phonon coupling. For a waveguide, we show a suppression and a 200-fold enhancement of the photon emission rate.

We discuss the relation between signals from a given QD ensemble under strong and weak excitation (full inversion and linear response regimes): A system homogeneous enough to manifest superradiant emission when strongly inverted shows a non-exponential decay of the PL signal under spatially coherent weak excitation. In an inhomogeneous ensemble the PL decay is always nearly exponential with a qualitatively different form of the time dependence in the two excitation regimes and with a higher rate under weak excitation.

abstract: Self-assembled quantum dots are ideal structures in which to test theories of open quantum systems: Confined exciton states can be coherently manipulated and their decoherence properties are dominated by interactions with acoustic phonons. We here describe the interaction of a pair of un-coupled, driven, quantum dot excitons with a common phonon environment, and find that this coupling effectively generates two kinds of interaction between the two quantum dots: An elastic coupling mediated by virtual phonons and an inelastic coupling mediated by real phonons. We show that both of these interactions produce steady state entanglement between the two quantum dot excitons. We also show that photon correlations in the emission of the quantum dots can provide a signature of the common environment. Experiments to demonstrate our predictions are feasible with the state-of-the-art technology and would provide valuable insight into quantum dot carrier-phonon dynamics.

abstract: We report the experimental observation of Coherent Population Oscillation (CPO) based light storage in an atomic vapor cell at room temperature. Using the ultranarrow CPO between the ground levels of a $\Lambda$ system selected by polarization in metastable $^4$He, such a light storage is experimentally shown to be phase preserving. As it does not involve any atomic coherences it has the advantage of being robust to dephasing effects such as small magnetic field inhomogeneities. The storage time is limited by the population lifetime of the ground states of the $\Lambda$ system.

abstract: We present a semiclassical quantization condition, i.e., quantum-classical correspondence, for steady states of nonadiabatic systems consisting of fast and slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) by extending Gutzwiller's trace formula to a nonadiabatic form. The quantum-classical correspondence indicates that a set of primitive hopping periodic orbits, which are invariant under time evolution in the phase space of the slow DOF, should be quantized. The semiclassical quantization is then applied to a simple nonadiabatic model and accurately reproduces exact quantum energy levels. In addition to the semiclassical quantization condition, we also discuss chaotic dynamics involved in the classical limit of nonadiabatic dynamics.

abstract: This paper presents the calculation of the electric transition dipole moment in a pre-Born-Oppenheimer framework. Electrons and nuclei are treated equally in terms of the parametrization of the non-relativistic total wave function, which is written as a linear combination of basis functions constructed with explicitly correlated Gaussian functions and the global vector representation. The integrals of the electric transition dipole moment are derived corresponding to these basis functions in both the length and the velocity representation. The complete derivation and the calculations are performed in laboratory-fixed Cartesian coordinates without relying on coordinates which separate the center of mass from the translationally invariant degrees of freedom. The effect of the overall motion is eliminated via translationally invariant integral expressions. As a numerical example the electric transition dipole moment is calculated between two rovibronic levels of the H2 molecule assignable to the lowest rovibrational states of the X ^1Sigma^+_g and B ^1Sigma^+_u electronic states in the clamped-nuclei framework. This is the first evaluation of this quantity in a full quantum mechanical treatment without relying on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

abstract: We consider a coupled system of Schr\"odinger equations, arising in quantum mechanics via the so-called time-dependent self-consistent field method. Using Wigner transformation techniques we study the corresponding classical limit dynamics in two cases. In the first case, the classical limit is only taken in one of the two equations, leading to a mixed quantum-classical model which is closely connected to the well-known Ehrenfest method in molecular dynamics. In the second case, the classical limit of the full system is rigorously established, resulting in a system of coupled Vlasov-type equations. In the second part of our work, we provide a numerical study of the coupled semi-classically scaled Schr\"odinger equations and of the mixed quantum-classical model obtained via Ehrenfest's method. A second order (in time) method is introduced for each case. We show that the proposed methods allow time steps independent of the semi-classical parameter(s) while still capturing the correct behavior of physical observables. It also becomes clear that the order of accuracy of our methods can be improved in a straightforward way.

abstract: Charge noise is critical in the performance of gate-controlled quantum dots (QDs). Here we show the 1/f noise for a microscopic graphene QD is substantially larger than that for a macroscopic graphene field-effect transistor (FET), increasing linearly with temperature. To understand its origin, we suspended the graphene QD above the substrate. In contrast to large area graphene FETs, we find that a suspended graphene QD has an almost-identical noise level as an unsuspended one. Tracking noise levels around the Coulomb blockade peak as a function of gate voltage yields potential fluctuations of order 1 "{\mu}eV", almost one order larger than in GaAs/GaAlAs QDs. Edge states rather than substrate-induced disorders, appear to dominate the 1/f noise, thus affecting the coherency of graphene nano-devices.

The effect of spectral inhomogeneity is also considered, and a possible quantum eraser experiment is discussed for the case of identical dots.

abstract: The interaction between light and matter can give rise to novel topological states. This principle was recently exemplified in Floquet topological insulators, where \emph{classical} light was used to induce a topological electronic band structure. Here, in contrast, we show that mixing \emph{single} photons with excitons can result in new topological polaritonic states --- or "topolaritons". Taken separately, the underlying photons and excitons are topologically trivial. Combined appropriately, however, they give rise to non-trivial polaritonic bands with chiral edge modes allowing for unidirectional polariton propagation. The main ingredient in our construction is an exciton-photon coupling with a phase that winds in momentum space. We demonstrate how this winding emerges from spin-orbit coupling in the electronic system and an applied Zeeman field. We discuss the requirements for obtaining a sizable topological gap in the polariton spectrum, and propose practical ways to realize topolaritons in semiconductor quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

abstract: To consider the entanglement between the spatial region $A$ and its complement in a QFT, we need to assign a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_A$ to the region, by making a certain choice on the boundary $\partial A$. We argue that a small physical boundary is implicitly inserted at the entangling surface. We investigate these issues in the context of 2d CFTs, and show that we can indeed read off the Cardy states of the $c=1/2$ minimal model from the entanglement entropy of the critical Ising chain.

abstract: Quantum annealing is a heuristic quantum algorithm which exploits quantum resources to minimize an objective function embedded as the energy levels of a programmable physical system. To take advantage of a potential quantum advantage, one needs to be able to map the problem of interest to the native hardware with reasonably low overhead. Because experimental considerations constrain our objective function to take the form of a low degree PUBO (polynomial unconstrained binary optimization), we employ non-convex loss functions which are polynomial functions of the margin. We show that these loss functions are robust to label noise and provide a clear advantage over convex methods. These loss functions may also be useful for classical approaches as they compile to regularized risk expressions which can be evaluated in constant time with respect to the number of training examples.

Since XFEL is more powerful by several orders of magnitude than more conventional lasers, the systematic investigation of many of the standard assumptions and approximations has attracted increased attention. In this model the electrons move under a rapidly oscillating electromagnetic field, and the convergence of the problem to an effective time-averaged one is examined. We use an operator splitting pseudo-spectral method to investigate numerically the behaviour of the model versus its time-averaged version in complex situations, namely the energy subcritical/mass supercritical case, and in the presence of a periodic lattice. We find the time averaged model to be an effective approximation, even close to blowup, for fast enough oscillations of the external field. This work extends previous analytical results for simpler cases \cite{xfel1}.

abstract: Quantum electrodynamics in $1 + 1$ space-time dimensions is analytically solvable for massless fermions, while no solution is known for massive fermions. Employing the classical-statistical approach, we simulate the real-time dynamics on a lattice using Wilson fermions with mass $m$ at gauge coupling $g$. It is shown that quantitative properties of the massless Schwinger model are emerging in the limit of large $g/m$. We investigate two scenarios corresponding to opposite charges which are either held fixed or moving back-to-back along the light cone, as employed in effective descriptions for jet energy loss and photon production in the context of heavy-ion collisions. Remarkably, we find that the dynamics is rather well described by the massless limit for a wide range of mass values at fixed coupling. Moreover, our study shows that previous approximate scenarios with external charges on the light cone rather accurately capture the self-consistent dynamics of the energy conserving simulation.

abstract: Diradical molecules are essential species involved in many organic and inorganic chemical reactions. The computational study of their electronic structure is often challenging, because a reliable description of the correlation, and in particular of the static one, requires multi-reference techniques. The Jastrow correlated Antisymmetrized Geminal Power (JAGP) is a compact and efficient wave function ansatz, based on the valence-bond representation, which can be used within Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches. The AGP part can be rewritten in terms of molecular orbitals, obtaining a multi-determinant expansion with zero-seniority number. In the present work we demonstrate the capability of the JAGP ansatz to correctly describe the electronic structure of two diradical prototypes: the orthogonally twisted ethylene, C2H4, and the methylene, CH2, representing respectively a homosymmetric and heterosymmetric system. On the other hand, we show that the simple ansatz of a Jastrow correlated Single Determinant (JSD) wave function is unable to provide an accurate description of the electronic structure in these diradical molecules, both at variational level and, more remarkably, in the fixed-nodes projection schemes showing that a poor description of the static correlation yields an inaccurate nodal surface. The suitability of JAGP to correctly describe diradicals with a computational cost comparable with that of a JSD calculation, in combination with a favorable scalability of QMC algorithms with the system size, opens new perspectives in the ab initio study of large diradical systems, like the transition states in cycloaddition reactions and the thermal isomerization of biological chromophores.

It was written as a review for Plus Magazine, the online magazine of the UK's national mathematics education and outreach project, the Mathematics Millennium Project. Since some of the discussion (about symmetry breaking, and Pythagoreanism in the philosophy of mathematics) went beyond reviewing Tegmark's book, the material was divided into three online articles. This version combines those three articles, and adds some other material, in particular a brief defence of quidditism about properties. It also adds some references, to other Plus articles as well as academic articles. But it retains the informal style of Plus.

abstract: This paper gives a philosophical assessment of the Montevideo interpretation of quantum theory, advocated by Gambini, Pullin and co-authors. This interpretation has the merit of linking its proposal about how to solve the measurement problem to the search for quantum gravity: namely by suggesting that quantum gravity makes for fundamental limitations on the accuracy of clocks, which imply a type of decoherence that "collapses the wave-packet". I begin (Section 2) by sketching the topics of decoherence, and quantum clocks, on which the interpretation depends. Then I expound the interpretation, from a philosopher's perspective (Sections 3, 4 and 5). Finally, in Section 6, I argue that the interpretation, at least as developed so far, is best seen as a form of the Everett interpretation: namely with an effective or approximate branching, that is induced by environmental decoherence of the familiar kind, and by the Montevideans' "temporal decoherence".

abstract: In previous work, I described several examples combining reduction and emergence: where reduction is understood a la Ernest Nagel, and emergence is understood as behaviour or properties that are novel (by some salient standard). Here, my aim is again to reconcile reduction and emergence, for a case which is apparently more problematic than those I treated before: renormalization. Renormalization is a vast subject. So I confine myself to emphasizing how the modern approach to renormalization (initiated by Wilson and others between 1965 and 1975), when applied to quantum field theories, illustrates both Nagelian reduction and emergence. My main point is that the modern understanding of how renormalizability is a generic feature of quantum field theories at accessible energies gives us a conceptually unified family of Nagelian reductions. That is worth saying since philosophers tend to think of scientific explanation as only explaining an individual event, or perhaps a single law, or at most deducing one theory as a special case of another. Here we see a framework in which there is a space of theories endowed with enough structure that it provides a family of reductions.

abstract: Intense efforts have been made in recent years to realize nonlinear optical interactions at the single-photon level. Much of this work has focused on achieving strong third-order nonlinearities, such as by using single atoms or other quantum emitters while the possibility of achieving strong second-order nonlinearities remains unexplored. Here, we describe a novel technique to realize such nonlinearities using graphene, exploiting the strong per-photon fields associated with tightly confined graphene plasmons in combination with spatially nonlocal nonlinear optical interactions. We show that in properly designed graphene nanostructures, these conditions enable extremely strong internal down-conversion between a single quantized plasmon and an entangled plasmon pair, or the reverse process of second harmonic generation. A separate issue is how such strong internal nonlinearities can be observed, given the nominally weak coupling between these plasmon resonances and free-space radiative fields. On one hand, by using the collective coupling to radiation of nanostructure arrays, we show that the internal nonlinearities can manifest themselves as efficient frequency conversion of radiative fields at extremely low input powers. On the other hand, the development of techniques to efficiently couple to single nanostructures would allow these nonlinear processes to occur at the level of single input photons.

abstract: We demonstrate a waveplate for a pseudo-spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate using a two-photon Raman interaction. The angle of the waveplate is set by the relative phase of the optical fields, and the retardance is controlled by the pulse area. The waveplate allows us to image maps of the Stokes parameters of a Bose-Einstein condensate and thereby measure its relative ground state phase. We demonstrate the waveplate by measuring the Stokes parameters of a coreless vortex.

abstract: The emission cascade of a single quantum dot is a promising source of entangled photons. A prerequisite for this source is the use of a symmetric dot analogous to an atom in a vacuum, but the simultaneous achievement of structural symmetry and emission in a telecom band poses a challenge. Here we report the growth and characterization of highly symmetric InAs/InAlAs quantum dots self-assembled on C3v symmetric InP(111)A. The broad emission spectra cover the O (1.3 micron-m), C (1.55 micron-m), and L (1.6 micron-m) telecom bands. The distribution of the fine-structure splittings is considerably smaller than those reported in previous works on dots at similar wavelengths. The presence of dots with degenerate exciton lines is further confirmed by the optical orientation technique. Thus, our dot systems are expected to serve as efficient entangled photon emitters for long-distance fiber-based quantum key distribution.

We formulate a least mean squares estimation problem that involves a non-commutative system as the filter processing the non-commutative output signal. We solve this estimation problem within the framework of non-commutative probability. Also, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions which make these non-commutative estimators physically realizable.

abstract: The decomposition of electronic and nuclear motion presented in~[A. Abedi, N. T. Maitra, and E. K. U. Gross, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 123002 (2010)] yields a time-dependent potential that drives the nuclear motion and fully accounts for the coupling to the electronic subsystem. Here we show that propagation of an ensemble of independent classical nuclear trajectories on this exact potential yields dynamics that are essentially indistinguishable from the exact quantum dynamics for a model non-adiabatic charge transfer problem. We point out the importance of step and bump features in the exact potential that are critical in obtaining the correct splitting of the quasiclassical nuclear wave packet in space after it passes through an avoided crossing between two Born-Oppenheimer surfaces, and analyze their structure. Lastly, an analysis of the exact potentials in the context of trajectory surface hopping procedure is presented, including preliminary investigations of velocity-adjustment, and the force-induced decoherence effect.

abstract: Here we demonstrate, firstly, the construction of dualities using the exact renormalization group approach and, secondly, that spatial non-commutativity can emerge as such a duality. This is done in a simple quantum mechanical setting that establishes an exact duality between the commutative and non-commutative quantum Hall systems with harmonic interactions. It is also demonstrated that this link can be understood as a blocking (coarse graining) transformation in time that relates commutative and non-commutative degrees of freedom.

Then I turn to a much less controversial task: to expound the recent understanding of the time-energy uncertainty principle, and indeed of uncertainty principles in general, that has been established by such authors as Busch, Hilgevoord and Uffink. Although this may at first seem a narrow topic, I point out connections to other conceptual topics about time in quantum theory: for example, the question under what circumstances there is a time operator (Section 4.3).

This sub-Doppler cooling phase allows us to lower the initial temperature of 10$^9$ atoms from 500 to 40 $\mu$K in 2 ms. We observe that D$_1$ cooling remains effective into a high-intensity infrared dipole trap where two-state mixtures are evaporated to reach the degenerate regime. We produce molecular Bose-Einstein condensates of up to 5$\times$10$^{5}$ molecules and weakly-interacting degenerate Fermi gases of $7\times$10$^{5}$ atoms at $T/T_{F}<0.1$ with a typical experimental duty cycle of 11 seconds.

abstract: We consider a quantum system A U B made up of degrees of freedom that can be partitioned into spatially disjoint regions A and B. When the full system is in a pure state in which regions A and B are entangled, the quantum mechanics of region A described without reference to its complement is traditionally assumed to require a reduced density matrix on A. While this is certainly true as an exact matter, we argue that under many interesting circumstances expectation values of typical operators anywhere inside A can be computed from a suitable pure state on A alone, with a controlled error. We use insights from quantum statistical mechanics - specifically the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) - to argue for the existence of such "representative states".

abstract: The spin-magnetic moment of the proton $\mu_p$ is a fundamental property of this particle. So far $\mu_p$ has only been measured indirectly, analysing the spectrum of an atomic hydrogen maser in a magnetic field. Here, we report the direct high-precision measurement of the magnetic moment of a single proton using the double Penning-trap technique. We drive proton-spin quantum jumps by a magnetic radio-frequency field in a Penning trap with a homogeneous magnetic field. The induced spin-transitions are detected in a second trap with a strong superimposed magnetic inhomogeneity. This enables the measurement of the spin-flip probability as a function of the drive frequency. In each measurement the proton's cyclotron frequency is used to determine the magnetic field of the trap. From the normalized resonance curve, we extract the particle's magnetic moment in units of the nuclear magneton $\mu_p=2.792847350(9)\mu_N$. This measurement outperforms previous Penning trap measurements in terms of precision by a factor of about 760. It improves the precision of the forty year old indirect measurement, in which significant theoretical bound state corrections were required to obtain $\mu_p$, by a factor of 3. By application of this method to the antiproton magnetic moment $\mu_{\bar{p}}$ the fractional precision of the recently reported value can be improved by a factor of at least 1000. Combined with the present result, this will provide a stringent test of matter/antimatter symmetry with baryons.

abstract: The process of black hole evaporation resulting from the Hawking effect has generated an intense controversy regarding its potential conflict with quantum mechanics' unitary evolution. In a recent couple of works of a collaboration involving one of us, we have revised the controversy with the aims of, on the one hand, clarifying some conceptual issues surrounding it, and, at the same time, arguing that collapse theories have the potential to offer a satisfactory resolution of the so-called paradox. Here we show an explicit calculation supporting this claim using a simplified model of black hole creation and evaporation, known as the CGHS model, together with a dynamical reduction theory, known as CSL, and some speculative, but seemingly natural ideas about the role of quantum gravity in connection with the would-be singularity. This work represents a specific realization of general ideas first discussed in [1].

abstract: In this work we derive the general conditions for obtaining nonreciprocity in multi-mode parametrically-coupled systems. The results can be applied to a broad variety of optical, microwave, and hybrid systems including recent electro- and opto-mechanical devices. In deriving these results, we use a graph-based methodology to derive the scattering matrix. This approach naturally expresses the terms in the scattering coefficients as separate graphs corresponding to distinct coupling paths between modes such that it is evident that nonreciprocity arises as a consequence of multi-path interference and dissipation in key ancillary modes. These concepts facilitate the construction of new devices in which several other characteristics might also be simultaneously optimized. As an example, we synthesize a novel three-mode unilateral amplifier design by use of graphs. Finally, we analyze the isolation generated in a common parametric multi-mode system, the DC-SQUID.

abstract: We develop a systematic variational coherent state expansion for the many-body ground state of the spin-boson model, in which a quantum two-level system is coupled to a continuum of harmonic oscillators. Energetic constraints at the heart of this technique are rationalized in terms of polarons (displacements of the bath states in agreement with classical expectations) and antipolarons (counter-displacements due to quantum tunneling effects). We present a comprehensive study of the ground state two-level system population and coherence as a function of tunneling amplitude, dissipation strength, and bias (akin to asymmetry of the double well potential defining the two-state system). The entanglement among the different environmental modes is investigated by looking at spectroscopic signatures of the bipartite entanglement entropy between a given environmental mode and all the other modes. We observe a drastic change in behavior of this entropy for increasing dissipation, indicative of the entangled nature of the environmental states. In addition, the entropy spreads over a large energy range at strong dissipation, a testimony to the wide entanglement window characterizing the underlying Kondo state. Finally, comparisons to accurate numerical renormalization group calculations and to the exact Bethe Ansatz solution of the model demonstrate the rapid convergence of our variationally-optimized multi-polaron expansion, suggesting that it should also be a useful tool for dissipative models of greater complexity, as relevant for numerous systems of interest in quantum physics and chemistry.

abstract: We describe and characterize a device for alkali vapor pressure modulation on the 100ms timescale in a single-cell cold atom experiment. Its mechanism is based on optimized heat conduction between a current-modulated alkali dispenser and a heat sink at room temperature. We have studied both the short-term behavior during individual pulses and the long-term pressure evolution in the cell. The device combines fast trap loading and relatively long trap lifetime, enabling high repetition rates in a very simple setup. These features make it particularly suitable for portable atomic sensors.

abstract: In this work we present some new understanding of topological order, including three main aspects: (1) It was believed that classifying topological orders corresponds to classifying gapped quantum states. We show that such a statement is not precise. We introduce the concept of \emph{gapped quantum liquid} as a special kind of gapped quantum states that can "dissolve" any product states on additional sites. Topologically ordered states actually correspond to gapped quantum liquids with stable ground-state degeneracy. Symmetry-breaking states for on-site symmetry are also gapped quantum liquids, but with unstable ground-state degeneracy. (2) We point out that the universality classes of generalized local unitary (gLU) transformations (without any symmetry) contain both topologically ordered states and symmetry-breaking states. This allows us to use a gLU invariant -- topological entanglement entropy -- to probe the symmetry-breaking properties hidden in the exact ground state of a finite system, which does not break any symmetry. This method can probe symmetry- breaking orders even without knowing the symmetry and the associated order parameters. (3) The universality classes of topological orders and symmetry-breaking orders can be distinguished by \emph{stochastic local (SL) transformations} (i.e.\ \emph{local invertible transformations}): small SL transformations can convert the symmetry-breaking classes to the trivial class of product states with finite probability of success, while the topological-order classes are stable against any small SL transformations, demonstrating a phenomenon of emergence of unitarity. This allows us to give a new definition of long-range entanglement based on SL transformations, under which only topologically ordered states are long-range entangled.

abstract: We present a detailed derivation and numerical tests of a new mixed quantum-classical scheme to deal with non-adiabatic processes. The method is presented as the zero-th order approximation to the exact coupled dynamics of electrons and nuclei offered by the factorization of the electron-nuclear wave function [A. Abedi, N. T. Maitra and E. K. U. Gross, Phys. Rev. Lett., 105 (2010)]. Numerical results are presented for a model system for non-adiabatic charge transfer in order to test the performance of the method and to validate the underlying approximations.

abstract: Macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, related to an actively debated topic of the quantum-to-classical transition. In addition, implementation of quantum computing schemes, involving qubits, is often dependent on our ability to realize an MQT process, as well as on the protection of the resulting quantum state against decoherence. Decoherence in qubits can be reduced by means of topological protection, e.g., by exploiting various parity effects. In particular, the double-phase-slip effect can provide such protection for superconducting qubits. Here, we report direct observation of quantum double phase slips in thin-wire superconducting loops. We show that, in addition to conventional single phase slips, changing superconducting order parameter phase by $2\pi$, there are quantum transitions changing the phase by $4\pi$. Quantum double phase slips represent a synchronized occurrence of two macroscopic quantum tunneling events, i.e., the cotunneling. We demonstrate the existence of a striking regime in which double phase slips are exponentially more probable than single ones.

abstract: We experimentally and theoretically study the response of a superradiant or bad-cavity laser to an applied coherent drive. We observe two forms of synchronization (injection locking) between the superradiant ensemble and the applied drive: one attractive and one repulsive in nature. We explain the region of repulsion as arising from the higher three-dimensional description of the atomic spin state that stores the laser coherence in a superradiant laser, as opposed to a two-parameter description of the electric field in a traditional good-cavity laser. We derive a phase diagram of predicted behavior and experimentally measure the response of the system across various trajectories therein.

abstract: The probability operator for a generic non-equilibrium quantum system is derived. The corresponding stochastic, dissipative Schr\"odinger equation is also given. The dissipative and stochastic propagators are linked by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem that is derived from the unitary condition on the time propagator. The dissipative propagator is derived from thermodynamic force and entropy fluctuation operators that are in general non-linear.

abstract: In the present contribution, by studying a fractional version of Dirac's equation for the electron, we show that the phenomenon of Zitterbewegung in a coarse-grained medium exhibits a transient oscillatory behavior, rather than a purely oscillatory regime, as it occurs in the integer case, $\alpha=1$. Our result suggests that, in such systems, the Zitterbewegung-type term related to a trembling motion of a quasiparticle is tamed by its complex interactions with other particles and the medium. This can justify the difficulties in the observation of this interesting phenomenon. The possibility that the Zitterbewegung be accompanied by a damping factor supports the viewpoint of particle substructures in Quantum Mechanics.

abstract: We study the entanglement in a chain of harmonic oscillators driven out of equilibrium by preparing the two sides of the system at different temperatures, and subsequently joining them together. The steady state is constructed explicitly and the logarithmic negativity is calculated between two adjacent segments of the chain. We find that, for low temperatures, the steady-state entanglement is a sum of contributions pertaining to left- and right-moving excitations emitted from the two reservoirs. In turn, the steady-state entanglement is a simple average of the Gibbs-state values and thus its scaling can be obtained from conformal field theory. A similar averaging behaviour is observed during the entire time evolution. As a particular case, we also discuss a local quench where both sides of the chain are initialized in their respective ground states.

It is shown that the domain of stability for $(5Z,e)$ is $0 < Z \leq Z_{cr}^{(5Z,e)}=0.350$ with optimal geometrical configuration is given by dipyramid (equilateral triangle base) circumscribed in prolate spheroid. For $(6Z,e)$ the stability is $0 < Z \leq Z_{cr}^{(6Z,e)}=0.335$ with optimal geometrical configuration given by octahedron (square base) circumscribed in oblate spheroid. For both systems it is obtained an indication that total energy at $Z=Z_{cr}$ has a square-root branch point singularity with exponent $3/2$.

abstract: A generic and intuitive model for coherent energy transport in multiple minima systems coupled to a quantum mechanical bath is shown. Using a simple spin-boson system, we illustrate how a generic donor-acceptor system can be brought into resonance using a narrow band of vibrational modes, such that the transfer efficiency of an electron-hole pair (exciton) is made arbitrarily high. Coherent transport phenomena in nature are of renewed interest since the discovery that a photon captured by the light-harvesting complex (LHC) in photosynthetic organisms can be conveyed to a chemical reaction centre with near-perfect efficiency. Classical explanations of the transfer use stochastic diffusion to model the hopping motion of a photo-excited exciton. This accounts inadequately for the speed and efficiency of the energy transfer measured in a series of recent landmark experiments. Taking a quantum mechanical perspective can help capture the salient features of the efficient part of that transfer. To show the versatility of the model, we extend it to a multiple minima system comprising seven-sites, reminiscent of the widely studied Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex. We show that an idealised transport model for multiple minima coupled to a narrow-band phonon can transport energy with arbitrarily high efficiency.

abstract: We study, in the framework of open quantum systems, the time evolution of a circularly accelerated two-level atom coupled in the multipolar scheme to a bath of fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic fields. We find that both the spontaneous transition rates and the geometric phase for a circularly accelerated atom do not exhibit a clear sign of thermal radiation characterized by the Planckian factor in contrast to the linear acceleration case. The spontaneous transition rates and effective temperature of the atom are examined in detail in the ultrarelativistic limit and are shown to be always larger than those in the linear acceleration case with the same proper acceleration. Unlike the effective temperature, the geometric phase is dependent on the initial atomic states. We show that when the polar angle in Bloch sphere, $\theta$, that characterizes the initial state of the atom equals $\pi/{2}$, the geometric phases acquired due to circular and linear acceleration are the same. However, for a generic state with an arbitrary $\theta$, the phase will be in general different, and then we demonstrate in the ultrarelativistic limit that the geometric phase acquired for the atom in circular motion is always larger than that in linear acceleration with same proper acceleration for $\theta\in(0,\frac{\pi}{2})\cup(\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$.

abstract: The dissertation brings together approaches across the fields of physics, critical theory, literary studies, philosophy of physics, sociology of science, and history of science to synthesize a hybrid approach for instigating more rigorous and intense cross-disciplinary interrogations between the sciences and the humanities. There are two levels of conversations going on in the dissertation; at the first level, the discussion is centered on a critical historiography and philosophical implications of the discovery Higgs boson in relation to its position at the intersection of old (current) and the potential for new possibilities in quantum physics; I then position my findings on the Higgs boson in connection to the double-slit experiment that represents foundational inquiries into quantum physics, to demonstrate the bridge between fundamental physics and high energy particle physics. The conceptualization of the variants of the double-slit experiment informs the aforementioned critical comparisons. At the second level of the conversation, theories are produced from a close study of the physics objects as speculative engine for new knowledge generation that are then reconceptualized and re-articulated for extrapolation into the speculative ontology of hard science fiction, particularly the hard science fiction written with the double intent of speaking to the science while producing imaginative and socially conscious science through the literary affordances of science fiction. The works of science fiction examined here demonstrate the tension between the internal values of physics in the practice of theory and experiment and questions on ethics, culture, and morality.

abstract: Hilary Putnam (1965, 2005) has argued that from a realist perspective, quantum mechanics stands in need of an interpretation. Ironically, this hypothesis may appear vulnerable against arguments drawing on Putnam's own work. Nancy Cartwright (2005) has urged that his 1962 essay on the meaning of theoretical terms suggests that quantum mechanics needs no interpretation and thus stands in tension with his claim of three years later. She furthermore contends that this conflict should be resolved in favour of the earlier work, as quantum mechanics, like all successful theories, does not need an interpretation. The first part of this essay deflates both of these objections. The second part addresses and evaluates Putnam's own assessments of the main interpretative options available in 1965 and 2005. Although we may disagree on some aspects, his pessimistic conclusion will come out largely unscathed, and, in fact, enhanced. I will close by briefly stating the historical relevance of this work.

abstract: A brief perspective on light scattering in dense and cold atomic rubidium is presented. We particularly focus on the influence of auxiliary applied fields on the system response to a weak and nearly resonant probe field. Auxiliary fields can strongly disturb light propagation; in addition to the steady state case, dynamically interesting effects appear clearly in both the time domain, and in the optical polarization dependence of the processes. Following a general introduction, two examples of features found in such studies are presented. These include nonlinear optical effects in (a) comparative studies of forward- and fluorescence-configuration scattering under combined excitation of a control and probe field, and (b) manipulation of the spatial structure of the optical response due to a light shifting strong applied field.

abstract: Spin models are used in virtually every study of complex systems---be it condensed matter physics [1-4], neural networks [5] or economics [6,7]---as they exhibit very rich macroscopic behaviour despite their microscopic simplicity. It has long been known that by coarse-graining the system, the low energy physics of the models can be classified into different universality classes [8]. Here we establish a counterpart to this phenomenon: by "fine-graining" the system, we prove that all the physics of every classical spin model is exactly reproduced in the low energy sector of certain `universal models'. This means that (i) the low energy spectrum of the universal model is identical to the entire spectrum of the original model, (ii) the corresponding spin configurations are exactly reproduced, and (iii) the partition function is approximated to any desired precision. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for a spin model to be universal, which show that complexity in the ground state alone is sufficient to reproduce full energy spectra. We use this to show that one of the simplest and most widely studied models, the 2D Ising model with fields, is universal.

abstract: The Hamiltonian for a PT-symmetric chain of coupled oscillators is constructed. It is shown that if the loss-gain parameter $\gamma$ is uniform for all oscillators, then as the number of oscillators increases, the region of unbroken PT-symmetry disappears entirely. However, if $\gamma$ is localized in the sense that it decreases for more distant oscillators, then the unbroken-PT-symmetric region persists even as the number of oscillators approaches infinity. In the continuum limit the oscillator system is described by a PT-symmetric pair of wave equations, and a localized loss-gain impurity leads to a pseudo-bound state. It is also shown that a planar configuration of coupled oscillators can have multiple disconnected regions of unbroken PT symmetry.

abstract: Are topological solitons elementary or composites? We answer this question by drawing up a corpuscular formalism in which solitons are coherent states of quantum constituents. This naturally leads to a functional integral representation, in which the classical saddle point is reached as the most probable distribution of corpuscles in the $\hbar = 0$ limit and where quantum corpuscular corrections correspond to excursions away from such a distribution that occur only for finite $\hbar$. Several striking features come up. Topological charge emerges as a collective flow of quantum numbers carried by individual corpuscles. Moreover, the corpuscular corrections are not reducible to any known form of quantum corrections, such as loop expansions in the coupling constant $\hbar g^2$ or semiclassical $e^{-1/\hbar g^2}$ effects. Corpuscular corrections are stronger and appear already at order $\sqrt{\hbar g^2}$. In SUSY theories quantum corpuscular corrections generically break supersymmetry. We show that a domain wall which perturbatively is a BPS state, violates all supersymmetries when the corpuscular effects are taken into account. The extension of the corpuscular structure to $D$-branes can lead to a built-in supersymmetry breaking mechanism in string theory, insensitive to technicalities such as moduli stabilization, with the SUSY breaking scale set by the string coupling times the $D$-brane tension.

abstract: We investigate the decoherence patterns of topological qubits in contact with the environment by a novel way of deriving the open system dynamics other than the Feynman-Vernon. Each topological qubit is made of two Majorana modes of a 1D Kitaev's chain. These two Majorana modes interact with the environment in an incoherent way which yields peculiar decoherence patterns of the topological qubit. More specifically, we consider the open system dynamics of the topological qubits which are weakly coupled to the fermionic/bosonic Ohmic-like environments. We find atypical patterns of quantum decoherence. In contrast to the cases of non-topological qubits for which they always decohere completely in all Ohmic-like environments, the topological qubits decohere completely in the Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments but not in the super-Ohmic ones. Moreover, we find that the fermion parities of the topological qubits though cannot prevent the qubit states from decoherence in the sub-Ohmic environments, can prevent from thermalization turning into Gibbs state. We also study the cases in which each Majorana mode can couple to different Ohmic-like environments and the time dependence of concurrence for two topological qubits.

abstract: The spin-resolved non-equilibrium real-time electron transport through a double-quantum-dot (DQD) Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer with spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is explored. The SOI and AB interference in the real-time dynamics of spin transport is expressed by effective magnetic fluxes. Analytical formulae for the time-dependent currents, for initially unpolarized spins, are presented. In many cases, there appear spin currents in the electrodes, for which the spins in each electrode are polarized along characteristic directions, pre-determined by the SOI parameters and by the geometry of the system. Special choices of the system parameters yield steady-state currents in which the spins are fully polarized along these characteristic directions. The time required to reach this steady state depends on the couplings of the DQD to the leads. The magnitudes of the currents depend strongly on the SOI-induced effective fluxes. Without the magnetic flux, the spin-polarized current cannot be sustained to the steady states, due to the phase rigidity for this system. For a non-degenerate DQD, transient spin transport can be produced by the sole effects of SOI. We also show that one can extract the spin-resolved currents from measurements of the total charge current.

The question what an interpretation of QM is has hardly ever been raised explicitly, let alone answered. We raise it and answer it. Then the quest for the right interpretation can continue self-consciously, for we then know exactly what we are after. We present a list of minimal requirements that something has to meet in order to qualify as an interpretation of QM. We also raise, as a side issue, the question how the discourse on the interpretation of QM relates to hermeneutics in Continental Philosophy.

abstract: Quantization of electromagnetic fields is investigated in the framework of stochastic variational method (SVM). Differently from the canonical quantization, this method does not require canonical form and quantization can be performed directly from the gauge invariant Lagrangian. The gauge condition is used to choose dynamically independent variables. We verify that, in the Coulomb gauge condition, SVM result is completely equivalent to the traditional result. On the other hand, in the Lorentz gauge condition, SVM quantization can be performed without introducing the indefinite metric. The temporal and longitudinal components of the gauge filed, then, behave as c-number functionals affected by quantum fluctuation through the interaction with charged matter fields. To see further the relation between SVM and the canonical quantization, we quantize the usual gauge Lagrangian with the Fermi term and argue a stochastic process with a negative second order correlation is introduced to reproduce the indefinite metric.

abstract: We present a microscopic theory for the current through a tunnel Josephson junction coupled to a non-linear environment, which consists of an Andreev two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator. It models a recent experiment [Bretheau, Girit, Pothier, Esteve, and Urbina, Nature (London) 499, 312 (2013)] on photon spectroscopy of Andreev bound states in a superconducting atomic-size contact. We find the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the environment and derive the current through the junction due to inelastic Cooper pair tunneling. The current-voltage characteristic reveals the transitions between the Andreev bound states, the excitation of the harmonic mode that hybridizes with the Andreev bound states, as well as multi-photon processes. The calculated spectra are in fair agreement with the experimental data.

abstract: Surface Tamm states arise in one-dimensional lattices from some defects at the lattice edge and their energy generally falls in a gap of the crystal. The defects at the surface change rather generally the phase of propagative Bloch waves scattered off at the lattice edge, so that an observer, far from the surface, can detect the existence of edge defects from e.g. time-of-flight measurements as a delay or an advancement of a Bloch wave packet. Here we show that a special class of defects can sustain surface Tamm states which are invisible, in a sense that reflected waves acquire the same phase as in a fully homogeneous lattice with no surface state. Surface states have an energy embedded into the tight-binding lattice band and show a lower than exponential (algebraic) localization. Like most of bound states in the continuum of von Neumann - Wigner type, such states are fragile and decay into resonance surface states in presence of perturbations or lattice disorder. The impact of structural lattice imperfections and disorder on the invisibility of the defects is investigated by numerical simulations.

abstract: We construct a complete set of Wannier functions which are localized at both given positions and momenta. This allows us to introduce the quantum phase space, onto which a quantum pure state can be mapped unitarily. Using its probability distribution in quantum phase space, we define an entropy for a quantum pure state. We prove an inequality regarding the long time behavior of our entropy's fluctuation. For a typical initial state, this inequality indicates that our entropy can relax dynamically to a maximized value and stay there most of time with small fluctuations. This result echoes the quantum H-theorem proved by von Neumann in [Zeitschrift f\"ur Physik {\bf 57}, 30 (1929)]. Our entropy is different from the standard von Neumann entropy, which is always zero for quantum pure states. According to our definition, a system always has bigger entropy than its subsystem even when the system is described by a pure state. As the construction of the Wannier basis can be implemented numerically, the dynamical evolution of our entropy is illustrated with an example.

abstract: Organic solar cells must separate strongly bound electron-hole pairs into free charges. This is achieved at interfaces between electron donor and acceptor organic semiconductors. The most popular electron acceptor is the fullerene derivative PCBM. Electron-hole separation has been observed on femtosecond timescales, which is incompatible with conventional Marcus theories of organic transport. In this work we show that ultrafast charge transport in PCBM arises from its broad range of electronic eigenstates, provided by the presence of three closely spaced delocalised bands near the LUMO level. Vibrational fluctuations enable rapid transitions between these bands, which drives an electron transport of $\sim$3 nm within 100 fs. All this is demonstrated within a realistic tight binding Hamiltonian containing transfer integrals no larger than 8 meV.

abstract: We explore the electronic structure and rovibrational properties of an ultralong-range triatomic Rydberg molecule formed by a Rydberg atom and a ground state heteronuclear diatomic molecule. We focus here on interaction of Rb($27s$) Rydberg atom with KRb($N=0$) diatomic polar molecule. There's significant electronic hybridization of Rb($n=24$, $l\ge 3$) degenerate manifold. The polar diatomic molecule is allowed to rotate in the electric fields generated by the Rydberg electron and core as well as an external field. We investigate the metamorphosis of the Born-Oppenheimer potential curves, essential for the binding of the molecule, with varying electric field and analyze the resulting properties such as the vibrational structure and the alignment and orientation of the polar diatomic molecule.

abstract: We analyze the renormalization group (RG) flow of the temperature independent term of the entropy in the high temperature limit \beta/a<<1 of a massive field theory in 3-dimensional spherical spaces M_3 with constant curvature 6/a^2. For masses lower than 2\pi/\beta, this term can be identified with the free energy of the same theory on M_3 considered as a 3-dimensional Euclidean space-time. The non-extensive part of this free energy, S_hol, is generated by the holonomy of the spatial metric connection. We show that for homogeneous spherical spaces the holonomy entropy S_hol decreases monotonically when the RG scale flows to the infrared. At the conformal fixed points the values of the holonomy entropy do coincide with the genuine topological entropies recently introduced. The monotonic behavior of the RG flow leads to an inequality between the topological entropies of the conformal field theories connected by such flow, i.e. S_top^UV > S_top^IR. From a 3-dimensional viewpoint the same term arises in the 3-dimensional Euclidean effective action and has the same monotonic behavior under the RG group flow. We conjecture that such monotonic behavior is generic, which would give rise to a 3-dimensional generalization of the c-theorem, along the lines of the 2-dimensional c-theorem and the 4-dimensional a-theorem. The conjecture is related to recent formulations of the F-theorem. In particular, the holonomy entropy on lens spaces is directly related to the topological R\'enyi entanglement entropy on disks of 2-dimensional flat spaces.

abstract: We report on the first direct observation of fast spin-exchange coherent oscillations between different long-lived electronic orbitals of ultracold $^{173}$Yb fermions. We measure, in a model-independent way, the strength of the exchange interaction driving this coherent process. This observation allows us to retrieve important information on the inter-orbital collisional properties of $^{173}$Yb atoms and paves the way to novel quantum simulations of paradigmatic models of two-orbital quantum magnetism.

abstract: We show that an analog of the physics at the Planck scale can be found in the propagation of tightly focused laser beams. Various equations that occur in generalized quantum mechanics are formally identical to those describing the nonlinear nonlocal propagation of nonparaxial laser beams. The analysis includes a generalized uncertainty principle and shows that the nonlinear focusing of a light beam with dimensions comparable to the wavelength corresponds to the spontaneous excitation of the so-called maximally localized states. The approach, driven by the ideas of the quantum gravity physics, allows one to predict the existence of self-trapped subwavelength solitary waves for both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities, and opens the way to laboratory simulations of phenomena that have been considered to be inaccessible.

abstract: An algorithm to compute Connes spectral distance, adaptable to the Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation of non-commutative quantum mechanics, was developed earlier by introducing the appropriate spectral triple and used to compute infinitesimal distances in the Moyal plane, revealing a deep connection between geometry and statistics. In this paper, using the same algorithm, the Connes spectral distance has been calculated in the Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation for the fuzzy sphere whose spatial coordinates satisfy the $su(2)$ algebra. This has been computed for both the discrete, as well as for the Perelemov's $SU(2)$ coherent state. Here also, we get a connection between geometry and statistics which is shown by computing the infinitesimal distance between mixed states on the quantum Hilbert space of a particular fuzzy sphere, indexed by $n\in\mathbb{Z}/2$.

abstract: Realization of robust coherent quantum phase slips represents a significant experimental challenge. Here we propose a novel structure that utilizes multiple nanowire junctions to enhance the process of quantum phase slips in a phase-slip flux qubit. In this structure, each superconducting island separated by two adjoining junctions is biased by a gate voltage, which allows us to have a tunable phase-slip rate. Furthermore, we describe how to couple two phase-slip flux qubits via the mutual inductance between them. These two inductively coupled phase-slip flux qubits are dual to two capacitively coupled charge qubits.

abstract: We introduce a spin-orbital entangled (SOE) resonating valence bond (RVB) state on a square lattice of spins-$\frac12$ and orbitals represented by pseudospins-$\frac12$. Like the standard RVB state, it is a superposition of nearest-neighbor hard-core coverings of the lattice by spin singlets, but adjacent singlets are favoured to have perpendicular orientations and, more importantly, an orientation of each singlet is entangled with orbitals' state on its two lattice sites. The SOE-RVB state can be represented by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) with a bond dimension $D=4$. This representation helps to reveal that the state is a superposition of striped coverings conserving a topological quantum number. The stripes are a critical quantum spin liquid. We propose a spin-orbital Hamiltonian supporting a SOE-RVB ground state.

abstract: We highlight a dynamical anomaly in which the rate of relaxation towards thermal equilibrium in a bi-partite quantum system violates the standard linear-response (Kubo) formulation, even when the underlying dynamics is highly chaotic. This anomaly originates from an $\hbar$-dependent sparsity of the underlying quantum network of transitions. Using a minimal bi-partite Bose-Hubbard model as an example, we find that the relaxation rate acquires an anomalous $\hbar$ dependence that reflects percolation-like dynamics in energy space.

abstract: We explore entanglement negativity, a measure of the distillable entanglement contained in a quantum state, in relativistic field theories in various dimensions. We first give a general overview of negativity and its properties and then explain a well known result relating (logarithmic) negativity of pure quantum states to the Renyi entropy (at index $1/2$), by exploiting the simple features of entanglement in thermal states. In particular, we show that the negativity of the thermofield double state is given by the free energy difference of the system at temperature $T$ and $2\,T$ respectively. We then use this result to compute the negativity in the vacuum state of conformal field theories in various dimensions, utilizing results that have been derived for free and holographic CFTs in the literature. We also comment upon general lessons to be learnt about negativity in holographic field theories.

abstract: Low-rank tensor approximation techniques attempt to mitigate the overwhelming complexity of linear algebra tasks arising from high-dimensional applications. In this work, we study the low-rank approximability of solutions to linear systems and eigenvalue problems on Hilbert spaces. Although this question is central to the success of all existing solvers based on low-rank tensor techniques, very few of the results available so far allow to draw meaningful conclusions for higher dimensions. In this work, we develop a constructive framework to study low-rank approximability. One major assumption is that the involved linear operator admits a low-rank representation with respect to the chosen tensor format, a property that is known to hold in a number of applications. Simple conditions, which are shown to hold for a fairly general problem class, guarantee that our derived low-rank truncation error estimates do not deteriorate as the dimensionality increases.

abstract: Despite tremendous advances in the fundamentals and applications of cavity quantum electrodynamics with single InAs/GaAs quantum dots, investigations in this field have been limited to optical cavities composed of purely dielectric materials. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the coupling of an InAs/GaAs quantum dot to a hybrid metal/semiconductor nanocavity consisting of a GaAs nanocylinder embedded in a metallic film. Key features of our nanometallic light-matter interface include: (i) order of magnitude reduction in mode volume compared to that of leading photonic crystal CQED systems, resulting in a maximum atom-field coupling rate of g/(2{\pi}) ~180 GHz for InAs/GaAs quantum dots; (ii) surface-emitting nanocylinder geometry and therefore good collection efficiency compared to the bulk (~5X enhancement); and finally (iii) strong and broadband spontaneous emission rate enhancement (Purcell factor ~8). This light-matter interface may play an important role in the fundamentals of cavity quantum electrodynamics as well as in its application to optical interconnects and quantum networks.

abstract: Benford's Law is an empirical law which predicts the frequency of significant digits in databases corresponding to various phenomena, natural or artificial. Although counter intuitive at the first sight, it predicts a higher occurrence of digit 1, and decreasing occurrences to other larger digits. Here we report the Benford analysis of various NMR databases and draw several interesting inferences. We observe that, in general, NMR signals follow Benford distribution in time-domain as well as in frequency domain. Our survey included NMR signals of various nuclear species in a wide variety of molecules in different phases, namely liquid, liquid-crystalline, and solid. We also studied the dependence of Benford distribution on NMR parameters such as signal to noise ratio, number of scans, pulse angles, and apodization. In this process we also find that, under certain circumstances, the Benford analysis can distinguish a genuine spectrum from a visually identical simulated spectrum. Further we find that chemical-shift databases and amplitudes of certain radio frequency pulses generated using optimal control techniques also satisfy Benford's law to a good extent.

abstract: We demonstrate the development of a double quantum dot with an integrated charge sensor fabricated in undoped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures using a double top-gated design. Based on the evaluation of the integrated charge sensor, the double quantum dot can be tuned to a few-electron region. Additionally, the inter-dot coupling of the double quantum dot can be tuned to a large extent according to the voltage on the middle gate. The quantum dot is shown to be tunable from a single dot to a well-isolated double dot. To assess the stability of such design, the potential fluctuation induced by 1/f noise was measured. Based on the findings herein, the quantum dot design developed in the undoped GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor shows potential for the future exploitation of nano-devices.

abstract: Under an appropriate symmetric extensive bipartition in a one-dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, a bulk critical entanglement spectrum can be obtained, resembling the excitation spectrum of the critical point separating the SPT phase from the trivial (vacuum) state. Such a critical point is beyond the standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm for symmetry breaking phase transitions. For the $S=1$ SPT (Haldane) phase with the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki exact wave function, the resulting critical entanglement spectrum has a residual entropy per lattice site $s_{r}=0.67602$, showing a delocalized version of the edge excitations in the SPT phase. From the wave function corresponding to the lowest entanglement energy level, the central charge of the critical point can be extracted $c\approx 1.01\pm 0.01$. The critical theory can be identified as the same effective field theory as the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain or the spin-1/2 Haldane-Shastry model with inverse square long-range interaction.

Due to quantum noise strict frequency locking is absent and is replaced by a crossover from weak to strong frequency entrainment. We discuss the differences to the behavior of one quantum Van der Pol oscillator subject to an external drive. Moreover, we describe a possible experimental realization of two coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators in an optomechanical setting.

abstract: We extend coupled-cluster theory performed on top of a Slater determinant breaking rotational symmetry to allow for the exact restoration of the angular momentum at any truncation order. The main objective relates to the description of near-degenerate finite quantum systems with an open-shell character. As such, the newly developed many-body formalism offers a wealth of potential applications and further extensions dedicated to the ab initio description of, e.g., doubly open-shell atomic nuclei and molecule dissociation. The formalism, which encompasses both single-reference coupled cluster theory and projected Hartree-Fock theory as particular cases, permits the computation of usual sets of connected diagrams while consistently incorporating static correlations through the highly non-perturbative restoration of rotational symmetry. Interestingly, the yrast spectroscopy of the system, i.e. the lowest energy associated with each angular momentum, is accessed within a single calculation. A key difficulty presently overcome relates to the necessity to handle generalized energy {\it and} norm kernels for which naturally terminating coupled-cluster expansions could be eventually obtained. The present work focuses on $SU(2)$ but can be extended to any (locally) compact Lie group and to discrete groups, such as most point groups. In particular, the formalism will be soon generalized to $U(1)$ symmetry associated with particle number conservation. This is relevant to Bogoliubov coupled cluster theory that was recently formulated and applied to singly open-shell nuclei.

abstract: We study the high-dimensional entanglement of a photon pair transmitted through a random medium. We show that multiple scattering in combination with the subsequent selection of only a fraction of outgoing modes reduces the average entanglement of an initially maximally entangled two-photon state. Entanglement corresponding to a random pure state is obtained when the number of modes accessible in transmission is much less than the number of modes in the incident light. An amount of entanglement approaching that of the incident light can be recovered by accessing a larger number of transmitted modes. In contrast, a pair of photons in a separable state does not gain any entanglement when transmitted through a random medium.

The characteristics of a single emitter, a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) center in diamond, are measured before and after producing the SIL and compared with each other. A count rate of 1.0 million counts per second is achieved with a $[111]$ oriented NV center.

abstract: The elimination of defects from SiC has facilitated its move to the forefront of the optoelectronics and power-electronics industries. Nonetheless, because the electronic states of SiC defects can have sharp optical and spin transitions, they are increasingly recognized as a valuable resource for quantum-information and nanoscale-sensing applications. Here, we show that individual electron spin states in highly purified monocrystalline 4H-SiC can be isolated and coherently controlled. Bound to neutral divacancy defects, these states exhibit exceptionally long ensemble Hahn-echo spin coherence, exceeding 1 ms. Coherent control of single spins in a material amenable to advanced growth and microfabrication techniques is an exciting route to wafer-scale quantum technologies.

abstract: We present experiments on the dynamics of a two-state parametric fluctuator in a superconducting flux qubit. In spectroscopic measurements, the fluctuator manifests itself as a doublet line. When the qubit is excited in resonance with one of the two doublet lines, the correlation of readout results exhibits an exponential time decay which provides a measure of the fluctuator transition rate. The rate increases with temperature in the interval 40 to 158 mK. Based on the magnitude of the transition rate and the doublet line splitting we conclude that the fluctuation is induced by quasiparticle tunneling. These results demonstrate the importance of considering quasiparticles as a source of decoherence in flux qubits.

abstract: Ground-state cooling of mesoscopic mechanical resonators is a fundamental requirement for test of quantum theory and for implementation of quantum information. We analyze the cavity optomechanical cooling limits in the intermediate coupling regime, where the light-enhanced optomechanical coupling strength is comparable with the cavity decay rate. It is found that in this regime the cooling breaks through the limits in both the strong and weak coupling regimes. The lowest cooling limit is derived analytically at the optimal conditions of cavity decay rate and coupling strength. In essence, cooling to the quantum ground state requires $Q_{\mathrm{m}}>2.4n_{\mathrm{th}% }$, with $Q_{\mathrm{m}}$ being the mechanical quality factor and $n_{\mathrm{th}}$ being the thermal phonon number. Remarkably, ground-state cooling is achievable starting from room temperature, when mechanical $Q$-frequency product $Q_{\mathrm{m}}{\nu>1.5}\times10^{13}$, and both of the cavity decay rate and the coupling strength exceed the thermal decoherence rate. Our study provides a general framework for optimizing the backaction cooling of mesoscopic mechanical resonators.

abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with random $\pm1$ couplings is programmed on the D-Wave Two annealer featuring 509 qubits interacting on a Chimera-type graph. The performance of the optimizer compares and correlates to simulated annealing. When considering the effect of the static noise, which degrades the performance of the annealer, one can estimate an improvement on the comparative scaling of the two methods in favor of the D-Wave machine. The optimal choice of parameters of the embedding on the Chimera graph is shown to be associated to the emergence of the spin-glass critical temperature of the embedded problem.

abstract: We analyze bound states of Robin Laplacian in infinite planar domains with a smooth boundary, in particular, their relations to the geometry of the latter. The domains considered have locally straight boundary being, for instance, locally deformed halfplanes or wedges, or infinite strips, alternatively they are the exterior of a bounded obstacle. In the situation when the Robin condition is strongly attractive, we derive a two-term asymptotic formula in which the next-to-leading term is determined by the extremum of the boundary curvature. We also discuss the non-asymptotic case of attractive boundary interaction and show that the discrete spectrum is nonempty if the domain is a local deformation of a halfplane or a wedge of angle less than $\pi$, and it is void if the domain is concave.

abstract: Periodically driven systems can lead to a directed motion of particles. We investigate this ratchet effect for a bosonic Mott insulator where both a staggered hopping and a staggered local potential vary periodically in time. If driving frequencies are smaller than the interaction strength and the density of excitations is small, one obtains effectively a one-particle quantum ratchet describing the motion of doubly occupied sites (doublons) and empty sites (holes). Such a simple quantum machine can be used to manipulate the excitations of the Mott insulator. For suitably chosen parameters, for example, holes and doublons move in opposite direction. To investigate whether the periodic driving can be used to move particles "uphill", i.e., against an external force, we study the influence of a linear potential $- g x$. For long times, transport is only possible when the driving frequency $\omega$ and the external force $g$ are commensurate, $n_0 g = m_0 \omega$, with $\frac{n_0}{2},m_0 \in \mathbb{Z}$.

abstract: We present a detailed study of the fidelity, the entanglement entropy, and the entanglement spectrum, for a dimerized chain of spinless fermions---a simplified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model---with open boundary conditions which is a well-known example for a model supporting a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. In the non-interacting case the Hamiltonian matrix is tridiagonal and the eigenvalues and -vectors can be given explicitly as a function of a single parameter which is known analytically for odd chain lengths and can be determined numerically in the even length case. From a scaling analysis of these data for essentially semi-infinite chains we obtain the fidelity susceptibility and show that it contains a boundary contribution which is different in the topologically ordered than in the topologically trivial phase. For the entanglement spectrum and entropy we confirm predictions from massive field theory for a block in the middle of an infinite chain but also consider blocks containing the edge of the chain. For the latter case we show that in the SPT phase additional entanglement---as compared to the trivial phase---is present which is localized at the boundary. Finally, we extend our study to the dimerized chain with a nearest-neighbour interaction using exact diagonalization, Arnoldi, and density-matrix renormalization group methods and show that a phase transition into a topologically trivial charge-density wave phase occurs.

abstract: The Haldane model on the honeycomb lattice is a paradigmatic example of a Hamiltonian featuring topologically distinct phases of matter. It describes a mechanism through which a quantum Hall effect can appear as an intrinsic property of a band-structure, rather than being caused by an external magnetic field. Although an implementation in a material was considered unlikely, it has provided the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research exploring topological insulators and superconductors. Here we report on the experimental realisation of the Haldane model and the characterisation of its topological band-structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically modulated optical honeycomb lattice. The model is based on breaking time-reversal symmetry as well as inversion symmetry. The former is achieved through the introduction of complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms, which we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position. For the latter, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites. Breaking either of these symmetries opens a gap in the band-structure, which is probed using momentum-resolved interband transitions. We explore the resulting Berry-curvatures of the lowest band by applying a constant force to the atoms and find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between both broken symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically distinct regimes. By identifying the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we map out this transition line experimentally and compare it to calculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our approach, which allows for dynamically tuning topological properties, is suitable even for interacting fermionic systems. Furthermore, we propose a direct extension to realise spin-dependent topological Hamiltonians.

abstract: We present the realization of a compact micro-wave frequency synthesizer for an atom interferometer based on stimulated Raman transitions, applied to transportable inertial sensing. Our set-up is intended to address the hyperfine transitions of Rubidium 87 atoms at 6.8 GHz. The prototype is evaluated both in the time and the frequency domain by comparison with state-of-the-art frequency references developed at LNE-SYRTE. In free-running mode, it features a residual phase noise level of -65 dBrad$^2.Hz^{-1} at 10-Hz offset frequency and a white phase noise level in the order of -120 dBrad^2.Hz^{-1} for Fourier frequencies above 10 kHz. The phase noise effect on the sensitivity of the atomic interferometer is evaluated for diverse values of cycling time, interrogation time and Raman pulse duration. To our knowledge, the resulting contribution is well below the sensitivity of any demonstrated cold atom inertial sensors based on stimulated Raman transitions. The drastic improvement in terms of size, simplicity and power consumption paves the way towards field and mobile operations.
