abstract: We examine stochastic maps in the context of quantum optics. Making use of the master equation, the damping basis, and the Bloch picture we calculate a non-unital, completely positive, trace-preserving map with unequal damping eigenvalues. This results in what we call the squeezed vacuum channel. A geometrical picture of the effect of stochastic noise on the set of pure state qubit density operators is provided. Finally, we study the capacity of the squeezed vacuum channel to transmit quantum information and to distribute EPR states.

title: An Arbitrary Two-qubit Computation In 23 Elementary Gates
authors: Stephen S. Bullock, Igor L. Markov
comments: 18 pages, 7 figures. Version 2 gives correct credits for the GQC "quantum compiler". Version 3 adds justification for our choice of elementary gates and adds a comparison with classical library-less logic synthesis. It adds acknowledgements and a new reference, adds full details about the 8-gate decomposition of topC-V and stealthily fixes several minor inaccuracies. NOTE: Using a new technique, we recently improved the lower bound to 18 gates and (tada!) found a circuit decomposition that requires 18 gates or less. This work will appear as a separate manuscript

abstract: Quantum circuits currently constitute a dominant model for quantum computation. Our work addresses the problem of constructing quantum circuits to implement an arbitrary given quantum computation, in the special case of two qubits. We pursue circuits without ancilla qubits and as small a number of elementary quantum gates as possible. Our lower bound for worst-case optimal two-qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates: 15 one-qubit rotations and 2 CNOTs. To this end, we constructively prove a worst-case upper bound of 23 elementary gates, of which at most 4 (CNOT) entail multi-qubit interactions. Our analysis shows that synthesis algorithms suggested in previous work, although more general, entail much larger quantum circuits than ours in the special case of two qubits. One such algorithm has a worst case of 61 gates of which 18 may be CNOTs. Our techniques rely on the KAK decomposition from Lie theory as well as the polar and spectral (symmetric Shur) matrix decompositions from numerical analysis and operator theory. They are related to the canonical decomposition of a two-qubit gate with respect to the ``magic basis'' of phase-shifted Bell states, published previously. We further extend this decomposition in terms of elementary gates for quantum computation.

abstract: We show that multidimensional Zeno effect combined with non-holonomic control allows to efficiently protect quantum systems from decoherence by a method similar to classical coding. Contrary to the conventional approach, our method is applicable to arbitrary error-inducing Hamiltonians and general quantum systems. We also propose algorithms of finding encoding that approaches the Hamming upper bound along with methods of practical realizations of the encodings. Two new codes protecting 2 information qubits out of 7 and 4 information qubits out of 9 against a single error with arbitrarily small probability of failure are constructed as an example.

Standard properties of such states are recovered as certain limiting cases. The new formalism leads to field operators and not operator-valued distributions. The example of radiation fields produced by a classical current shows an automatic regularization of the infrared divergence.

abstract: Imagine that Alice and Bob, unable to communicate, are both given a 16-bit string such that the strings are either equal, or they differ in exactly 8 positions. Both parties are then supposed to output a 4-bit string in such a way that these short strings are equal if and only if the original longer strings given to them were equal as well. It is known that this task can be fulfilled without failure and without communication if Alice and Bob share 4 maximally entangled quantum bits. We show that, on the other hand, they CANNOT win the same game with certainty if they only share classical bits, even if it is an unlimited number. This means that for fulfilling this particular distributed task, quantum entanglement can completely replace communication. This phenomenon has been called pseudo-telepathy. The results of this paper complete the analysis of the first proposed game of this type between two players.

abstract: Single Cesium atoms are cooled and trapped inside a small optical cavity by way of a novel far-off-resonance dipole-force trap (FORT), with observed lifetimes of 2 to 3 seconds. Trapped atoms are observed continuously via transmission of a strongly coupled probe beam, with individual events lasting ~ 1 s. The loss of successive atoms from the trap N = 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 is thereby monitored in real time. Trapping, cooling, and interactions with strong coupling are enabled by the FORT potential, for which the center-of-mass motion is only weakly dependent on the atom's internal state.

abstract: We report a study of the axialisation and laser cooling of single ions and small clouds of ions in a Penning trap. A weak radiofrequency signal applied to a segmented ring electrode couples the magnetron motion to the cyclotron motion, which results in improved laser cooling of the magnetron motion. This allows us to approach the trapping conditions of a Paul trap, but without any micromotion. Using an ICCD camera we show that the motion of a single ion can be confined to dimensions of the order of 10 $\mu$m. We have measured increased magnetron cooling rates using an rf-photon correlation technique. For certain laser cooling conditions, the magnetron motion of the centre of mass of the cloud grows and stabilises at a large value. This results in the ions orbiting the centre of the trap together in a small cloud, as confirmed by photon-photon correlation measurements.

abstract: The behavior of entangled quantum systems can generally not be explained as being determined by shared classical randomness. In the first part of this paper, we propose a simple game for n players demonstrating this non-local property of quantum mechanics: While, on the one hand, it is immediately clear that classical players will lose the game with substantial probability, it can, on the other hand, always be won by players sharing an entangled quantum state. The simplicity of the classical analysis of our game contrasts the often quite involved analysis of previously proposed examples of this type. In the second part, aiming at a quantitative characterization of the non-locality of n-partite quantum states, we consider a general class of n-player games, where the amount of communication between certain (randomly chosen) groups of players is measured. Comparing the classical communication needed for both classical players and quantum players (initially sharing a given quantum state) to win such a game, a new type of separation results is obtained. In particular, we show that in order to simulate two separated qubits of an n-partite GHZ state at least (roughly) log(log(n)) bits of information are required.

abstract: Quantum entanglement in multipartite systems cannot be shared freely. In order to illuminate basic rules of entanglement sharing between qubits we introduce a concept of an entangled structure (graph) such that each qubit of a multipartite system is associated with a point (vertex) while a bi-partite entanglement between two specific qubits is represented by a connection (edge) between these points. We prove that any such entangled structure can be associated with a pure state of a multi-qubit system. Moreover, we show that a pure state corresponding to a given entangled structure is a superposition of vectors from a subspace of the $2^N$-dimensional Hilbert space, whose dimension grows linearly with the number of entangled pairs.

abstract: In contrast to the Copenhagen interpretation we consider quantum mechanics as universally valid and query whether classical physics is really intuitive and plausible. - We discuss these problems within the quantum logic approach to quantum mechanics where the classical ontology is relaxed by reducing metaphysical hypotheses. On the basis of this weak ontology a formal logic of quantum physics can be established which is given by an orthomodular lattice. By means of the Soler condition and Piron's result one obtains the classical Hilbert spaces. - However, this approach is not fully convincing. There is no plausible justification of Soler's law and the quantum ontology is partly too weak and partly too strong. We propose to replace this ontology by an ontology of unsharp properties and conclude that quantum mechanics is more intuitive than classical mechanics and that classical mechanics is not the macroscopic limit of quantum mechanics.

abstract: The N-qubit states of the W class, for N>10, lead to more robust (against noise admixture) violations of local realism, than the GHZ states. These violations are most pronounced for correlations for a pair of qubits, conditioned on specific measurement results for the remaining (N-2) qubits. The considerations provide us with a qualitative difference between the W state and GHZ state in the situation when they are separately sent via depolarizing channels. For sufficiently high amount of noise in the depolarizing channel, the GHZ states cannot produce a distillable state between two qubits, whereas the W states can still produce a distillable state in a similar situation.

abstract: Time flow has been embodied in time-dependent Schroedinger equation representing one of the foundations of quantum mechanics. Pauli's criticism (1933) has, however, indicated that the assumptions concerning representation Hilbert space have led to some contradictions. Many authors have tried to solve this discrepancy practically without any actual success. The reason may be seen in that two different problems have been mixed: the problem of Pauli (being more general and more important) and non-unitarity of exponential phase operator of linear harmonic oscillator introduced by Dirac, as demonstrated in 1964. The problem will be discussed in a broad historical context and a solution based on extension of representation Hilbert space will be shown.

These new combinatorial numbers are shown to be coherent state matrix elements of powers of the monomials in question. It is further demonstrated that such Bell-type numbers, when considered as power moments, give rise to positive measures on the positive half-axis, which in many cases can be written in terms of known functions.

abstract: The Quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a key ingredient in most quantum algorithms. We have compared various spin-based quantum computing schemes to implement the QFT from the point of view of their actual time-costs and the accuracy of the implementation. We focus here on an interesting decomposition of the QFT as a product of the non-selective Hadamard transformation followed by multiqubit gates corresponding to square- and higher-roots of controlled-NOT gates. This decomposition requires only O(n) operations and is thus linear in the number of qubits $n$. The schemes were implemented on a two-qubit NMR quantum information processor and the resultant density matrices reconstructed using standard quantum state tomography techniques. Their experimental fidelities have been measured and compared.

When data consistent with its derivation are analyzed without imposition of the stationarity assumption, the resulting correlations satisfy the Bell inequality.

abstract: We present a robust continuous optical loading scheme for a Ioffe-Pritchard (IP) type magnetic trap. Atoms are cooled and trapped in a modified magneto-optical trap (MOT) consisting of a conventional 2D-MOT in radial direction and an axial molasses. The radial magnetic field gradient needed for the operation of the 2D-MOT is provided by the IP trap. A small axial curvature and offset field provide magnetic confinement and suppress spin-flip losses in the center of the magnetic trap without altering the performance of the 2D-MOT. Continuous loading of atoms into the IP trap is provided by radiative leakage from the MOT to a metastable level which is magnetically trapped and decoupled from the MOT light. We are able to accumulate 30 times more atoms in the magnetic trap than in the MOT. The absolute number of $2\times 10^8$~atoms is limited by inelastic collisions. A model based on rate equations shows good agreement with our data. Our scheme can also be applied to other atoms with similar level structure like alkaline earth metals.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of a classically chaotic model are studied in the approach to the macroscopic limit. The quantum predictions are compared and contrasted with the classical predictions of both Newtonian and Liouville mechanics. The time-domain scaling of the optimal quantum-classical correspondence is analyzed in detail in the case of both classical theories. In both cases the correspondence for observable quantities is shown to break down on a time-scale that increases very slowly (logarithmically) with increasing system size. In the case of quantum-Liouville correspondence such a short time-scale does not imply a breakdown of correspondence since the largest quantum-Liouville differences reached on this time-scale decrease rapidly (as an inverse power) with increasing system size. Therefore the statistical properties of chaotic dynamics are, as expected, well described by quantum theory in the macroscopic limit. In contrast, the largest quantum-Newtonian differences reached on the log time-scale actually increase in proportion to the system size. Since the invariance properties of the Hamiltonian impose functional constraints on the time-varying chaotic coordinates, it is possible to show, moreover, that if the quantum predictions are believed to describe the coordinates of individual chaotic systems, then they also predict macroscopic violations of any kinematic or dynamic constants of the motion. These results for chaotic systems indicate that a valid description of the time-varying properties of individual macroscopic bodies is not available within the standard interpretive framework of quantum theory.

abstract: While ultimately they are described by quantum mechanics, macroscopic mechanical systems are nevertheless observed to follow the trajectories predicted by classical mechanics. Hence, in the regime defining macroscopic physics, the trajectories of the correct classical motion must emerge from quantum mechanics, a process referred to as the quantum to classical transition. Extending previous work [Bhattacharya, Habib, and Jacobs, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 4852 (2000)], here we elucidate this transition in some detail, showing that once the measurement processes which affect all macroscopic systems are taken into account, quantum mechanics indeed predicts the emergence of classical motion. We derive inequalities that describe the parameter regime in which classical motion is obtained, and provide numerical examples. We also demonstrate two further important properties of the classical limit. First, that multiple observers all agree on the motion of an object, and second, that classical statistical inference may be used to correctly track the classical motion.

abstract: A fully optical method to perform any quantum computation with optical waveguide modes is proposed by supplying the prescriptions for a universal set of quantum gates. The proposal for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two normal modes of multi-mode waveguides. The proposed universal set of gates has the potential of being more compact and easily realized than other optical implementations, since it is based on planar lightwave circuit technology and can be constructed by using Mach-Zehnder interferometer configurations having semiconductor optical amplifiers with very high refractive nonlinearity in their arms.

abstract: Quantisation on spaces with properties of curvature, multiple connectedness and non orientablility is obtained. The geodesic length spectrum for the Laplacian operator is extended to solve the Schroedinger operator. Homotopy fundamental group representations are used to obtain a direct sum of Hilbert spaces, with a Holonomy method for the non simply connected manifolds.The covering spaces of isometric and hence isospectral manifolds are used to obtain the representation of states on orientable and non orientable spaces. Problems of deformations of the operators and the domains are discussed.Possible applications of the geometric and topological effects in physics are mentioned.

abstract: The formalism of classical and quantum mechanics on phase space leads to symplectic and Heisenberg group representations, respectively. The Wigner functions give a representation of the quantum system using classical variables. The correspondence between the classical and the quantum criterion of separability for the system is obtained in terms of these functions. Entanglement is generic and separability is special. Some applications are discussed in commonly occuring examples and possibly in exotic systems.

To illustrate the technique it is applied to find control schemes to achieve population transfers for pure-state systems, complete inversions of the ensemble populations for mixed-state systems, create arbitrary superposition states and optimize the ensemble average of dynamic observables.

abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum dynamics of the center of mass of trapped atoms, whose internal degrees of freedom are driven in a $\Lambda$-shaped configuration with the lasers tuned at two-photon resonance. In the Lamb-Dicke regime, when the motional wave packet is well localized over the laser wavelenght, transient coherent population trapping occurs, cancelling transitions at the laser frequency. In this limit the motion can be efficiently cooled to the ground state of the trapping potential. We derive an equation for the center-of-mass motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom. This treatment provides the theoretical background of the scheme presented in [G. Morigi {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 4458 (2000)] and implemented in [C.F. Roos {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 5547 (2000)]. We discuss the physical mechanisms determining the dynamics and identify new parameters regimes, where cooling is efficient. We discuss implementations of the scheme to cases where the trapping potential is not harmonic.

abstract: We present a robust method for quantum process tomography, which yields a set of Lindblad operators that optimally fit the measured density operators at a sequence of time points. The benefits of this method are illustrated using a set of liquid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements on a molecule containing two coupled hydrogen nuclei, which are sufficient to fully determine its relaxation superoperator. It was found that the complete positivity constraint, which is necessary for the existence of the Lindblad operators, was also essential for obtaining a robust fit to the measurements. The general approach taken here promises to be broadly useful in studying dissipative quantum processes in many of the diverse experimental systems currently being developed for quantum information processing purposes.

abstract: Hidden variables theories for quantum mechanics are usually assumed to satisfy the KS condition. The Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem then shows that these theories are necessarily contextual. But the KS condition can be criticized from an operational viewpoint, which suggests that a weaker condition (MGP) should be adopted in place of it. This leads one to introduce a class of hidden parameters theories in which contextuality can, in principle, be avoided, since the proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem break down. A simple model recently provided by the author for an objective interpretation of quantum mechanics can be looked at as a noncontextual hidden parameters theory, which shows that such theories actually exist.

abstract: The Lewenstein-Sanpera decomposition for a generic two-qubit density matrix is obtained by using Wootters's basis. It is shown that the average concurrence of the decomposition is equal to the concurrence of the state. It is also shown that all the entanglement content of the state is concentrated in the Wootters's state $|x_1>$ associated with the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Hermitian matrix $\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\tilde{\rho}\sqrt{\rho}}$ >. It is shown that a given density matrix $\rho$ with corresponding set of positive numbers $\lambda_i$ and Wootters's basis can transforms under $SO(4,c)$ into a generic $2\times2$ matrix with the same set of positive numbers but with new Wootters's basis, where the local unitary transformations correspond to $SO(4,r)$ transformations, hence, $\rho$ can be represented as coset space $SO(4,c)/SO(4,r)$ together with positive numbers $\lambda_i$. By giving an explicit parameterization we characterize a generic orbit of group of local unitary transformations.

abstract: We prove a lower bound for Schmidt numbers of bipartite mixed states. This lower bound can be applied easily to low rank bipartite mixed states. From this lower bound it is known that generic low rank bipartite mixed states have relatively high Schmidt numbers and thus entangled. We can compute Schmidt numbers exactly for some mixed states by this lower bound as shown in Examples. This lower bound can also be used effectively to determine that some mixed states cannot be convertible to other mixed states by local operations and classical communication. The results in this paper are proved by ONLY using linear algebra, thus the results and proof are easy to understand.

This scheme involves the standard mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics. Simultaneously, it contains a mathematical object that adequately describes a single experiment. We give an example of the application of the proposed scheme.

With regard to the quantum measurement problem, semigroups of this kind ensure decoherence and the selection of a single state from the familiy of pointer states. In fact, the common fixed point is the selected state.

Maximally entangled coherent excitonic states can be generated by cavity field initially prepared in odd coherent state. The entanglement of the excitonic coherent states between two dots reaches maximum when no photon is detected in the cavity. The effects of the zero-temperature environment on the entanglement of excitonic coherent state are also studied using the concurrence for two subsystems of the excitons

abstract: For a transition $F_e=0\leftrightarrow F_g=1$ driven by a linearly polarized light and probed by a circularly light, quantum coherence effects are investigated. Due to the coherence between the drive Rabi frequency and Zeeman splitting, electromagnetically induced transparency, electromagnetically induced absorption, and the transition from positive to negative dispersion are obtained, as well as the populations coherently oscillating in a wide spectral region. At the zero pump-probe detuning, the subluminal and superluminal light propagation is predicted. Finally, coherent population trapping states are not highly sensitive to the refraction and absorption in such ensemble.

They match the well-known expansion coefficients of the Mathieu equation's characteristic values.

The standard rule while giving exellent results for the anharmonic oscillator fails completely in this case.

abstract: The collective Raman cooling of trapped one- and two-component Fermi gases is considered. We obtain the quantum master equation that describes the laser cooling in the festina lente regime, for which the heating due to photon reabsorption can be neglected. For the two-component case the collisional processes are described within the formalism of quantum Boltzmann master equation. The inhibition of the spontaneous emission can be overcome by properly adjusting the spontaneous Raman rate during the cooling. Our numerical results based in Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding rate equations, show that three-dimensional temperatures of the order of $0.08 T_F$ (single-component) and $0.03 T_F$ (two-component) can be achieved. We investigate the statistical properties of the equilibrium distribution of the laser-cooled gas, showing that the number fluctuations are enhanced compared with the thermal distribution close to the Fermi surface. Finally, we analyze the heating related to the background losses, concluding that our laser-cooling scheme should maintain the temperature of the gas without significant additional losses.

abstract: The explanation presented in [Taichenachev et al, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 61}, 011802 (2000)] according to which the electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) resonances observed in degenerate two level systems are due to coherence transfer from the excited to the ground state is experimentally tested in a Hanle type experiment observing the parametric resonance on the $% D1$ line of $^{87}$Rb. While EIA occurs in the $F=1\to F^{\prime}=2 $ transition in a cell containing only $Rb$ vapor, collisions with a buffer gas ($30 torr$ of $Ne$) cause the sign reversal of this resonance as a consequence of collisional decoherence of the excited state. A theoretical model in good qualitative agreement with the experimental results is presented.

This result is based on a new binning process called root binning, that is used to transform the continuous variables measurements into binary results needed for the tests of quantum mechanics versus local realistic theories. A physical process in order to produce such states is also suggested. The use of high-efficiency spacelike separated homodyne detections with these states and this binning process would result in a conclusive loophole-free test of quantum mechanics.

The model of the game interaction is constructed on the basis of a non-distributive orthocomplemented lattice. Mixed strategies of the participants are calculated by the use of probability amplitudes according to the rules of quantum mechanics. A scheme of quantization of the payoff function is proposed and an algorithm for the search of Nash equilibrium is given. It is shown that differently from the classical case in the quantum situation a discrete set of equilibrium is possible.

abstract: It is known that there is no possibility of transmitting information without a certain amount of energy. This is arbitrarily small in Classical Physics, due to the continuous nature of the energy parameter, while one cannot reduce that amount below Planck's energy quanta in Quantum Physics. In short, one cannot send less than a photon from a place to another when transmitting a minimum of information. However, as single photons are never completely defined simultaneously in all their parameters as position and momentum, their exact contribution to the information transmitted cannot be known in advance, but only probabilistically predicted. So the information transmitted is always blurred before one can - in a way that is only probabilistically predictable - localize or, alternatively, determine the momenta of the photons transporting it. In order to enhance the information content of a message, is it then really possible to exploit the situation by considering the information contained in a superposition state before localization or, alternatively, determination of momenta? It would be so if such blurred information were richer than a defined one, the former being vaguer than the latter as it would be compatible with more possible outputs, and only in this sense more extensive. But if one defines the information content of a state as the negative logarithm of the probability of the state itself, it is not possible to identify the more a priori probable blurred information pertaining to that state with the bigger one. Then the idea of exploiting a supposedly enhanced information content of superposition states in Quantum Computation seems to contradict directly - but, as we will se, without necessity - the classical probabilistic definition of information.

abstract: Tunneling of vortex-antivortex pairs across a superconducting film can be controlled via inductive coupling of the film to an external circuit. We study this process numerically in a toroidal film (periodic boundary conditions in both directions) by using the dual description of vortices, in which they are represented by a fundamental quantum field. We compare the results to those obtained in the instanton approach.

abstract: It is important to protect quantum information against decoherence and operational errors, and quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes are the keys to solving this problem. Of course, just the existence of codes is not efficient. It is necessary to perform operations fault-tolerantly on encoded states because error-correction process (i.e., encoding, decoding, syndrome measurement and recovery) itself induces an error. By using simulation, this paper investigates the effects of some important QEC codes (the five qubit code, the seven qubit code and the nine qubit code) and their fault-tolerant operations when the error-correction process itself induces an error. The corresponding results, statistics and analyses are presented in this paper.

abstract: Quantum heat engines employ as working agents multi-level systems instead of gas-filled cylinders. We consider particularly two-level agents such as electrons immersed in a magnetic field. Work is produced in that case when the electrons are being carried from a high-magnetic-field region into a low-magnetic-field region. In watermills, work is produced instead when some amount of fluid drops from a high-altitude reservoir to a low-altitude reservoir. We show that this purely mechanical engine may in fact be considered as a two-level quantum heat engine, provided the fluid is viewed as consisting of n molecules of weight one and N-n molecules of weight zero. Weight-one molecules are analogous to electrons in their higher energy state, while weight-zero molecules are analogous to electrons in their lower energy state. More generally, fluids consist of non-interacting molecules of various weights. It is shown that, not only the average value of the work produced per cycle, but also its fluctuations, are the same for mechanical engines and quantum (Otto) heat engines. The reversible Carnot cycles are approached through the consideration of multiple sub-reservoirs.

abstract: The probabilistic structure of quantum mechanics is investigated in the frequency framework. Such an approach can be interpreted as a contextual approach to quantum probabilities. By using rather complicated frequency calculations we reproduce the EPR-Bohm correlation function which is typically derived by using the calculus of probabilities in a Hilbert space. Our frequency probabilistic model of the EPR-Bohm experiment is a realist model -- physical observables are considered as objective properties of physical systems. It is also local -- a measurement over one part of a composite system does not disturb another part of this system. Nevertheless, our result does not contradict to the well known Bell's ``NO-GO'' theorem. J. Bell used the conventional (Kolmogorov) measure-theoretical approach. We use the frequency approach. In the latter approach there are no reasons to assume that the simultaneous probability distribution exists: corresponding frequencies may fluctuate and not approach any definite limit (which Bell would like to use as the probability). The frequency probabilistic derivation demonstrated that incompatibility of observables under consideration plays the crucial role in producing of the EPR-Bohm correlations.

abstract: Quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature and involve the appearance of long-range correlations. These correlations are not due to thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to $L$ spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with $L$, with a coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition. Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science, obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a critical point.

abstract: It is shown that the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger theorem can be generalized to the case with only two entangled particles. The reasoning makes use of two photons which are maximally entangled both in polarization and in spatial degrees of freedom. In contrast to Cabello's argument of "all versus nothing" nonlocality with four photons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 010403 (2001)], our proposal to test the theorem can be implemented with linear optics and thus is well within the reach of current experimental technology.

abstract: We study the coherent inelastic diffraction of very weakly bound two body clusters from a material transmission grating. We show that internal transitions of the clusters can lead to new separate peaks in the diffraction pattern whose angular positions determine the excitation energies. Using a quantum mechanical approach to few body scattering theory we determine the relative peak intensities for the diffraction of the van der Waals dimers (D_2)_2 and H_2-D_2. Based on the results for these realistic examples we discuss the possible applications and experimental challenges of this coherent inelastic diffraction technique.

In a more general setting, to capture the relativity and variability of our structures with respect to the observation means, sheaves of algebras may need be introduced. We provide the general formalism based on algebras which exhibits the relativity of multipartiteness and localization.

abstract: There is an opinion that the Bohm reformulation of the EPR paradox in terms of spin variables is equivalent to the original one. In this note we show that such an opinion is not justified. We apply to the original EPR problem the method which was used by Bell for the Bohm reformulation. He has shown that correlation function of two spins cannot be represented by classical correlation of separated bounded random processes. This Bell`s theorem has been interpreted as incompatibility of local realism with quantum mechanics. We show that, in contrast to Bell`s theorem for spin or polarization correlation functions, the correlation of positions (or momenta) of two particles, depending on the rotation angles, in the original EPR model always admits a representation in the form of classical correlation of separated random processes. In this sense there exists a local realistic representation for the original EPR model but there is no such a representation for the Bohm spin reformulation of the EPR paradox. It shows also that the phenomena of quantum nonlocality is based not only on the properties of entangled states but also on the using of particular bounded observables.

abstract: The application of dynamical decoupling pulses to a single qubit interacting with a linear harmonic oscillator bath with $1/f$ spectral density is studied, and compared to the Ohmic case. Decoupling pulses that are slower than the fastest bath time-scale are shown to drastically reduce the decoherence rate in the $1/f$ case. Contrary to conclusions drawn from previous studies, this shows that dynamical decoupling pulses do not always have to be ultra-fast. Our results explain a recent experiment in which dephasing due to $1/f$ charge noise affecting a charge qubit in a small superconducting electrode was successfully suppressed using spin-echo-type gate-voltage pulses.

abstract: We generalize the classical probability frame by adopting a wider family of random variables that includes nondeterministic ones. The frame that emerges is known to host a ''classical'' extension of quantum mechanics. We discuss the notion of probabilistic correlation and show that it includes two kinds of correlation: a classical one, which occurs for both deterministic and indeterministic observables, and a nonclassical one, which occurs only for indeterministic observables. The latter will be called probabilistic entanglement and represents a property of intrinsically random systems, not necessarily quantum. It appears possible to separate the two kinds of correlation and characterize them by numerical functions which satisfy a simple product rule.

Kim gives rise to two uncorrelated generalized depolarizing channels. In an attempt to find a teleportation scheme which yields two correlated generalized depolarizing channels, we discover a novel teleportation scheme, which allows one to learn about the entanglement in an entangled pure input state, but without decreasing the amount of entanglement associated with it.

A physical interpretation of conservativeness in terms of conservation of the energy associated to the data used during the computation is given. Moreover, we define conservative computations, and we show that they naturally induce a new NP-complete decision problem. Finally, we present a framework that can be used to explicit the movement of energy occurring during a computation, and we provide a quantum implementation of the primitives of such framework using creation and annihilation operators on the Hilbert space C^d, where d is the number of energy levels considered in the framework.

abstract: A quantum communication architecture is being developed for long-distance, high-fidelity qubit teleportation. It uses an ultrabright narrowband source of polarization-entangled photons, plus trapped-atom quantum memories, and it is compatible with long-distance transmission over standard telecommunication fiber. This paper reports error models for the preceding teleportation architecture, and for an extension thereto which enables long-distance transmission and storage of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. The use of quantum error correction or entanglement purification to improve the performance of these quantum communication architectures is also discussed.

abstract: A recently developed theory for eliminating decoherence and design constraints in quantum computers, ``encoded recoupling and decoupling'', is shown to be fully compatible with a promising proposal for an architecture enabling scalable ion-trap quantum computation [D. Kielpinski et al., Nature 417, 709 (2002)]. Logical qubits are encoded into pairs of ions. Logic gates are implemented using the Sorensen-Molmer (SM) scheme applied to pairs of ions at a time. The encoding offers continuous protection against collective dephasing. Decoupling pulses, that are also implemented using the SM scheme directly to the encoded qubits, are capable of further reducing various other sources of qubit decoherence, such as due to differential dephasing and due to decohered vibrational modes. The feasibility of using the relatively slow SM pulses in a decoupling scheme quenching the latter source of decoherence follows from the observed 1/f spectrum of the vibrational bath.

We demonstrate the converse derivation in part, and consider the implications of alternative answers to a remaining open question about nonlocality and bit commitment.

abstract: Exceptional points are singularities of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for complex values of, say, an interaction parameter. They occur universally and are square root branch point singularities of the eigenvalues in the vicinity of level repulsions. The intricate connection between the distribution of exceptional points and particular fluctuation properties of level spacing is discussed. The distribution of the exceptional points of the problem $H_0+\lambda H_1$ is given for the situation of hard chaos. Theoretical predictions of local properties of exceptional points have recently been confirmed experimentally. This relates to the specific topological structure of an exceptional point as well as to the chiral properties of the wave functions associated with exceptional points.

Our algorithms are recursive. For the base case, we solve efficiently Hidden Translation in $\Z_{p}^{n}$, whenever $p$ is a fixed prime. For the induction step, we introduce the problem Translating Coset generalizing both Hidden Translation and Hidden Subgroup, and prove a powerful self-reducibility result: Translating Coset in a finite solvable group $G$ is reducible to instances of Translating Coset in $G/N$ and $N$, for appropriate normal subgroups $N$ of $G$. Our self-reducibility framework combined with Kuperberg's subexponential quantum algorithm for solving Hidden Translation in any abelian group, leads to subexponential quantum algorithms for Hidden Translation and Hidden Subgroup in any solvable group.

We show how an arbitrary tensor product state can be described in a complete way by a specific internal constraint between the ray or density states of the two spin 1/2. We derive a geometrical view of entanglement as a 'rotation' and 'stretching' of the sphere representing the states of the second particle as measurements are performed on the first particle. In the case of the singlet state entanglement can be represented by a real physical constraint, namely by means of a rigid rod.

abstract: The structure of a state property system was introduced to formalize in a complete way the operational content of the Geneva-Brussels approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics, and the category of state property systems was proven to be equivalence to the category of closure spaces. The first axioms of standard quantum axiomatics (state determination and atomisticity) have been shown to be equivalent to the $T_0$ and $T_1$ axioms of closure spaces, and classical properties to correspond to clopen sets, leading to a decomposition theorem into classical and purely nonclassical components for a general state property system. The concept of orthogonality, very important for quantum axiomatics, had however not yet been introduced within the formal scheme of the state property system. In this paper we introduce orthogonality in a operational way, and define ortho state property systems. Birkhoff's well known biorthogonal construction gives rise to an orthoclosure and we study the relation between this orthoclosure and the operational orthogonality that we introduced.

The resulting Markov field is equivalent to the Euclidean Markov field with the times scaled by a common factor which depends on the diffusion parameter. This result is consistent between Guerra's earlier work on stochastic quantization of scalar fields. It suggests a deep connection between Euclidean field theory and the stochastic interpretation of quantum mechanics. The question of Lorentz covariance is also discussed.

Two communicating parties, Alice and Bob first share a both polarization- and path-entangled photon pair, and then each performs a complete Bell-state measurement on their own photon in one of two complementary Bell-state bases. It is demonstrated that each measurement in which both Alice and Bob register a photon can build certain perfect correlation and generate 1.5 key bits on average. The security of our protocol is guaranteed by the non-cloning theorem.

The experimental language QCL will be introduced as an example, how elements like irreversible functions, local variables and conditional branching, which have no direct quantum counterparts, can be implemented, and how non-classical features like the reversibility of unitary transformation or the non-observability of quantum states can be accounted for within the framework of a procedural programming language.

It is implemented by sending single atoms, one by one, through the cavity. The atomic state gets first correlated to the photon number parity. The wrong parity results in an atom in the upper state. The atom in this state is then used to inject a photon in the mode via adiabatic transfer, correcting the field parity. By solving numerically the exact master equation of the system, we show that the protection of simple quantum states could be experimentally demonstrated using presently available experimental apparatus.

abstract: We discuss how the optomechanical coupling provided by radiation pressure can be used to cool macroscopic collective degrees of freedom, as vibrational modes of movable mirrors. Cooling is achieved using a phase-sensitive feedback-loop which effectively overdamps the mirrors motion without increasing the thermal noise. Feedback results able to bring macroscopic objects down to the quantum limit. In particular, it is possible to achieve squeezing and entanglement.

abstract: We analyse the quantum mechanical limits to the plasmon-assisted entanglement transfer observed by E. Altewischer, M.P. van Exter, and J.P. Woerdman [Nature, 418, 304 (2002)]. The maximal violation S of Bell's inequality at the photodetectors behind two linear media (such as the perforated metal films in the experiment) can be described by two ratio's tau_1, tau_2 of polarization-dependent transmission probabilities. A fully entangled incident state is transferred without degradation for tau_1=tau_2, but a relatively large mismatch of tau_1 and tau_2 can be tolerated with a small reduction of S. We predict that fully entangled Bell pairs can be distilled out of partially entangled radiation if tau_1 and tau_2 satisfy a pair of inequalities.

abstract: An extended analysis is given of the program, originally suggested by Deutsch, of solving the probability problem in the Everett interpretation by means of decision theory. Deutsch's own proof is discussed, and alternatives are presented which are based upon different decision theories and upon Gleason's Theorem. It is argued that decision theory gives Everettians most or all of what they need from `probability'. Some consequences of (Everettian) quantum mechanics for decision theory itself are also discussed.

abstract: Non-commutative propositions are characteristic of both quantum and non-quantum (sociological, biological, psychological) situations. In a Hilbert space model states, understood as correlations between all the possible propositions, are represented by density matrices. If systems in question interact via feedback with environment their dynamics is nonlinear. Nonlinear evolutions of density matrices lead to phenomena of morphogenesis which may occur in non-commutative systems. Several explicit exactly solvable models are presented, including `birth and death of an organism' and `development of complementary properties'.

abstract: The Feynman path integral for the generalized harmonic oscillator is reviewed, and it is shown that the path integral can be used to find a complete set of wave functions for the oscillator. Harmonic oscillators with different (time-dependent) parameters can be related through unitary transformations. The existence of generalized coherent states for a simple harmonic oscillator can then be interpreted as the result of a (formal) {\em invariance} under a unitary transformation which relates the same harmonic oscillator. In the path integral formalism, the invariance is reflected in that the kernels do not depend on the choice of classical solutions.

To show the practical utility of this method, exact closed-form expressions are derived for the control dynamics and quantum noise levels of a test mass observed by a Fabry-Perot interferometer. This formalism provides an efficient yet rigorous method for analyzing complex systems such as interferometric gravity wave detectors and magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) experiments. Quantum limits are conjectured for the sensitivity of interferometric observation of test mass trajectories.

abstract: Quantities associated with Casimir forces are calculated in a model wave system of one spatial dimension with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. 1)Due to zero-point fluctuations, a partition is attracted to the walls of a box if the wave boundary conditions are alike for the partition and the walls, but is repelled if the conditions are different. 2)The use of Casimir energies in the presence of zero-point radiation introduces a natural maximum-entropy principle which is satisfied only by the Planck spectrum for both like and unlike boundary conditions between the box and partition. 3)The Casimir forces are attractive and increasing with temperature for like boundary conditions, but are repulsive and decreasing with temperature for unlike conditions. 4)In the high-temperature limit, there is a temperature-independent Casimir entropy for like but not for unlike boundary conditions. These results have 3-dimensional electromagnetic counterparts.

abstract: We investigate how the dynamical production of quantum entanglement for weakly coupled, composite quantum systems is influenced by the chaotic dynamics of the corresponding classical system, using coupled kicked tops. The linear entropy for the subsystem (a kicked top) is employed as a measure of entanglement. A perturbative formula for the entanglement production rate is derived. The formula contains a correlation function that can be evaluated only from the information of uncoupled tops. Using this expression and the assumption that the correlation function decays exponentially which is plausible for chaotic tops, it is shown that {\it the increment of the strength of chaos does not enhance the production rate of entanglement} when the coupling is weak enough and the subsystems (kicked tops) are strongly chaotic. The result is confirmed by numerical experiments. The perturbative approach is also applied to a weakly chaotic region, where tori and chaotic sea coexist in the corresponding classical phase space, to reexamine a recent numerical study that suggests an intimate relationship between the linear stability of the corresponding classical trajectory and the entanglement production rate.

abstract: We develop a sufficient condition for the least-squares measurement (LSM), or the square-root measurement, to minimize the probability of a detection error when distinguishing between a collection of mixed quantum states. Using this condition we derive the optimal measurement for state sets with a broad class of symmetries. We first consider geometrically uniform (GU) state sets with a possibly nonabelian generating group, and show that if the generator satisfies a certain constraint, then the LSM is optimal. In particular, for pure-state GU ensembles the LSM is shown to be optimal. For arbitrary GU state sets we show that the optimal measurement operators are GU with generator that can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time, within any desired accuracy. We then consider compound GU (CGU) state sets which consist of subsets that are GU. When the generators satisfy a certain constraint, the LSM is again optimal. For arbitrary CGU state sets the optimal measurement operators are shown to be CGU with generators that can be computed efficiently in polynomial time.

abstract: Entangled states play a crucial role in quantum information protocols, thus the dynamical behavior of entanglement is of a great importance. In this paper we consider a two-mode squeezed vacuum state coupled to one thermal reservoir as a model of an entangled state embedded in an environment. As a criterion for entanglement we use a continuous-variable equivalent of the Peres-Horodecki criterion, namely the Simon criterion. To quantify entanglement we use the logarithmic negativity. We derive a condition, which assures that the state remains entangled in spite of the interaction with the reservoir. Moreover for the case of interaction with vacuum as an environment we show that a state of interest after intinitely long interaction is not only entangled, but also pure. For comparison we also consider a model in which each of both modes is coupled to its own reservoir.

abstract: Generation of Wigner functions of Landau levels and determination of their symmetries and generic properties are achieved in the autonomous framework of deformation quantization. Transformation properties of diagonal Wigner functions under space inversion, time reversal and parity transformations are specified and their invariance under a four-parameter subgroup of symplectic transformations are established. A generating function for all Wigner functions is developed and this has been identified as the phase-space coherent state for Landau levels. Integrated forms of generating function are used in generating explicit expressions of marginal probability densities on all possible two dimensional phase-space planes. Phase-space realization of unitary similarity and gauge transformations as well as some general implications for the Wigner function theory are presented.

abstract: The restricted-path-integral (RPI) description of a continuous quantum measurement is rederived starting from the description of an open system by the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. For this end the total evolution operator of the compound system consisting of the open system and its environment is decomposed into the sum of partial evolution operators. Accordingly, the influence functional of the open system is decomposed into the integral of partial influence functionals (PIF). If the partial evolution operators or PIF are chosen in such a way that they decohere (do not interfere with each other), then the formalism of RPI effectively arises. The evolution of the open system may then be interpreted as a continuous measurement of this system by its environment. This is possible if the environment is macroscopic or mesoscopic.

Our construction is fully algebraic, involving only the generators of the SU(1,1) group.

abstract: We consider the problem of designing an optimal quantum detector with a fixed rate of inconclusive results that maximizes the probability of correct detection, when distinguishing between a collection of mixed quantum states. We develop a sufficient condition for the scaled inverse measurement to maximize the probability of correct detection for the case in which the rate of inconclusive results exceeds a certain threshold. Using this condition we derive the optimal measurement for linearly independent pure-state sets, and for mixed-state sets with a broad class of symmetries. Specifically, we consider geometrically uniform (GU) state sets and compound geometrically uniform (CGU) state sets with generators that satisfy a certain constraint. We then show that the optimal measurements corresponding to GU and CGU state sets with arbitrary generators are also GU and CGU respectively, with generators that can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time within any desired accuracy by solving a semidefinite programming problem.

This methodology enables us to truly derive a tight quadratic inequality as tests for full $n$-partite entanglement in various Bell-type correlation experiments on the systems that may not be identified as a collection of qubits, e.g., those involving photons measured by incomplete detectors. It is also proved that when the two measured observables are assumed to precisely anti-commute, a stronger quadratic inequality can be used as a witness of full $n$-partite entanglement.

abstract: It is shown that if a Hamiltonian $H$ is Hermitian, then there always exists an operator P having the following properties: (i) P is linear and Hermitian; (ii) P commutes with H; (iii) P^2=1; (iv) the nth eigenstate of H is also an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue (-1)^n. Given these properties, it is appropriate to refer to P as the parity operator and to say that H has parity symmetry, even though P may not refer to spatial reflection. Thus, if the Hamiltonian has the form H=p^2+V(x), where V(x) is real (so that H possesses time-reversal symmetry), then it immediately follows that H has PT symmetry. This shows that PT symmetry is a generalization of Hermiticity: All Hermitian Hamiltonians of the form H=p^2+V(x) have PT symmetry, but not all PT-symmetric Hamiltonians of this form are Hermitian.

abstract: Many quantum algorithms, including Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete log algorithms, proceed by reduction to a hidden subgroup problem, in which a subgroup H of a group G must be determined from a quantum state y uniformly supported on a left coset of H. These hidden subgroup problems are then solved by Fourier sampling: the quantum Fourier transform of y is computed and measured. When the underlying group is non-Abelian, two important variants of the Fourier sampling paradigm have been identified: the weak standard method, where only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full measurement occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method is indeed stronger, that is, whether there are hidden subgroups that can be reconstructed via the strong method but not by the weak, or any other known, method. In this article, we settle this question in the affirmative. We show that hidden subgroups of semidirect products of Z_p by Z_q, where q divides (p-1) and q = p / polylog(p), can be efficiently determined by the strong standard method. Furthermore, the weak standard method and the ``forgetful'' Abelian method are insufficient for these groups. We extend this to an information-theoretic solution for the hidden subgroup problem over semidirect products of Z_p by \Z_q where q divides (p-1) and, in particular, the Affine groups A_p. Finally, we prove a closure property for the class of groups over which the hidden subgroup problem can be solved efficiently.

Realistic detection schemes such as {\sc on/off} photodetection, homodyne detection and joint measurement of two-mode quadratures are analyzed in details. Imperfections of the apparatuses, such as nonunit quantum efficiency and finite resolution, are taken into account. We show that conditional {\sc on/off} photodetection provides a reliable scheme to verify nonclassicality, whereas conditional homodyning represents a tunable and robust source of squeezed light. We also describe optical teleportation as a conditional measurement, and evaluate the degrading effects of finite amount of entanglement, decoherence due to losses, and nonunit quantum efficiency.

A formalism developing these ideas in the more simple case of a microsystem interacting with a macroscopic system is briefly outlined, together with an application to the field of neutron optics. The obtained reduced description relies on a T-matrix formalism and has the property of complete positivity.

abstract: We introduce a novel property of bipartite quantum states, which we call "faithfulness", and we say that a state is faithful when acting with a channel on one of the two quantum systems, the output state carries a complete information about the channel. The concept of faithfulness can also be extended to sets of states, when the output states patched together carry a complete imprinting of the channel.

abstract: We present a scheme for the deterministic generation of N-photon Fock states from N three-level atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity. The method applies an external laser pulsethat generates an $N$-photon output state while adiabatically keeping the atom-cavity system within a subspace of optically dark states. We present analytical estimates of the error due to amplitude leakage from these dark states for general N, and compare it with explicit results of numerical simulations for N \leq 5. The method is shown to provide a robust source of N-photon states under a variety of experimental conditions and is suitable for experimental implementation using a cloud of cold atoms magnetically trapped in a cavity. The resulting N-photon states have potential applications in fundamental studies of non-classical states and in quantum information processing.

abstract: Quantum entropy inequalities are studied. Some quantum entropy inequalities are obtained by several methods. For entanglement breaking channel, we show that the entanglement-assisted classical capacity is upper bounded by $\log d$. A relationship between entanglement-assisted and one-shot unassisted capacities is obtained. This relationship shows the entanglement-assisted channel capacity is upper bounded by the sum of $\log d$ and the one-shot unassisted classical capacity.

abstract: The Born rule is derived from operational assumptions, independent of the normalization of the state. Unlike Gleason's theorem, the argument applies even if probabilities are defined for only a single resolution of the identity, so it applies to all the major foundational approaches to quantum mechanics. There are important points of contact with Deutsch's program for deducing the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics from decision thoery, as recently completed by Wallace. Decision theory can be used to supplement the present derivation, in application to the Everett interpretation, but it is otherwise unnecessary.

In other words, for any partition $(n_1,n_2,...,n_p)$ of N with $n_j\ge 1$ and $N=\sum_{j=1}^{p}n_j$, the entanglement index for the corresponding state $\rho_{n_1}\bigotimes\rho_{n_2}...\bigotimes \rho_{n_p}$ with $\rho_{n_j}$ denoting a fully entangled state of $n_j-$qubits is $E(\rho_{n_1}\bigotimes\rho_{n_2}...\bigotimes \rho_{n_p})=\sum_{j=1}^{p}(n_j-1)=N-p$.

abstract: Almost all of the most successful quantum algorithms discovered to date exploit the ability of the Fourier transform to recover subgroup structure of functions, especially periodicity. The fact that Fourier transforms can also be used to capture shift structure has received far less attention in the context of quantum computation. In this paper, we present three examples of ``unknown shift'' problems that can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer using the quantum Fourier transform. We also define the hidden coset problem, which generalizes the hidden shift problem and the hidden subgroup problem. This framework provides a unified way of viewing the ability of the Fourier transform to capture subgroup and shift structure.

abstract: The laser control of photodissociation branching in a diatomic molecule is demonstrated to be effectively achieved with use of the complete reflection phenomenon. The phenomenon and the control condition can be nicely formulated by the semiclassical (Zhu-Nakamura) theory. The method is applied to the branching between I($^2 P_{3/2}$) (HI $\to$ H + I) and I$^*(^2 P_{1/2})$ (HI $\to$ H + I$^*$) formation, and nearly complete control is shown to be possible by appropriately choosing an initial vibrational state and laser frequency in spite of the fact that there are three electronically excited states involved. Numerical calculations of the corresponding wavepacket dynamics confirm the results.

The analytical results are obtained using the conventional time-dependent perturbation technique. Numerical estimations are made for arealistic sample of CdS quantum dots in a high-Q cavity. Quantum optical phenomena such as quantum Rabi oscillations, photon statistics and collapse and revival of population inversion in exciton and biexciton states are observed. In the presence of biexcitons the collapse and revival phenomenon becomes faster due to the strong coupling of biexciton with cavity field.

abstract: Using the supersymmetric quantum mechanics we investigate the wave function-sensitive properties of the supersymmetric potentials which have received a lot of attention in the literature recently. We show that a superdeep potential and its phase-equivalent shallow-partner potential give very similar "rms" values for the weakly bound systems such as the deuteron and 11Be nuclei. Although the corresponding eigenstates differ in the node-number, our investigation on the 11Be(p,d)10Be single nucleon halo transfer reaction at 35 MeV show that also other physical quantities such as the cross section angular distributions calculated using these wave functions reflect the nodal structure rather weakly. This lends support to two nearly equivalent treatments of the Pauli principle.

We show that entanglement detection for all these families of states requires only three local measurements. The explicit form of the corresponding set of local observables (quorom) needed for entanglement witness is derived.

Conditions which describe such sets of states have been derived.

Next, we formulate the non-signaling theorem and show that the theorem poses no additional restriction on Quantum Mechanics provided the kinematics is given. We also discuss validity of the postulate for the case of more general theories.

abstract: We extend to arbitrarily coupled pairs of qubits (two-state quantum systems) and qutrits (three-state quantum systems) our earlier study (quant-ph/0207181), which was concerned with the simplest instance of entangled quantum systems, pairs of qubits. As in that analysis -- again on the basis of numerical (quasi-Monte Carlo) integration results, but now in a still higher-dimensional space (35-d vs. 15-d) -- we examine a conjecture that the Bures/SD (statistical distinguishability) probability that arbitrarily paired qubits and qutrits are separable (unentangled) has a simple exact value, u/(v Pi^3)= >.00124706, where u = 2^20 3^3 5 7 and v = 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 (the product of consecutive primes). This is considerably less than the conjectured value of the Bures/SD probability, 8/(11 Pi^2) = 0736881, in the qubit-qubit case. Both of these conjectures, in turn, rely upon ones to the effect that the SD volumes of separable states assume certain remarkable forms, involving "primorial" numbers. We also estimate the SD area of the boundary of separable qubit-qutrit states, and provide preliminary calculations of the Bures/SD probability of separability in the general qubit-qubit-qubit and qutrit-qutrit cases.

Instead, computation can be performed entirely by adiabatically varying a magnetic field applied to all the qubits simultaneously. Local (incoherent) operations are needed only for: (1) switching on or off certain pairwise, nearest-neighbor inductive couplings in order to set the problem to be solved and (2) measuring some subset of the qubits in order to obtain the answer to the problem.

abstract: We propose a decoy-state method to overcome the photon-number-splitting attack for Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution protocol in the presence of high loss: A legitimate user intentionally and randomly replaces signal pulses by multi-photon pulses (decoy-states). Then they check the loss of the decoy-states. If the loss of the decoy-states is abnormally less than that of signal pulses, the whole protocol is aborted. Otherwise, to continue the protocol, they estimate loss of signal multi-photon pulses based on that of decoy-states. This estimation can be done with an assumption that the two losses have similar values, that we justify.

abstract: We present a numerical study of the quantum action previously introduced as a parametrisation of Q.M. transition amplitudes. We address the questions: Is the quantum action possibly an exact parametrisation in the whole range of transition times ($0 < T < \infty$)? Is the presence of potential terms beyond those occuring in the classical potential required? What is the error of the parametrisation estimated from the numerical fit? How about convergence and stability of the fitting method (dependence on grid points, resolution, initial conditions, internal precision etc.)? Further we compare two methods of numerical determination of the quantum action: (i) global fit of the Q.M. transition amplitudes and (ii) flow equation. As model we consider the inverse square potential, for which the Q.M. transition amplitudes are analytically known. We find that the relative error of the parametrisation starts from zero at T=0 increases to about $10^{-3}$ at $T=1/E_{gr}$ and then decreases to zero when $T \to \infty$. Second, we observe stability of the quantum action under variation of the control parameters. Finally, the flow equation method works well in the regime of large $T$ giving stable results under variation of initial data and consistent with the global fit method.

abstract: Practical implementations of quantum cryptography use attenuated laser pulses as the signal source rather than single photons. The channels used to transmit are also lossy. Here we give a simple derivation of two beam-splitting attacks on quantum cryptographic systems using laser pulses, either coherent or mixed states with any mean photon number. We also give a simple derivation of a photon-number splitting attack, the most advanced, both in terms of performance and technology required. We find bounds on the maximum disturbance for a given mean photon number and observed channel transmission efficiency for which a secret key can be distilled. We start by reviewing two incoherent attacks that can be used on single photon quantum cryptographic systems. These results are then adapted to systems that use laser pulses and lossy channels.

abstract: By considering the decomposition of a generic two qubit density matrix presented by Wootters [W. K. Wootters, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80} 2245 (1998)], the robustness of entanglement for any mixed state of two qubit systems is obtained algebraically. It is shown that the robustness of entanglement is proportional to concurrence and in Bell decomposable density matrices it is equal to the concurrence. We also give an analytic expression for two separable states which wipe out all entanglement of these states. Since thus obtained robustness is function of the norm of the vectors in the decomposition we give an explicit parameterization for the decomposition.

Further, we suggest a relativistic-invariant protocol for quantum communication, with which the non-relativistic quantum information theory could be invariantly applied to relativistic situations.

abstract: Several recently proposed implementations of scalable quantum computation rely on the ability to manipulate the spin polarization of individual electrons in semiconductors. The most rapid single-spin-manipulation technique to date relies on the generation of an effective magnetic field via a spin-sensitive optical Stark effect. This approach has been used to split spin states in colloidal CdSe quantum dots and to manipulate ensembles of spins in ZnMnSe quantum wells with femtosecond optical pulses. Here we report that the process will produce a coherent rotation of spin in quantum dots containing a single electron. The calculated magnitude of the effective magnetic field depends on the dot bandgap and the strain. We predict that in InAs/InP dots, for reasonable experimental parameters, the magnitude of the rotation is sufficient and the intrinsic error is low enough for them to serve as elements of a quantum dot based quantum computer.

Moreover, we show that a typical degeneracy of the real eigenvalues (which reduces to the well known Kramers degeneracy in the Hermitian case) occurs whenever a fermionic (possibly nondiagonalizable) pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian admits an antilinear symmetry like the time-reversal operator $T$. Some consequences and applications are briefly discussed.

Time orientability and existence of a cosmic time are necessary conditions for defining an arrow of time, which is manifested globally as the time-asymmetry of the universe as a whole, and locally as a time-asymmetric energy flux. We also consider arrows of time of different origins (quantum, electromagnetic, thermodynamic, etc.) showing that they can be non-conventionally defined only if the geometrical arrow is previously defined.

In particular, we will show that the self-induced approach may be used for describing the evolution of a closed quantum universe, whose classical behavior arises as a result of decoherence.

abstract: A recent discussion of quantum limitations to the fidelity with which superpositions of internal atomic energy levels can be generated by an applied, quantized, laser pulse is shown to be based on unrealistic physical assumptions. This discussion assumed the validity of Jaynes-Cummings dynamics for an atom interacting with a laser field in free space, that is, when the atom is not surrounded by a resonant cavity. If the laser field is a multimode quantum coherent state, and the Rabi frequency is much greater than the spontaneous decay rate, then the total atomic decoherence rate is on the order of the spontaneous decay rate. With the use of a unitary transformation of the field states due to Mollow, it can be shown that the atomic decoherence rate is the same as if the laser field were treated classically, without any additional contribution due to the quantum nature of the laser field.

abstract: In a recent paper it was shown that if a Hamiltonian H has an unbroken PT symmetry, then it also possesses a hidden symmetry represented by the linear operator C. The operator C commutes with both H and PT. The inner product with respect to CPT is associated with a positive norm and the quantum theory built on the associated Hilbert space is unitary. In this paper it is shown how to construct the operator C for the non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonian $H={1\over2}p^2+{1\over2}x^2 +i\epsilon x^3$ using perturbative techniques. It is also shown how to construct the operator C for $H={1\over2}p^2+{1\over2}x^2-\epsilon x^4$ using nonperturbative methods.

abstract: We consider a quantum gate, driven by a general time-dependent Hamiltonian, that complements the state of a qubit and then adds to it an arbitrary phase shift. It is shown that the minimum operation time of the gate is tau = (h/4E)(1+2 theta/pi), where h is Planck's constant, E is the average over time of the quantum-mechanical average energy, and theta is the phase shift modulo pi.

abstract: The bound state wave functions for a wide class of exactly solvable potentials are found utilizing the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. It is shown that, exploiting the singularity structure of the quantum momentum function, until now used only for obtaining the bound state energies, one can straightforwardly find both the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions. After demonstrating the working of this approach through a number of solvable examples, we consider Hamiltonians, which exhibit broken and unbroken phases of supersymmetry. The natural emergence of the eigenspectra and the wave functions, in both the unbroken and the algebraically non-trivial broken phase, demonstrates the utility of this formalism.

abstract: Assuming the condition of no superluminal signalling, we got an upper bound on the quality of all asymmetric $ 1\to 2$ cloning machines, acting on qubits whose Bloch vectors lie on a great circle. Then we constructed an $ 1\to 2$ cloning machine, which asymmetrically clone all qubits corresponding to this great circle, and this machine matches with that upper bound, and hence this is optimal one.

The main tools are the coding theorem for classical-quantum constrained channels and a finite dimensional approximation of the input density operators for entanglement-assisted capacity. The new version contains improved formulation of sufficient conditions under which suprema in the capacity formulas are attained.

abstract: Recent discovery by Perutz et al. of the physical structure of the amyloid that accumulates in neurons in certain neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease, suggests novel mechanism of consciousness impairment, different from the neuronal loss, which is the end stage of the pathogenic process. Amyloid is shown to be water-filled nanotubes made of polymerized pathologically-changed proteins. It is hypothesized that the water inside the new-formed nanotubes can manifest optical coherent laser-like excitations and superradiance similarly to the processes taking part in the normal brain microtubules as shown by Jibu et al. The interfering with the macroscopic quantum effects within the normal microtubules can lead to impairment of conscious experience. Experimental data in favor of quantum theory of consciousness can be obtained from the research of the amyloid nanotubes.

abstract: Quantum superpositions can be used for parallel information processing, but only if protected against decoherence. A two-particle four-state system may have two-dimensional subspaces that are partially or completely decoherence-free, e.g., the symmetric triplet state as an example of the former, the anti-symmetric singlet state of the latter. By extension, a multiparticle system that in the laboratory basis is plagued by decoherence may in some other basis exhibit the symmetries that yield such decoherence-free subspaces (DFS's). Fully-interacting many-fermion spin 1/2 networks may be mathematically transformed to a more tractable many-to-one (or -to-some) variant. This paper applies such a transformation to a hypothetical network of boson-like operators and then argues that a fully-interacting particle number-preserving network of bosons plus fermions with supersymmetric degrees of freedom may be more plausibly exploited so as to contain DFS's. Physical systems that in some basis are inherently anti-symmetric are already known to be useful for quantum information processing. Supersymmetric systems may be likewise.

The entire procedure requires only the use of passive optical elements and photon detectors that solely distinguish between the presence and absence of photons.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211174
abstract: We investigate the complexity of sorting in the model of sequential quantum circuits. While it is known that in general a quantum algorithm based on comparisons alone cannot outperform classical sorting algorithms by more than a constant factor in time complexity, this is wrong in a space bounded setting. We observe that for all storage bounds n/\log n\ge S\ge \log^3 n, one can devise a quantum algorithm that sorts n numbers (using comparisons only) in time T=O(n^{3/2}\log^{3/2} n/\sqrt S). We then show the following lower bound on the time-space tradeoff for sorting $n$ numbers from a polynomial size range in a general sorting algorithm (not necessarily based on comparisons): TS=\Omega(n^{3/2}). Hence for small values of S the upper bound is almost tight. Classically the time-space tradeoff for sorting is TS=\Theta(n^2).

abstract: In this article initial steps in an analysis of cyclic networks of quantum logic gates is given. Cyclic networks are those in which the qubit lines are loops. Here we have studied one and two qubit systems plus two qubit cyclic systems connected to another qubit on an acyclic line. The analysis includes the group classification of networks and studies of the dynamics of the qubits in the cyclic network and of the perturbation effects of an acyclic qubit acting on a cyclic network. This is followed by a discussion of quantum algorithms and quantum information processing with cyclic networks of quantum gates, and a novel implementation of a cyclic network quantum memory. Quantum sensors via cyclic networks are also discussed.

We study the force as a function of the distance for gold and potassium spheres, which are over a substrate of titanium dioxide, sapphire and a perfect conductor. We show that Casimir force is important in systems at the nanometer scale. We study the force as a function of the material properties, radii of the spheres, and the distance between the sphere and the substrate.

abstract: We formulate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) gedankenexperiment within the framework of relativistic quantum theory to analyze a situation in which measurements are performed by moving observers. We point out that under certain conditions the perfect anti-correlation of an EPR pair of spins in the same direction is deteriorated in the moving observers' frame due to the Wigner rotation, and show that the degree of the violation of Bell's inequality prima facie decreases with increasing the velocity of the observers if the directions of the measurement are fixed. However, this does not imply a breakdown of non-local correlation since the perfect anti-correlation is maintained in appropriately chosen different directions. We must take account of this relativistic effect in utilizing in moving frames the EPR correlation and the violation of Bell's inequality for quantum communication.

abstract: We present an optical "enantio-selective switch", that, in two steps, turns a ("racemic") mixture of left-handed and right-handed chiral molecules into the enantiomerically pure state of interest. The optical switch is composed of an "enantio-discriminator" and an "enantio-converter" acting in tandem. The method is robust, insensitive to decay processes, and does not require molecular preorientation. We demonstrate the method on the purification of a racemate of (transiently chiral) D$_2$S$_2$ molecules, performed on the nanosecond timescale.

Our proof makes use of the degree of a representing polynomial over the finite field of size p^k. We show a linear lower bound on the degree of this polynomial. We also show an upper bound of O(n^{1/log_p m}) on the degree over the ring of integers modulo m, whenever m is a squarefree composite with largest prime factor p.

The standard axioms of quantum mechanics are re-interpreted. Our aim is to show that, when formulated in the language of quantum real numbers, the laws of quantum mechanics appear more natural, less counterintuitive than when they are presented in terms of standard numbers.

abstract: A general semiclassical approach to quantum systems with system-bath interactions is developed. We study system decoherence in detail using a coherent state semiclassical wavepacket method which avoids singularity issues arising in the usual Green's function approach. We discuss the general conditions under which it is approximately correct to discuss quantum decoherence in terms of a ``dephasing'' picture and we derive semiclassical expressions for the phase and phase distribution. Remarkably, an effective system wavefunction emerges whose norm measures the decoherence and is equivalent to a density matrix formulation.

In particular, we develop two representative two-qudit hybrid gates (SUM and SWAP) and many-qudit hybrid Toffoli and Fredkin gates. We apply the hybrid SUM gate to generating entanglement, and find that operator entanglement of the SUM gate is equal to the entanglement generated by it for certain initial states. We also show that the hybrid SUM gate acts as an automorphism on the Pauli group for two qudits of different dimension under certain conditions. Finally, we describe a physical realization of these hybrid gates for spin systems.

abstract: In general, a quantum algorithm wants to avoid decoherence or perturbation, since such factors may cause errors in the algorithm. In this letter, we will supply the answer to the interesting question: can the factors seemingly harmful to a quantum algorithm(for example, perturbations) enhance the algorithm? We show that some perturbations to the generalized quantum search Hamiltonian can reduce the running time and enhance the success probability. We also provide the narrow bound to the perturbation which can be beneficial to quantum search. In addition, we show that the error induced by a perturbation on the Farhi and Gutmann Hamiltonian can be corrected by another perturbation.

abstract: Uhlmann's mixed state geometric phase [Rep. Math. Phys. {\bf 24}, 229 (1986)] is analyzed in the case of a qubit affected by isotropic decoherence treated in the Markovian approximation. It is demonstrated that this phase decreases rapidly with increasing decoherence rate and that it is most fragile to weak decoherence for pure or nearly pure initial states. In the unitary case, we compare Uhlmann's geometric phase for mixed states with that occurring in standard Mach-Zehnder interferometry [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 2845 (2000)] and show that the latter is more robust to reduction in the length of the Bloch vector. We also describe how Uhlmann's geometric phase in the present case could in principle be realized experimentally.

abstract: Several authors have recently claimed that Bell's inequalities (BI) do not apply to certain types of generalized local hidden variables (HV) models. These claims are rejected, by means of a proof of BI valid for a very broad class of local HV models (deterministic or stochastic, with or without memory, time dependent or time independent, setting dependent or setting independent, and even allowing classical communication between the wings of the experiment). The precise meaning of the locality requirement is clarified during the proof. The exact roles of the two assumptions that amount to Bell's locality (parameter independence and outcome independence) are explicitly shown, using each one of them in a different step of the proof. using each one of them in a different step of the proof.

abstract: In the qubit semantics the \emph{meaning} of any sentence $\alpha$ is represented by a \emph{quregister}: a unit vector of the $n$--fold tensor product $\otimes^n \C^2$, where $n$ depends on the number of occurrences of atomic sentences in $\alpha$. The logic characterized by this semantics, called {\it quantum computational logic} (QCL), is {\it unsharp}, because the non-contradiction principle is violated. We show that QCL does not admit any logical truth. In this framework, any sentence $\alpha$ gives rise to a \emph{quantum tree}, consisting of a sequence of unitary operators. The quantum tree of $\alpha$ can be regarded as a quantum circuit that transforms the quregister associated to the atomic subformulas of $\alpha$ into the quregster associated to $\alpha$.

Although this process is well understood, the phase shifts induced by this diffraction process are not well known. In this paper, we make analytic calculations of these phase shifts in some simple cases and we use these results to model the contrast interferometer recently built by the group of D. Pritchard at MIT. We thus show that the values of the diffraction phases are large and that they probably contribute to the phase noise observed in this experiment.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Recently, general point interactions in one dimension has been used to model a large number of different phenomena in quantum mechanics. Such potentials, however, requires some sort of regularization to lead to meaningful results. The usual ways to do so rely on technicalities which may hide important physical aspects of the problem. In this work we present a new method to calculate the exact Green functions for general point interactions in 1D. Our approach differs from previous ones because it is based only on physical quantities, namely, the scattering coefficients, $R$ and $T$, to construct $G$. Renormalization or particular mathematical prescriptions are not invoked. The simple formulation of the method makes it easy to extend to more general contexts, such as for lattices of $N$ general point interactions; on a line; on a half-line; under periodic boundary conditions; and confined in a box.

abstract: Various notions from geometric control theory are used to characterize the behavior of the Markovian master equation for N-level quantum mechanical systems driven by unitary control and to describe the structure of the sets of reachable states. It is shown that the system can be accessible but neither small-time controllable nor controllable in finite time. In particular, if the generators of quantum dynamical semigroups are unital, then the reachable sets admit easy characterizations as they monotonically grow in time. The two level case is treated in detail.

abstract: We present a relativistic quantum calculation at first order in perturbation theory of the differential cross section for a Dirac particle scattered by a solenoidal magnetic field. The resulting cross section is symmetric in the scattering angle as those obtained by Aharonov and Bohm (AB) in the string limit and by Landau and Lifshitz (LL) for the non relativistic case. We show that taking pr_0\|sin(\theta/2)|/\hbar<<1 in our expression of the differential cross section it reduces to the one reported by AB, and if additionally we assume \theta << 1 our result becomes the one obtained by LL. However, these limits are explicitly singular in \hbar as opposed to our initial result. We analyze the singular behavior in \hbar and show that the perturbative Planck's limit (\hbar -> 0) is consistent, contrarily to those of the AB and LL expressions. We also discuss the scattering in a uniform and constant magnetic field, which resembles some features of QCD.

By using a superoperatorial approach we succeed in deriving the operatorial solution for the density matrix of the system. Our method is independent of the physical properties of the environment. We show the usefulness of our solution deriving explicit expressions for the dissipative time evolution of some observables of physical interest for the system, such as, for example, its mean energy.

abstract: Exceptional points and double poles of the S matrix are both characterized by the coalescence of a pair of eigenvalues. In the first case, the coalescence causes a defect of the Hilbert space. In the second case, this is not so as shown in prevoius papers. Mathematically, the reason for this difference is the bi-orthogonality of the eigenfunctions of a non-Hermitian operator that is ignored in the first case. The consequences for the topological structure of the Hilbert space are studied and compared with existing experimental data.

The bound applies even to systems performing a quantum computation within a decoherence-free subspace, but might be optimized by the use of non-equilibrium squeezed states of the environment, or by using an environment system constructed to have response confined to certain frequencies.

abstract: We formulate general conditions necessary for a linear-response detector to reach the quantum limit of measurement efficiency, where the measurement-induced dephasing rate takes on its minimum possible value. These conditions are applicable to both non-interacting and interacting systems. We assess the status of these requirements in an arbitrary non-interacting scattering based detector, identifying the symmetries of the scattering matrix needed to reach the quantum limit. We show that these conditions are necessary to prevent the existence of information in the detector which is not extracted in the measurement process.

abstract: We propose to subject two Bose-Einstein condensates to a periodic potential, so that one condensate undergoes the Mott insulator transition to a state with precisely one atom per lattice site. We show that photoassociation of heteronuclear molecules within each lattice site is described by the quantum optical Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. In analogy with studies of this Hamiltonian with cavity fields and trapped ions, we are thus able to engineer quantum optical states of atomic matter wave fields and we are able to reconstruct these states by quantum state tomography.

abstract: We propose a model for spectral diffusion of localized spins in semiconductors due to the dipolar fluctuations of lattice nuclear spins. Each nuclear spin flip-flop is assumed to be independent, the rate for this process being calculated by a method of moments. Our calculated spin decoherence time $T_{M}=0.64$ ms for donor electron spins in Si:P is a factor of two longer than spin echo decay measurements. For $^{31}$P nuclear spins we show that spectral diffusion is well into the motional narrowing regime. The calculation for GaAs quantum dots gives $T_{M}=10-50$ $\mu$s depending on the quantum dot size. Our theory indicates that nuclear induced spectral diffusion should not be a serious problem in developing spin-based semiconductor quantum computer architectures.

abstract: The Bayesian formalism for a continuous measurement of solid-state qubits is derived for a model which takes into account several factors of the detector nonideality. In particular, we consider additional classical output and backaction noises (with finite correlation), together with quantum-limited output and backaction noises, and take into account possible asymmetry of the detector coupling. The formalism is first derived for a single qubit and then generalized to the measurement of entangled qubits.

abstract: We discuss the relaxation and dephasing rates that result from the control and the measurement setup itself in experiments on Josephson persistent-current qubits. For control and measurement of the qubit state, the qubit is inductively coupled to electromagnetic circuitry. We show how this system can be mapped on the spin-boson model, and how the spectral density of the bosonic bath can be derived from the electromagnetic impedance that is coupled to the qubit. Part of the electromagnetic environment is a measurement apparatus (DC-SQUID), that is permanently coupled to the single quantum system that is studied. Since there is an obvious conflict between long coherence times and an efficient measurement scheme, the measurement process is analyzed in detail for different measurement schemes. We show, that the coupling of the measurement apparatus to the qubit can be controlled in situ. Parameters that can be realized in experiments today are used for a quantitative evaluation, and it is shown that the relaxation and dephasing rates that are induced by the measurement setup can be made low enough for a time-resolved study of the quantum dynamics of Josephson persistent-current qubits. Our results can be generalized as engineering rules for the read-out of related qubit systems.

abstract: A semiconductor based scheme has been proposed for generating entangled photon pairs from the radiative decay of an electrically-pumped biexciton in a quantum dot. Symmetric dots produce polarisation entanglement, but experimentally-realised asymmetric dots produce photons entangled in both polarisation and frequency. In this work, we investigate the possibility of erasing the `which-path' information contained in the frequencies of the photons produced by asymmetric quantum dots to recover polarisation-entangled photons. We consider a biexciton with non-degenerate intermediate excitonic states in a leaky optical cavity with pairs of degenerate cavity modes close to the non-degenerate exciton transition frequencies. An open quantum system approach is used to compute the polarisation entanglement of the two-photon state after it escapes from the cavity, measured by the visibility of two-photon interference fringes. We explicitly relate the two-photon visibility to the degree of Bell-inequality violation, deriving a threshold at which Bell-inequality violations will be observed. Our results show that an ideal cavity will produce maximally polarisation-entangled photon pairs, and even a non-ideal cavity will produce partially entangled photon pairs capable of violating a Bell-inequality.

abstract: It has been proposed by Bekenstein and others that the horizon area of a black hole conforms, upon quantization, to a discrete and uniformly spaced spectrum. In this paper, we consider the area spectrum for the highly non-trivial case of a rotating (Kerr) black hole solution. Following a prior work by Barvinsky, Das and Kunstatter, we are able to express the area spectrum in terms of an integer-valued quantum number and an angular-momentum operator. Moreover, by using an analogy between the Kerr black hole and a quantum rotator, we are able to quantize the angular-momentum sector. We find the area spectrum to be $A_{n,J_{cl}}=8\pi\hbar(n+J_{cl}+1/2)$, where $n$ and $J_{cl}$ are both integers. The quantum number $J_{cl}$ is related to but distinct from the eigenvalue $j$ of the angular momentum of the black hole. Actually, it represents the ``classical'' angular momentum and, for $J_{cl}\gg 1$, $J_{cl}\approx j$.

abstract: The usual renormalization procedure for the variational approximation with a trial Gaussian ansatz for the $\lap$ model in 3+1 dimensions is re-analysed as a departing framework for the investigation of the parameters of the model. The so-called asymmetric phase of the model (where $<vac|\phi |vac> \neq 0$) is considered for the search of privileged values of these parameters (mass and coupling constant) and possible conditions they may be expected to satisfy. This also may yield a suitable approach for the investigation of the reliability and stability of the approximation. The extremization of the renormalized energy density with relation to the renormalized mass, coupling and $\bphi$ is done. The minimizations of the renormalized energy with relation to the mass and $\bphi$ provide different expressions from the ones obtained by the usual variational procedure for the regularized theory. Sort of ``energy scale'' invariances in expressions for the renormalized mass and coupling constant are found. A different view on the restoration of symmetry issue is discussed. The transcendental character of the GAP equation may be reduced or even eliminated by placing some variables in the complex plane.

abstract: We give a geometrical derivation of the Dirac equation by considering a spin-1/2 particle travelling with the speed of light in a cubic spacetime lattice. The mass of the particle acts to flip the multi-component wavefunction at the lattice sites. Starting with a difference equation for the case of one spatial and one time dimensions, we generalize the approach to higher dimensions. Interactions with external electromagnetic and gravitational fields are also considered. One logical interpretation is that only at the lattice sites is the spin-1/2 particle aware of its mass and the presence of external fields.

We find the effective action of the time-dependent systems and show that many aspects of the dynamics are independent of the details of time evolution, e.g., the squeezing of the wave-function is determined by the effective potential of the final stage of time-evolution.

abstract: In the q-deformed theory the perturbation approach can be expressed in terms of two pairs of undeformed position and momentum operators. There are two configuration spaces. Correspondingly there are two q-perturbation Hamiltonians, one originates from the perturbation expansion of the potential in one configuration space, the other one originates from the perturbation expansion of the kinetic energy in another configuration space. In order to establish a general foundation of the q-perturbation theory, two perturbation equivalence theorems are proved: (I) Equivalence theorem {\it I}: Perturbation expressions of the q-deformed uncertainty relations calculated by two pairs of undeformed operators are the same, and the two q-deformed uncertainty relations undercut Heisenberg's minimal one in the same style. (II) The general equivalence theorem {\it II}: for {\it any} potential (regular or singular) the expectation values of two q-perturbation Hamiltonians in the eigenstates of the undeformed Hamiltonian are equivalent to all orders of the perturbation expansion. As an example of singular potentials the perturbation energy spectra of the q-deformed Coulomb potential are studied.

abstract: We define the "maximally integrable" isotropic oscillator on CP(N) and discuss its various properties, in particular, the behaviour of the system with respect to a constant magnetic field. We show that the properties of the oscillator on CP(N) qualitatively differ in the N>1 and N=1 cases. In the former case we construct the ``axially symmetric'' system which is locally equivalent to the oscillator. We perform the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation of the oscillator on CP(2) and construct some generalized MIC-Kepler problem. We also define a N=2 superextension of the oscillator on CP(N) and show that for N>1 the inclusion of a constant magnetic field preserves the supersymmetry of the system.

abstract: Relations between two definitions of (total) angular momentum operator, as a generator of rotations and in the Lagrangian formalism, are explored in quantum field theory. Generally, these definitions result in different angular momentum operators, which are suitable for different purposes in the theory. From the spin and orbital angular momentum operators (in the Lagrangian formalism) are extracted additive terms which are conserved operators and whose sum is the total angular momentum operator.

It also furnishes some examples of Z$_{\lambda}$-graded uniform topological symmetry of type (1, 1, ..., 1) with topological invariants generalizing the Witten index.

A loading protocol is described that results in 10,000 atoms per lattice site. Rapid free evaporation leads to phase space densities of 1/150 within 50 msec. The resulting small, high density atomic clouds are very attractive for a number of experiments, including ultracold Rydberg atom physics.
