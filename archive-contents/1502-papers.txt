abstract: We consider restricted versions of ${\rm postBQP}$ where postselection probabilities can be efficiently calculated by classical or quantum computers. We show that such restricted ${\rm postBQP}$ classes are in ${\rm AWPP}(\subseteq{\rm PP}={\rm postBQP})$. This result suggests that postselecting an event with an exponentially small probability does not necessarily boost ${\rm BQP}$ to PP. The best upperbound of ${\rm BQP}$ is ${\rm AWPP}$, and therefore restricted ${\rm postBQP}$ classes are other examples of complexity classes "slightly above ${\rm BQP}$". In [C. M. Lee and J. Barrett, arXiv:1412.8671], it was shown that the computational capacity of a general probabilistic theory which satisfies the tomographic locality is in ${\rm AWPP}$. Our result therefore implies that quantum physics with restricted postselections is an example of a super quantum theory which seems to be outside of their general probabilistic theory but its computational capacity is also in ${\rm AWPP}$. Although it is physically natural to expect that such restricted ${\rm postBQP}$ classes are not equivalent to BQP, we show that ${\rm UP}\cap{\rm coUP}$, which is unlikely to be in BQP, is contained in the restricted ${\rm postBQP}$ classes. Finally, we also consider another restricted class of ${\rm postBQP}$, where the postselected probability depends only on the size of inputs. We show that this restricted version is contained in ${\rm APP}$, where ${\rm AWPP}\subseteq{\rm APP}\subseteq{\rm PP}={\rm postBQP}$.

abstract: In this paper we study the problem of a possibility to use quantum observables to describe a possible combination of the order effect with sequential reproducibility for quantum measurements. By the order effect we mean a dependence of probability distributions (of measurement results) on the order of measurements. We consider two types of the sequential reproducibility: adjacent reproducibility ($A-A$) and separated reproducibility($A-B-A$). The first one is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of measurement of some observable $A$ measured twice, one $A$ measurement after the other. The second one, $A-B-A$, is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of $A$ measurement when another quantum observable $B$ is measured between two $A$'s. Heuristically, it is clear that the second type of reproducibility is complementary to the order effect. We show that, surprisingly, for an important class of quantum observables given by positive operator valued measures (POVMs), this may not be the case. The order effect can coexist with a separated reproducibility as well as adjacent reproducibility for both observables $A$ and $B.$ However, the additional constraint in the form of separated reproducibility of the $B-A-B$ type makes this coexistence impossible. Mathematically, this paper is about the operator algebra for effects composing POVMs. The problem under consideration was motivated by attempts to apply the quantum formalism outside of physics, especially, in cognitive psychology and psychophysics. However, it is also important for foundations of quantum physics as a part of the problem about the structure of sequential quantum measurements.

abstract: In this chapter we will discuss the technology and experimental techniques to realize quantum dot (QD) single photon sources combining high outcoupling efficiencies and highest degrees of non-postselected photon indistinguishability. The system, which is based on ultra low density InAs QDs embedded in a quasi planar single sided microcavity with natural photonic traps is an ideal testbed to study quantum light emission from single QDs. We will discuss the influence of the excitation conditions on the purity of the single photon emission, and in particular on the degree of indistinguishability of the emitted photons. While high purity triggered emission of single photons is observed under all tested excitation conditions, single photon interference effects can be almost vanish in experiments relying on non-resonant pumping into the quantum dot wetting layer. In contrast, we can observe nearly perfect indistinguishability of single photons in resonance fluorescence excitation conditions, which underlines the superiority of this excitation scheme to create photon wave packets close to the Fourier limit. As a first step towards the realization of solid state quantum networks based on quantum dot single photon sources we test the overlap of photons emitted from remote QDs yielding non-postselected interference visibilities on the order of ~40% for quasi resonant excitation.

abstract: The last two decades have witnessed a rapid development of quantum information processing, a new paradigm which studies the power and limit of "quantum advantages" in various information processing tasks. Problems such as when quantum advantage exists, and if existing, how much it could be, are at a central position of these studies. In a broad class of scenarios, there are, implicitly or explicitly, at least two parties involved, who share a state, and the correlation in this shared state is the key factor to the efficiency under concern. In these scenarios, the shared \emph{entanglement} or \emph{discord} is usually what accounts for quantum advantage. In this paper, we examine a fundamental problem of this nature from the perspective of game theory, a branch of applied mathematics studying selfish behaviors of two or more players. We exhibit a natural zero-sum game, in which the chance for any player to win the game depends only on the ending correlation. We show that in a certain classical equilibrium, a situation in which no player can further increase her payoff by any local classical operation, whoever first uses a quantum computer has a big advantage over its classical opponent. The equilibrium is fair to both players and, as a shared correlation, it does not contain any discord, yet a quantum advantage still exists. This indicates that at least in game theory, the previous notion of discord as a measure of non-classical correlation needs to be reexamined, when there are two players with different objectives.

abstract: Quantum mechanics owes its name to the fact that certain physical quantities, like the energy of a hydrogen atom or the spin of an electron, are discrete. But even more distinctive is the existence of coherent superpositions, which provide an invaluable resource for quantum information processing and quantum technologies. The characterization, quantification, and manipulation of this resource are currently the object of intense research and are expected to contribute to the design of new high-performance quantum devices. In this paper we address the search for the best evolution that converts a given quantum superposition of energy eigenstates into another without exchang- ing energy with the surrounding environment. We consider both deterministic and probabilistic evolutions, obtained by measuring the environment and postselecting a subset of the outcomes. In both cases, we characterize the process that maximizes the fidelity with the target superposition. This characterization is used to design a branching sequence of probabilistic filters that increase the probability of success while reaching maximum fidelity at each iteration. We then show that a coherent superposition of different histories generated by such branching allows one to construct efficient approximations of the optimal fidelity-probability tradeoff, via a technique dubbed coherent coarse-graining. The benefits of our construction are illustrated in a number of applications to phase estimation, quantum cloning, coherent state amplification, and ancilla-driven computation.

abstract: This paper is concerned with the Coherent Quantum Linear Quadratic Gaussian (CQLQG) control problem of finding a stabilizing measurement-free quantum controller for a quantum plant so as to minimize an infinite-horizon mean square performance index for the fully quantum closed-loop system. In comparison with the observation-actuation structure of classical controllers, the coherent quantum feedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics and quantum information. Both the plant and the controller are open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must satisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions, which are organised as quadratic constraints on the controller matrices and reflect the preservation of CCRs in time. The CQLQG problem is a constrained optimization problem for the steady-state quantum covariance matrix of the plant-controller system satisfying an algebraic Lyapunov equation. We propose a gradient descent algorithm equipped with adaptive stepsize selection for the numerical solution of the problem. The algorithm finds a local minimum of the LQG cost over the parameters of the Hamiltonian and coupling operators of a stabilizing PR quantum controller, thus taking the PR constraints into account. A convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. A numerical example of a locally optimal CQLQG controller design is provided to demonstrate the algorithm performance.

abstract: We introduce the Green's functions technique as an alternative theory to the quantum regression theorem formalism for calculating the two-time correlation functions in open quantum systems. In particular, we investigate the potential of this theoretical approach by its application to compute the emission spectrum of a dissipative system composed by a single quantum dot inside of a semiconductor cavity. We also describe a simple algorithm based on the Green's functions technique for calculating the emission spectrum of the quantum dot as well as of the cavity which can easily be implemented in any numerical linear algebra package. We find that the Green's functions technique demonstrates a better accuracy and efficiency in the calculation of the emission spectrum and it allows to overcome the inherent theoretical difficulties associated to the direct application of the quantum regression theorem approach.

abstract: For Doppler-broadened media operating under double-double electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions, we devise a scheme to control and reduce the probe-field group velocity at the center of the second transparency window. We derive numerical and approximate analytical solutions for the width of EIT windows and for the group velocities of the probe field at the two distinct transparency windows, and we show that the group velocities of the probe field can be lowered by judiciously choosing the physical parameters of the system. Our modeling enables us to identify three signal-field strength regimes (with a signal-field strength always higher than the probe-field strength), quantified by the Rabi frequency, for slowing the probe field. These three regimes correspond to a weak signal field, with the probe-field group velocity and transparency window width both smaller for the second window compared to the first window, a medium-strength signal field, with a probe-field group velocity smaller in the second window than in the first window but with larger transparency-window width for the second window, and the strong signal field, with both group velocity and transparency window width larger for the second window. Our scheme exploits the fact that the second transparency window is sensitive to a temperature-controlled signal-field nonlinearity, whereas the first transparency window is insensitive to this nonlinearity.

abstract: In the complex action theory whose path runs over not only past but also future we study a normalized matrix element of an operator $\hat{\cal O}$ defined in terms of the future state at the latest time $T_B$ and the past state at the earliest time $T_A$ with a proper inner product that makes normal a given Hamiltonian that is non-normal at first. We present a theorem that states that, provided that the operator $\hat{\cal O}$ is $Q$-Hermitian, i.e., Hermitian with regard to the proper inner product, the normalized matrix element becomes real and time-develops under a $Q$-Hermitian Hamiltonian for the past and future states selected such that the absolute value of the transition amplitude from the past state to the future state is maximized. Furthermore, we give a possible procedure to formulate the $Q$-Hermitian Hamiltonian in terms of $Q$-Hermitian coordinate and momentum operators, and construct a conserved probability current density.

However, direct experimental evidence or observation to demonstrate the existence of noncommutative phase space is still lacking.We study a quantum ring in noncommutative phase space based on the Seiberg-Witten map and give the effective magnetic potential and field coming from the noncommutative phase space, which induces the persistent current in the ring. We introduce two variables as two signatures to detect the noncommutative phase space and propose an experimental scheme to detect the noncommutative phase space as long as we measure the persistent current and the external magnetic flux.

abstract: The symmetries associated with discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) and the flexibilities in controlling their dynamical parameters allow to create a large number of topological phases. An interface in position space, which separates two regions with different topological numbers, can, for example, be effectively modelled using different coin parameters for the walk on either side of the interface. Depending on the neighbouring numbers, this can lead to localized states in one-dimensional configurations and here we carry out a detailed study into the strength of such localized states. We show that it can be related to the amount of entanglement created by the walks, with minima appearing for strong localizations. This feature also persists in the presence of small amounts of $\sigma_x$ (bit flip) noise.

abstract: The quantum Szilard engine (QSZE) is a conceptual quantum engine for understanding the fundamental physics of quantum thermodynamics and information physics. We generalize the QSZE to an arbitrary spin case, i.e., a spin QSZE (SQSZE), and we systematically study the basic physical properties of both fermion and boson SQSZEs in a low-temperature approximation. We give the analytic formulation of the total work. For the fermion SQSZE, the work might be absorbed from the environment, and the change rate of the work with temperature exhibits periodicity and even-odd oscillation, which is a generalization of a spinless QSZE. It is interesting that the average absorbed work oscillates regularly and periodically in a large-number limit, which implies that the average absorbed work in a fermion SQSZE is neither an intensive quantity nor an extensive quantity. The phase diagrams of both fermion and boson SQSZEs give the SQSZE doing positive or negative work in the parameter space of the temperature and the particle number of the system, but they have different behaviors because the spin degrees of the fermion and the boson play different roles in their configuration states and corresponding statistical properties. The critical temperature of phase transition depends sensitively on the particle number. By using Landauer's erasure principle, we give the erasure work in a thermodynamic cycle, and we define an efficiency (we refer to it as information-work efficiency) to measure the engine's ability of utilizing information to extract work. We also give the conditions under which the maximum extracted work and highest information-work efficiencies for fermion and boson SQSZEs can be achieved.

abstract: By studying the topological invariance andBerry phase in non-Hermitian systems, we reveal the basic properties of the complex Berry phase and generalize the global Berry phases Q to identify the topological invariance for non-Hermitian systems.We find thatQcan identify topological invariance in two kinds of non-Hermitian model, the two-level non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the bipartite dissipative model. For the bipartite dissipative model, an abrupt change of the Berry phase in the parameter space reveals a quantum phase transition and is related to the exceptional points. These results give the basic relationships between the Berry phase and the quantum and topological phase transitions of non-Hermitian systems.

abstract: Ultracold atoms in an ultrahigh-finesse optical cavity are a powerful platform to produce spin squeezing since photon of cavity mode can induce nonlinear spin-spin interaction and thus generate a one-axis twisting Hamiltonian $H_{\text{OAT}}=qJ_{x}^{2}$, whose corresponding maximal squeezing factor scales as $N^{-2/3}$, where $N$ is the atomic number. On the contrary, for the other two-axis twisting Hamiltonian $H_{\text{TAT}}=q(J_{x}^{2}-J_{y}^{2})$, the maximal squeezing factor scales as $N^{-1}$, approaching the Heisenberg limit. In this paper, inspired by recent experiments of cavity-assisted Raman transitions, we propose a scheme, in which an ensemble of ultracold six-level atoms interacts with two quantized cavity fields and two pairs of Raman lasers, to realize a tunable two-axis spin Hamiltonian $%H=q(J_{x}^{2}+\chi J_{y}^{2})+\omega_{0}J_{z}$. For proper parameters, the above one- and two- axis twisting Hamiltonians are recovered, and the scaling of $N^{-1}$ of the maximal squeezing factor can occur naturally. On the other hand, in the two-axis twisting Hamiltonian, spin squeezing is usually reduced when increasing the effective atomic resonant frequency $\omega_{0}$. Surprisingly, we find that by combined with the dimensionless parameter $\chi(>-1)$, the effective atomic resonant frequency $\omega_{0}$ can enhance spin squeezing largely. These results are benefit for achieving the required spin squeezing in experiments.

abstract: In this work, the anisotropic quantum Rabi model with different coupling strengths of the rotating-wave and counter-rotating wave terms is studied by using two kinds of extended coherent states (ECS). By the first kind of ECS, we can derive a so-called $G$-function, by which both the regular and exceptional solutions can be given. The exceptional solution are just corresponding to the crossing points of two energy levels with different parities, so is doubly degenerate. By the second kind of ECS, a general scheme for the eigensolutions is derived analytically in a unified way. The zero-order approximation is just the adiabatic approximation, and the first-order approximation is actually a generalized rotating-wave approximation. The algebraic formulae for the eigensolutions are given explicitly in two approximations. The generalized rotating-wave approximations work well in a wide range of two different coupling strengths and the qubit detunings.

In this paper, we extended it to multipartite case. A general way of constructing $(m+1)$-partite UEBk from $m$-partite UEBk is proposed, $m\geq 2$. Consequently, we show that there are infinitely many UEBks in $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_2}\otimes...\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_N}$ with any dimensions and any $N\geq3$ by exploring the bipartite UEBks.

abstract: We investigate a quantum heat engine with a working substance of two particles, one with a spin-$1/2$ and the other with an arbitrary spin (spin-$s$), coupled by Heisenberg exchange interaction, and subject to an external magnetic field. The engine operates in a quantum Otto cycle. Work harvested in the cycle and its efficiency are calculated using quantum thermodynamical definitions. It is found that the engine has higher efficiencies at higher spin values and can harvest work at higher exchange interaction strengths.The role of exchange coupling and spin-$s$ on the work output and the thermal efficiency is studied in detail. In addition, the engine operation is analyzed from the perspective of local work and efficiency. The local work definition is generalized for the global changes and the conditions when the global work can be equal or more than the sum of the local works are determined.

abstract: Transport phenomena are one of the most challenging problems in computational physics. We present a quantum simulator based on pseudospin-boson quantum systems, which is suitable for encoding fluid dynamics problems within a lattice kinetic formalism. This quantum simulator is obtained by exploiting the analogies between Dirac and lattice Boltzmann equations. It is shown that both the streaming and collision processes of lattice Boltzmann dynamics can be implemented with controlled quantum operations, using a heralded quantum protocol to encode non-unitary scattering processes. The proposed simulator is amenable to realization in controlled quantum platforms, such as ion-trap quantum computers or circuit quantum electrodynamics processors.

abstract: Compressed sensing (CS) is a technique to faithfully estimate an unknown signal from relatively few data points when the measurement samples satisfy a restricted isometry property (RIP). Recently, this technique has been ported to quantum information science to perform tomography with a substantially reduced number of measurement settings. In this work we show that the constraint that a physical density matrix is positive semidefinite provides a rigorous connection between the RIP and the informational completeness of a POVM used for state tomography. This enables us to construct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise using tools provided by the CS methodology. The exact recovery no longer hinges on a particular convex optimization program; solving any optimization, constrained to the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, effectively results in a CS estimation of the state. From a practical point of view, we can therefore employ fast algorithms developed to handle large dimensional matrices for efficient tomography of quantum states of a large dimensional Hilbert space.

abstract: It is well known that the efficiency of linear optical implementations of the dense coding is limited by one's ability to discriminate between the four optically encoded Bell states. The best experimental demonstration up to date reports the transmission of $\approx$ 1.63 bits of information per single optical qubit which is less than the theoretical bound of 2.0 bits for a generic qubit. We show that besides the Bell states there is a class of bipartite two-photon entangled states that can also facilitate dense coding. However, in contrast to the Bell states, they can be deterministically discriminated by means of linear optics and coincidence photo detection without using any auxiliary entanglement resources. We discuss how the proposed dense coding scheme can be generalized to the case of two-photon $N$-mode entangled states for $N=6,8$.

abstract: We show how to use two-mode squeezed light to exponentially enhance cavity-based dispersive qubit measurement. Our scheme enables true Heisenberg-limited scaling of the measurement, and crucially, is not restricted to small dispersive couplings or unrealistically long measurement times. It involves coupling a qubit dispersively to two cavities, and making use of a symmetry in the dynamics of joint cavity quadratures (a so-called quantum-mechanics free subspace). We discuss the basic scaling of the scheme and its robustness against imperfections, as well as a realistic implementation in circuit quantum electrodynamics.

abstract: We use a microscopic model, the Mirror-Oscillator-Field (MOF) model proposed by Galley, Behunin and Hu [Phys. Rev. A 87, 043832 (2013)], to describe the quantum entanglement between a mirror's center of mass (CoM) motion and a field. In contrast with the conventional approach where the mirror-field entanglement is understood as arising from the radiation pressure of an optical field inducing the motion of the mirror's CoM, the MOF model incorporates the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom of the mirror that couple to the optical field directly. The major advantage in this approach is that it provides a self-consistent treatment of the three pertinent subsystems (the mirror's CoM motion, its internal degrees of freedom and the field) including their back-actions on each other, thereby giving a more accurate account of the quantum correlations between the individual subsystems. The optical and the mechanical properties of a mirror arising from its dynamical interaction with a quantum field are obtained without imposing any boundary conditions on the field additionally, as is done in the conventional way. As one of the new physical features that arise from this self-consistent treatment of the coupled optics and mechanics behavior we observe a coherent transfer of quantum correlations from the field to the mirror via its internal degrees of freedom. We find the quantum entanglement between the optical field and the mirror's center of mass motion upon coarse-graining over the internal degree of freedom. Further, we show that in certain parameter regimes the mirror-field entanglement is enhanced when the field interacts resonantly with the mirror's internal degree of freedom, a new result which highlights the importance of including the internal structure of the mirror in quantum optomechanical studies.

abstract: A quantum error correcting code is a subspace $\mathcal{C}$ such that allowed errors acting on any state in $\mathcal{C}$ can be corrected. A quantum code for which state recovery is only required up to a logical rotation within $\mathcal{C}$, can be used for detection of errors, but not for quantum error correction. Such a code with stabilizer structure, which we call an "ambiguous stabilizer code" (ASC), can nevertheless be useful for the characterization of quantum dynamics (CQD). The use of ASCs can help lower the size of CQD probe states used, but at the cost of increased number of operations.

abstract: In our previous work it has been shown the possibility to use the Aharonov-Anandan invariant as a tool in the analysis of disparate systems, including Hawking and Unruh effects, as well as graphene physics and thermal states. Here we analyze the properties of the Mukunda-Simon phase of a system undergoing a non-unitary evolution. In particular, we consider two level atoms accelerated by an external potential and interacting with a thermal state. We propose the realization of Mach-Zehnder interferometers which can prove the existence of the Unruh effect and can allow very precise measurement of temperature. Our discussion is quite general and applies to phenomena characterized by vacuum condensation processes.

abstract: This article was written for the Logic in Computer Science column in the February 2015 issue of the Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science. The intended audience is general computer science audience. The uncertainty principle asserts a limit to the precision with which position x and momentum p of a particle can be known simultaneously. You may know the probability distributions of x and p individually but the joint distribution makes no physical sense. Yet Wigner exhibited such a joint distribution f(x,p). There was, however, a little trouble with it: some of its values were negative. Nevertheless Wigner's discovery attracted attention and found applications. There are other joint distribution, all with negative values, which produce the correct marginal distributions of x and p. But only Wigner's distribution produces the correct marginal distributions for all linear combinations of position and momentum. We offer a simple proof of the uniqueness and discuss related issues.

abstract: Quantum mechanics establishes the ultimate limit to the scaling of the precision on any parameter, by iden- tifying optimal probe states and measurements. While this paradigm is, at least in principle, adequate for the metrology of quantum channels involving the estimation of phase and loss parameters, we show that estimat- ing the loss parameters associated with a quantum channel and a realistic quantum detector are fundamentally different. While Fock states are provably optimal for the former, we identify a crossover in the nature of the optimal probe state for estimating detector imperfections as a function of the loss parameter. We provide explicit results for on-off and homodyne detectors, the most widely used detectors in quantum photonics technologies.

abstract: The success of quantum optimal control for both experimental and theoretical objectives is connected to the topology of the corresponding control landscapes, which are free from local traps if three conditions are met: (1) the quantum system is controllable, (2) the Jacobian of the map from the control field to the evolution operator is of full rank, and (3) there are no constraints on the control field. This paper investigates how the violation of assumption (3) affects gradient searches for globally optimal control fields. The satisfaction of assumptions (1) and (2) ensures that the control landscape lacks fundamental traps, but certain control constraints can still introduce artificial traps. Proper management of these constraints is an issue of great practical importance for numerical simulations as well as optimization in the laboratory. Using optimal control simulations, we show that constraints on quantities such as the number of control variables, the control duration, and the field strength are potentially severe enough to prevent successful optimization of the objective. For each such constraint, we show that exceeding quantifiable limits can prevent gradient searches from reaching a globally optimal solution. These results demonstrate that careful choice of relevant control parameters helps to eliminate artificial traps and facilitate successful optimization.

abstract: Classical reversible circuits, acting on $w$~bits, are represented by permutation matrices of size $2^w \times 2^w$. Those matrices form the group P($2^w$), isomorphic to the symmetric group {\bf S}$_{2^w}$. The permutation group P($n$), isomorphic to {\bf S}$_n$, contains cycles with length~$p$, ranging from~1 to $L(n)$, where $L(n)$ is the so-called Landau function. By Lagrange interpolation between the $p$~matrices of the cycle, we step from a finite cyclic group of order~$p$ to a 1-dimensional Lie group, subgroup of the unitary group U($n$). As U($2^w$) is the group of all possible quantum circuits, acting on $w$~qubits, such interpolation is a natural way to step from classical computation to quantum computation.

abstract: It has been suggested that there may exist quantum correlations that go beyond entanglement. The existence of such correlations can be revealed by quantum discord, but not by the conventional measure of entanglement. We argue that a state displays quantumness that can be of local and nonlocal origin. The physical quantity such as the quantum discord probes not only the nonlocal quantumness but also the local quantumness, such as the "local superposition". This can be a reason why such measures are non-zero when there is no entanglement. We consider a generalized version of the Werner state to demonstrate the interplay of local quantumness, nonlocal quantumness, and classical mixedness of a state.

We hereby consider an open quantum micro-circuit, effectively describable as a two-level open quantum system, whose asymptotic current might be experimentally accessible. This latter could indeed be used to discriminate between its possible non-completely positive Redfield dynamics and a completely positive one obtained by standard weak-coupling limit techniques, at the same time verifying the fate of the second law of thermodynamics in such a context.

abstract: The design of Quantum Turbo Codes (QTCs) typically relies on the analysis of their distance spectra, followed by Monte-Carlo simulations. By contrast, in this paper we appropriately adapt the conventional non-binary EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts for quantum turbo codes by exploiting the intrinsic quantum-to-classical isomorphism. The EXIT chart analysis not only allows us to dispense with the time-consuming Monte-Carlo simulations, but also facilitates the design of near-capacity codes without resorting to the analysis of their distance spectra. We have demonstrated that our EXIT chart predictions are in line with the Monte-Carlo simulations results. We have also optimized the entanglement-assisted QTC using EXIT charts, which outperforms the existing distance spectra based QTCs. More explicitly, the performance of our optimized QTC is as close as 0.3 dB to the corresponding hashing bound.

The angular and radial dependence of the decay rate for different atomic polarizations of an excited atom and also of the energy level shifts are depicted and discussed. The consistency of the present approach in some limiting cases is investigated by comparing the relevant results obtained here to the previously reported results.

abstract: We study the structure of the phase diagram for systems consisting of 2- and 3- level particles dipolarly interacting with a 1-mode electromagnetic field, inside a cavity, paying particular attention to the case of a finite number of particles, and showing that the divergences that appear in other treatments are a consequence of the mathematical approximations employed and can be avoided by studying the system in an exact manner quantum-mechanically or via a catastrophe formalism with variational trial states that satisfy the symmetries of the appropriate Hamiltonians. These variational states give an excellent approximation not only to the exact quantum phase space, but also to the energy spectrum and the expectation values of the atomic and field operators. Furthermore, they allow for analytic expressions in many of the cases studied. We find the loci of the transitions in phase space from one phase to the other, and the order of the quantum phase transitions are determined explicitly for each of the configurations, with and without detuning. We also derive the critical exponents for the various systems, and the phase structure at the triple point present in the {\Xi}-configuration of 3-level systems is studied.

abstract: With quantum computers being out of reach for now, quantum simulators are the alternative devices for efficient and more exact simulation of problems that are challenging on conventional computers. Quantum simulators are classified into analog and digital, with the possibility of constructing "hybrid" simulators by combining both techniques. In this paper, we focus on analog quantum simulators of open quantum systems and address the limit that they can beat classical computers. In particular, as an example, we discuss simulation of the chlorosome light-harvesting antenna from green sulfur bacteria with over 250 phonon modes coupled to each electronic state. Furthermore, we propose physical setups that can be used to reproduce the quantum dynamics of a standard and multiple-mode Holstein model. The proposed scheme is based on currently available technology of superconducting circuits consist of flux qubits and quantum oscillators.

abstract: Recent theoretical and experimental developments in the field of electron vortex beam physics have raised questions on what exactly this novelty in the field of electron microscopy (and other fields, such as particle physics) really provides. An important part in the answer to those questions lies in scattering theory. The present investigation explores various aspects of inelastic quantum scattering theory for cylindrically symmetric beams with orbital angular momentum. The model system of Coulomb scattering on a hydrogen atom provides the setting to address various open questions: How is momentum transferred? Do vortex beams selectively excite atoms, and how can one employ vortex beams to detect magnetic transitions? The analytical approach presented here provides answers to these questions. OAM transfer is possible, but not through selective excitation; rather, by pre- and post-selection one can filter out the relevant contributions to a specific signal.

abstract: Recently, two quantifications for nonclassicality of a single-mode field are shown to be equivalent; (i) the rank of entanglement it can generate by a beam-splitter and (ii) the number of terms needed to expand it as superposition of coherent states. We show that nonclassicality criteria can be obtained with an alternative approach. The rank of two-mode entanglement among 2-level identical particles converges to the rank of single-mode nonclassicality within the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, at the large particle number limit. In particular, we show that the entanglement criterion of Hillery & Zubairy converges to the Mandel's $Q$-parameter which is used to reveal nonclassicality, and spin-squeezing criterion of S{\o}rensen et al. converges to single-mode squeezing condition. We obtain additional nonclassicality criteria not existing in the literature. We also discuss if single-mode nonclassicality can be visualized as the entanglement of space generating the photons. Moreover, in a forthcoming study we show that, linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity becomes noncausal above the critical coupling where output single-mode field becomes nonclassical.

abstract: Nonclassicality of a single-mode field is equivalent to the rank of two-mode entanglement this field generates at the output of a beam-splitter [Phys. Rev. A 89, 052302 (2014)]. We derive a measure for the nonclassicality of a single-mode field using the two-mode inseparability measure of Simon-Peres-Horodecki. Degree of the single-mode nonclassicality requires the knowledge of only $\langle \hat{a}^2\rangle$ and $\langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$. This condition/measure is both a necessary and sufficient condition for Gaussian single-mode states. We show that this measure increases with squeezing strength and display a jump at the critical coupling for a superradiant phase transition. Additionally, we derive a simple analytical condition, $|\langle \hat{a}^2\rangle|>\langle\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\rangle$, for nonclassicality from Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criterion. In a forthcoming study, we use the derived measure to show the following. Non-causal linear optical response of an optomechanical cavity emerges at the same critical cavity-mechanical coupling where output field becomes nonclassical.

abstract: This paper shows how the classical finite probability theory (with equiprobable outcomes) can be reinterpreted and recast as the quantum probability calculus of a pedagogical or "toy" model of quantum mechanics over sets (QM/sets). There have been four previous attempts to develop a quantum-like model with the base field of $\mathbb{C}$ replaced by $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, but they are all forced into a merely "modal" interpretation by requiring the brackets to take values in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ (1 = possible, 0 = impossible). But the usual QM brackets <{\psi}|{\phi}> give the "overlap" between states {\psi} and {\phi}, so for subsets S,T of U, the natural definition is $<S|T>=|S{\cap}T|$. This allows QM/sets to be developed with a full probability calculus that turns out to be the perfectly classical Laplace-Boole finite probability theory. The point is not to clarify finite probability theory but to elucidate quantum mechanics itself by seeing some of its quantum features (e.g., two-slit experiment) in a classical setting.

Our main tool is port-based teleportation. If the gap between quantum and classical communication complexity can grow arbitrarily large, the ratio of the quantum value to the classical value of the Bell quantity becomes unbounded with the increase in the number of inputs and outputs.

abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a promising system to build a solid state quantum network. A critical step in this area is to build an efficient interface between a stationary quantum bit and a flying one. In this chapter, we show how cavity quantum electrodynamics allows us to efficiently interface a single quantum dot with a propagating electromagnetic field. Beyond the well known Purcell factor, we discuss the various parameters that need to be optimized to build such an interface. We then review our recent progresses in terms of fabrication of bright sources of indistinguishable single photons, where a record brightness of 79% is obtained as well as a high degree of indistinguishability of the emitted photons. Symmetrically, optical nonlinearities at the very few photon level are demonstrated, by sending few photon pulses at a quantum dot-cavity device operating in the strong coupling regime. Perspectives and future challenges are briefly discussed.

abstract: Recent theoretical investigations on quantum coherent feedback networks have found that with the same pump power, the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR)-like entanglement generated via a dual nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) system placed in a certain coherent feedback loop is stronger than the EPR-like entangled pairs produced by a single NOPA. In this paper, we present a linear quantum system consisting of two NOPAs and a static linear passive network of optical devices. The network has six inputs and six outputs, among which four outputs and four inputs are connected in a coherent feedback loop with the two NOPAs. This passive network is represented by a $6 \times 6$ complex unitary matrix. A modified steepest descent method is used to find a passive complex unitary matrix at which the entanglement of this dual-NOPA network is locally maximized. Here we choose the matrix corresponding to a dual-NOPA coherent feedback network from our previous work as a starting point for the modified steepest descent algorithm. By decomposing the unitary matrix obtained by the algorithm as the product of so-called two-level unitary matrices, we find an optimized configuration in which the complex matrix is realized by a static optical network made of beam splitters.

abstract: Lorentz boosts on particles with spin and momentum degrees of freedom induce momentum-dependent rotations. Since, in general, different particles have different momenta, the transformation on the whole state is not a representation of the rotation group. Here we identify the group that acts on a two-particle system and, for the case when the momenta of the particles are correlated, find invariant subspaces that have interesting properties for quantum information processes in relativistic scenarios. A basis of states is proposed for the study of transformations of spin states under Lorentz boosts, which is a good candidate for building quantum communication protocols in relativistic scenarios.

The results offer a powerful tool to investigate the contextuality and to understand quantum information theory.

abstract: Although the foundations of quantum and classical physics are much different, it is often difficult to pinpoint which features of a particular system are intrinsically "quantum". Perhapse, the most clear-cut distinction between "classical" and "quantum" can be made for systems composed of many particles when the properties of the ensemble are determined by the correlations between the constituents. The issue of grasping the nature of entanglement (i.e. quantum correlations) lies in its formal, discriminative definition: "if state is not classical then it is entangled". A possible remedy would be to approach the problem from the utilitarian point of view. The idea is that certain tasks can be performed better when entangled states are used instead of states that are only classically correlated. An example of such task is an entanglement-enhanced interferometer utilizing ensembles of ultra-cold atoms. This line of reasoning leads to the concept of classification of entanglement by the degree of usefulness and allows to relate it to certain well-defined physical properties of the state. The aim of this work is to formalize this abstraction and build upon it an intuitive picture which can help us understand what the entanglement is.

abstract: The aim of this paper is to revisit the calculation of atom-surface quantum friction in the quantum field theory formulation put forward by Barton [New J. Phys. 12 (2010) 113045]. We show that the power dissipated into field excitations and the associated friction force depend on how the atom is boosted from being initially at rest to a configuration in which it is moving at constant velocity (v) parallel to the planar interface. In addition, we point out that there is a subtle cancellation between the one-photon and part of the two-photon dissipating power, resulting in a leading order contribution to the frictional power which goes as v^4. These results are also confirmed by an alternative calculation of the average radiation force, which scales as v^3.

In this context, laser-cooled atoms trapped in the evanescent field surrounding the optical nanofiber are of particular interest: They exhibit both long ground-state coherence times and efficient coupling to fiber-guided fields. Here, we demonstrate electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light, and the storage of fiber-guided optical pulses in an ensemble of cold atoms trapped in a nanofiber-based optical lattice. We measure a slow-down of light pulses to group velocities of 50 m/s. Moreover, we store optical pulses at the single photon level and retrieve them on demand in the fiber after 2 microseconds with an overall efficiency of (3.0 +/- 0.4) %. Our results show that nanofiber-based interfaces for cold atoms have great potential for the realization of building blocks for future optical quantum information networks.

abstract: Experimental Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols have to consist of not only the unconditionally secure quantum transmission, but also a subsequent classical exchange that enables key reconciliation and error correction. The details of the classical part of the protocol are often overlooked in favour of the more exciting quantum part. However the linking together of several secure protocols can unexpectedly leak information to an eavesdropper, even if the components are unconditionally secure in isolation. This oversight could be catastrophic as any secrecy gained during the quantum transmission can be easily and unknowingly lost during the classical one. In fact we show that in merely crossing the quantum-classical boundary some security is always lost. In this paper we examine how the local transfer between a state received quantumly to one processed classically can lower the secrecy of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD), even without any communication between parties. While this particular example applies to only CVQKD, it highlights the need to re-examine the way individual protocols are actually used.

abstract: Besides the conventional transverse couplings between superconducting qubits (SQs) and electromagnetic fields, there are additional longitudinal couplings when the inversion symmetry of the potential energies of the SQs is broken. We study nonclassical-state generation in a SQ which is driven by a classical field and coupled to a single-mode microwave field. We find that the classical field can induce transitions between two energy levels of the SQs, which either generate or annihilate, in a controllable way, different photon numbers of the cavity field. The effective Hamiltonians of these classical-field-assisted multiphoton processes of the single-mode cavity field are very similar to those for cold ions, confined to a coaxial RF-ion trap and driven by a classical field. We show that arbitrary superpositions of Fock states can be more efficiently generated using these controllable multiphoton transitions, in contrast to the single-photon resonant transition when there is only a SQ-field transverse coupling. The experimental feasibility for different SQs is also discussed.

abstract: The concept of an acoustical analog of the optical laser has been developed recently both in theoretical as well as experimental works. We discuss here a model of a coherent phonon generator with a direct signature of quantum properties of the sound vibrations. The considered setup is made of a laser driven quantum dot (QD) embedded in an acoustical nanocavity. The system's dynamics is solved for a single phonon mode in the steady-state and in the strong QD-phonon coupling regime beyond the secular approximation. We demonstrate that the phonon statistics exhibits quantum features, i.e. sub-Poissonian phonon statistics.

abstract: The relatively low key rate seems to be the major barrier to its practical use for the decoy state measurement device independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD). We present a method for the decoy-state MDIQKD that hugely raises the key rate. For example, it can raise the key rate of the recent Shanghai experiment by moreover than 600 times. Calculation shows that our method can be immediately applied for practical secure private communication with {\em fresh} secure keys generated from MDI-QKD.

abstract: For bipartite pure and mixed quantum states, in addition to the quantum mutual information, there is another measure of total correlation, namely, the entanglement of purification. We study the monogamy, polygamy, and additivity properties of the entanglement of purification for pure and mixed states. In this paper, we show that, in contrast to the quantum mutual information which is strictly monogamous for any tripartite pure states, the entanglement of purification is polygamous for the same. This shows that there can be genuinely two types of total correlation across any bipartite cross in a pure tripartite state. Furthermore, we find the lower bound and actual values of the entanglement of purification for different classes of tripartite and higher-dimensional bipartite mixed states. Thereafter, we show that if entanglement of purification is not additive on tensor product states, it is actually subadditive. Using these results, we identify some states which are additive on tensor products for entanglement of purification. The implications of these findings on the quantum advantage of dense coding are briefly discussed, whereby we show that for tripartite pure states, it is strictly monogamous and if it is nonadditive, then it is superadditive on tensor product states.

abstract: By incorporating the asymmetry of local protocols, i.e., some party has to start with a nontrivial measurement, into an operational method of detecting the local indistinguishability proposed by Horodecki {\it et al.} [Phys.Rev.Lett. 90 047902 (2003)], we derive a computable criterion to efficiently detect the local indistinguishability of maximally entangled states. Locally indistinguishable sets of $d$ maximally entangled states in a $d\otimes d$ system are systematically constructed for all $d\ge 4$ as an application. Furthermore, by exploiting the fact that local protocols are necessarily separable, we explicitly construct small sets of $k$ locally indistinguishable maximally entangled states with the ratio $k/d$ approaching 3/4. In particular, in a $d\otimes d$ system with even $d\ge 6$, there always exist $d-1$ maximally entangled states that are locally indistinguishable by separable measurements.

abstract: We show that single-mode nonclassicality of the output of an optomechanical cavity and the noncausal linear optical response of this cavity emerge at the same critical cavity-mechanical coupling. In other words, single-mode nonclassicality emerges when the barrier (in electromagnetism) avoiding faster-than-light communication is lifted off. The nature of the emergence of noncausal behavior does not depend on the length (boundary conditions) and the type of the cavity. Origin of the noncausal behavior is the temporal/frequency relations between the incident and reflected waves at the outer surface of the cavity. We further discuss the relations with the recent studies; (i) equivalence of the entanglement among identical particles to the nonclassicality of their quasiparticle excitations, (ii) necessity of superfluid behavior of vacuum, and (iii) entanglement-wormhole equivalence.

abstract: We report the experimental observation of slow-light and coherent storage in a setting where light is tightly confined in the transverse directions. By interfacing a tapered optical nanofiber with a cold atomic ensemble, electromagnetically induced transparency is observed and light pulses at the single-photon level are stored in and retrieved from the atomic medium with an overall efficiency of (10 +/- 0.5) %. Collapses and revivals can be additionally controlled by an applied magnetic field. Our results based on subdiffraction-limited optical mode interacting with atoms via the strong evanescent field demonstrate an alternative to free-space focusing and a novel capability for information storage in an all-fibered quantum network.

abstract: Establishing long-range quantum correlation is an integral part of several quantum information processing tasks. We consider a process to create quasi long-range quantum discord between the non-interacting end spins of a quantum spin chain, with the end spins weakly coupled to the bulk of the chain. We find that the process is not only capable of creating long-range quantum correlation but the latter remains frozen, when certain weak end-couplings are adiabatically varied, provided they are below certain thresholds. We term this phenomenon as adiabatic freezing of quantum correlation, which is robust to moderate thermal fluctuations. We also find that the energy gap of the system can remain frozen for the adiabatic variations. Moreover, considering the end spins as probes, we show that the freezing length can detect the anisotropy transition in quantum $XY$ spin chains.

abstract: In this paper, we analyze several critical issues in semi-device independent quantum information processing protocol. In practical experimental realization randomness generation in that scenario is possible only if the efficiency of the detectors used is above a certain threshold. Our analysis shows that the critical detection efficiency is 0.7071 in the symmetric setup, while in the asymmetric setup if one of the bases has perfect critical detection efficiency then the other one can be arbitrarily close to 0. We also analyze the semi-device independent random number generation efficiency based on different averages of guessing probability. To generate more randomness, the proper averaging method should be applied. Its choice depends on the value of a certain dimension witness. More importantly, the general analytical relationship between the maximal average guessing probability and dimension witness is given.

Specifically we observe for distinct driving frequencies a near depletion of certain sites which is explained by a resonant mixing of the involved Floquet-Bloch modes occurring at these frequencies. Our results could be exploited as a scheme for a site-selective loading of e.g. ultracold atoms into an optical lattices.

abstract: High-fidelity, efficient quantum nondemolition readout of quantum bits is integral to the goal of quantum computation. As superconducting circuits approach the requirements of scalable, universal fault tolerance, qubit readout must also meet the demand of simplicity to scale with growing system size. Here we propose a fast, high-fidelity, scalable measurement scheme based on the state-selective ring-up of a cavity followed by photodetection with the recently introduced Josephson photomultiplier (JPM), a current-biased Josephson junction. This scheme maps qubit state information to the binary digital output of the JPM, circumventing the need for room-temperature heterodyne detection and offering the possibility of a cryogenic interface to superconducting digital control circuitry. Numerics show that measurement contrast in excess of 95% is achievable in a measurement time of 140 ns. We discuss perspectives to scale this scheme to enable readout of multiple qubit channels with a single JPM.

abstract: The search for quantum coherence based on isolated atoms integrated with a room temperature solid state device (so-called atomchip [1-3]) has been intensifying in the last decade, with advances being made towards applications such as clocks, quantum information processing, surface probing and acceleration and gravitational field sensors. Such a device will also enable (and to some extent has already enabled) novel experiments in fundamental physics (e.g., [4-7]). Here we report on the trapping and maintenance of spatial coherence of atoms (in a Bose-Einstein Condensate -- BEC) about 5$\mu$m from a room temperature surface, reducing significantly the distance previously achieved between the spatially coherent atoms and their classical environment [8-12], and most importantly entering the regime where atomic circuits are enabled. In addition, we enter the interesting regime in which the distance to the surface is much smaller than the probed coherence length, a regime in which the spatial dephasing reaches its maximal rate.

abstract: The availability of quantum annealing devices with hundreds of qubits has made the experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup for optimization problems a coveted, albeit elusive goal. Going beyond earlier studies of random Ising problems, here we introduce a method to construct a set of frustrated Ising-model optimization problems with tunable hardness. We study the performance of a D-Wave Two device (DW2) with up to $503$ qubits on these problems and compare it to a suite of classical algorithms, including a highly optimized algorithm designed to compete directly with the DW2. The problems are generated around predetermined ground-state configurations, called planted solutions, which makes them particularly suitable for benchmarking purposes. The problem set exhibits properties familiar from constraint satisfaction (SAT) problems, such as a peak in the typical hardness of the problems, determined by a tunable clause density parameter. We bound the hardness regime where the DW2 device either does not or might exhibit a quantum speedup for our problem set. While we do not find evidence for a speedup for the hardest and most frustrated problems in our problem set, we cannot rule out that a speedup might exist for some of the easier, less frustrated problems. Our empirical findings pertain to the specific D-Wave processor and problem set we studied and leave open the possibility that future processors might exhibit a quantum speedup on the same problem set.

abstract: The photon statistics of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods nanocrystals is studied with a method involving post-selection of the photon detection events based on the photoluminescence count rate. We show that flickering between two states needs to be taken into account to interpret the single-photon emission properties. With post-selection we are able to identify two emitting states: the exciton and the charged exciton (trion), characterized by different lifetimes and different second order correlation functions. Measurements of the second order autocorrelation function at zero delay with post- selection shows a degradation of the single photon emission for CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods in a charged state that we explain by deriving the neutral and charged biexciton quantum yields.

abstract: Gaussian quantum states hold special importance in the continuous variable (CV) regime. In quantum information science, the understanding and characterization of central resources such as entanglement may strongly rely on the knowledge of the Gaussian or non-Gaussian character of the quantum state. However, the quantum measurement associated with the spectral photocurrent of light modes consists of a mixture of quadrature observables. Within the framework of two recent papers [Phys. Rev. A 88, 052113 (2013) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 200402 (2013)], we address here how the statistics of the spectral photocurrent relates to the character of the Wigner function describing those modes. We show that a Gaussian state can be misidentified as non-Gaussian and vice-versa, a conclusion that forces the adoption of tacit \textit{a priori} assumptions to perform quantum state reconstruction. We experimentally analyze the light beams generated by the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) operating above threshold to show that the data strongly supports the generation of Gaussian states of the field, validating the use of necessary and sufficient criteria to characterize entanglement in this system.

abstract: We introduce a multipartite extension of an information-theoretic distance first introduced in [Nature 341, 119 (1989)]. We use this new distance to derive entropic tests of multipartite nonlocality for three and for an arbitrary even number of qubits as well as a test of state-independent contextuality. In addition, we re-derive the tripartite Mermin inequality and a state-independent non-contextuality inequality by Cabello [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 210401 (2008)]. This suggests that the information-theoretic distance approach to multipartite nonlocality and state-independent contextuality can provide a more general treatment of nonclassical correlations than the orthodox approach based on correlation functions.

abstract: In this paper we explore the set of linear maps sending the set of quantum Gaussian states into itself. These maps are in general not positive, a feature which can be exploited as a test to check whether a given quantum state belongs to the convex hull of Gaussian states (if one of the considered maps sends it into a non positive operator, the above state is certified not to belong to the set). Generalizing a result known to be valid under the assumption of complete positivity, we provide a characterization of these Gaussian-to-Gaussian (not necessarily positive) superoperators in terms of their action on the characteristic function of the inputs. For the special case of one-mode mappings we also show that any Gaussian-to-Gaussian superoperator can be expressed as a concatenation of a phase-space dilatation, followed by the action of a completely positive Gaussian channel, possibly composed with a transposition. While a similar decomposition is shown to fail in the multi-mode scenario, we prove that it still holds at least under the further hypothesis of homogeneous action on the covariance matrix.

abstract: The characterization of the set of quantum correlations in Bell scenarios is a problem of paramount importance for both the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information processing in the device-independent scenario. We provide here simple and general analytical conditions that are necessary for an arbitrary bipartite behaviour to be quantum. Although the conditions are not sufficient, we illustrate the strength and non-triviality of these conditions with a few examples. Moreover, we provide several applications of this result: we prove the separation of the quantum set from extremal nonlocal no-signaling behaviours in several general scenarios, we provide a systematic construction to obtain Tsirelson bounds for arbitrary Bell inequalities and we construct a Bell expression whose maximal quantum value is attained by a maximally entangled state of qutrits.

abstract: We propose an all-optical approach for quantum erasure. Unwanted atom-light entanglement in spin squeezing is removed by destructive interference of three successive atom-light interaction process, with only the desired atom-atom interaction left. This scheme allows implementation of unitary one-axis and two-axis twisting spin squeezing using coherent light and cold or warm atomic ensemble. Calculations show that substantial spin squeezing is attainable under moderate experiment conditions. This proposal provides a new angle in using light to efficiently create many-body entanglement state with simple setups, and thus is promising for advancing technologies in quantum metrology and quantum information procession.

In each case the entanglement is tested using appropriate witnesses. We finally present generalizations of these ideas to three- and four-photon entangled states.

abstract: Position-based quantum cryptography (PBQC) allows a party to use its geographical location as its only credential to implement various cryptographic protocols. Such a protocol may lead to important applications in practice. Although it has been shown that any PBQC protocol is breakable if the adversaries pre-share an arbitrarily large entangled state, the security of PBQC in the bounded-quantum-storage model is still an open question. In this paper, we study the performance of various PBQC protocols over a lossy channel under the assumption that no entanglement is pre-shared between adversaries. By introducing the decoy state idea, we show that an extended BB84-type PBQC protocol implemented with a weak coherent source and realistic single photon detectors can tolerate an overall loss (including both the channel loss and the detection efficiency) of 13 dB if the intrinsic quantum bit error rate is 1%. We also study a few continuous variable PBQC protocols and show that they suffer from a 3 dB loss limitation.

abstract: Classical models of computation traditionally resort to halting schemes in order to enquire about the state of a computation. In such schemes, a computational process is responsible for signalling an end of a calculation by setting a halt bit, which needs to be systematically checked by an observer. The capacity of quantum computational models to operate on a superposition of states requires an alternative approach. From a quantum perspective, any measurement of an equivalent halt qubit would have the potential to inherently interfere with the computation by provoking a random collapse amongst the states. This issue is exacerbated by undecidable problems such as the \textit{Entscheidungsproblem} which require universal computational models, \textit{e.g.} the classical Turing machine, to be able to proceed indefinitely. In this work we present an alternative view of quantum computation based on production system theory in conjunction with Grover's amplitude amplification scheme that allows for (1) a detection of halt states without interfering with the final result of a computation; (2) the possibility of non-terminating computation and (3) an inherent speedup to occur during computations susceptible of parallelization. We discuss how such a strategy can be employed in order to simulate classical Turing machines.

We also apply semidefinite programming methods to obtain $N$-qubit X-states with maximal GM-concurrence for a given purity and to provide an alternative proof of optimality of a recently proposed set of density matrices for the role, the so-called X-MEMS. Furthermore, we introduce a numerical strategy to tailor a quantum operation that converts between any two given density matrices using a relatively small number of Kraus operators. We apply our strategy to design short operator-sum representations for the transformation between any given $N$-qubit mixed state and a corresponding X-MEMS of same purity.

abstract: The performance of a D-Wave Vesuvius quantum annealer was recently compared to a suite of classical algorithms on a class of constraint satisfaction instances based on frustrated loops. However, the construction of these instances leads the maximum coupling strength to increase with problem size. As a result, larger instances are subject to amplified analog control error, and are effectively annealed at higher temperatures in both hardware and software. We generate similar constraint satisfaction instances with limited range of coupling strength and perform a similar comparison to classical algorithms. On these instances the D-Wave Vesuvius processor, run with a fixed 20$\mu$s anneal time, shows a scaling advantage over the software solvers for the hardest regime studied. This scaling advantage opens the possibility of quantum speedup on these problems. Our results support the hypothesis that performance of D-Wave Vesuvius processors is heavily influenced by analog control error, which can be reduced and mitigated as the technology matures.

abstract: We clearly refine a fundamental framework for the thin-layer quantization scheme. Further, we definitively clarify a performing sequence in the thin-layer quantization process. The limit $q_3\to 0$ ($q_3$ denotes the variable perpendicular to the curved surface) must be performed after calculating all curvilinear coordinate derivatives. In the general form, a canonical action integral, the limit $d\to 0$ ($d$ is the thickness of the curved surface) has to be calculated after performing all curvilinear coordinate integrations. In complete accordance with the sequence, in the presence of an electromagnetic field, for a charged particle constrained on a spatially curved surface the Lorentz gauge and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation cannot be decoupled from the mean curvature of the surface simultaneously, except $A^3=0$ ($A^3$ is a contravariant component along the direction perpendicular to the curved surface of the electromagnetic field vector potential $\vec{A}$) with a certain gauge transformation, and the canonical action integral does not show convenience for the thin-layer quantization scheme. Additionally, we derive the modifications induced by the thickness of the surface to the geometric potential and the kinetic operator.

abstract: The generation of pseudo-random discrete probability distributions is of paramount importance for a wide range of stochastic simulations spanning from Monte Carlo methods to the random sampling of quantum states for investigations in quantum information science. In spite of its significance, a thorough exposition of such a procedure is lacking in the literature. In this article we present relevant details concerning the numerical implementation of what we call the normalization and trigonometric methods for generating an unbiased probability vector $\vec{p}=(p_{1},\cdots,p_{d})$. An immediate application of these results regarding the generation of pseudo-random pure quantum states is also described.

abstract: The quantum mechanical no-cloning theorem for pure states is generalized and transfered to the quantum logics with a onditional probability calculus. This is, on the one hand, an extension of the classical probability calculus and, on the other hand, a mathematical generalization of the Lueders - von Neumann quantum measurement process. In the non-classical case, a very special type of conditional probability emerges, describing the probability for the transition from a past event to a future event independently of any underlying state. This probability results from the algebraic structure of the quantum logic only and is invariant under algebraic morphisms, which is used to prove the generalized no-cloning theorem in a rather abstract, though simple and basic fashion without relying on a tensor product construction or finite dimension as required in other approaches.

abstract: While powerful tools have been developed to analyze quantum query complexity, there are still many natural problems that do not fit neatly into the black box model of oracles. We create a new model that allows multiple oracles with differing costs. This model captures more of the difficulty of certain natural problems. We test this model on a simple problem, Search with Two Oracles, for which we create a quantum algorithm that we prove is asymptotically optimal. We further give some evidence, using a geometric picture of Grover's algorithm, that our algorithm is exactly optimal.

abstract: Initially motivated by their relevance in foundations of quantum mechanics and more recently by their applications in different contexts of quantum information science, violations of Bell inequalities have been extensively studied during the last years. In particular, an important effort has been made in order to quantify such Bell violations. Probabilistic techniques have been heavily used in this context with two different purposes. First, to quantify how common the phenomenon of Bell violations is; and secondly, to find large Bell violations in order to better understand the possibilities and limitations of this phenomenon. However, the strong mathematical content of these results has discouraged some of the potentially interested readers. The aim of the present work is to review some of the recent results in this direction by focusing on the main ideas and removing most of the technical details, to make the previous study more accessible to a wide audience.

abstract: Practical BB84 quantum key distribution has been proposed by utilizing attenuated lasers combined with the decoy-state technique. However, there is a big gap in performance between asymptotic and finite-data settings due to statistical fluctuation. Here, we propose a four-intensity decoy-state protocol with three nonzero intensities in only one basis. Compared to conventional three-intensity decoy-state protocols, our protocol has an additional intensity as a free variable to optimize the deviations caused by statistical fluctuation. We perform numerical simulations with full optimization to make a comparison with the existing three-intensity decoy-state protocols with biased basis choice. According to the simulation result, larger maximum transmission distance and higher secure key rates can be achieved with our protocol. The performance of quantum key distribution is highly improved especially when the number of detected pulses is small. Our protocol might play a key role in the coming ground-satellite quantum key distribution.

abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has usually been demonstrated by using three-level atomic systems. In this paper, we theoretically proposed an efficient method to realize EIT in microwave regime through a coupled system consisting of a flux qubit and a superconducting LC resonator with relatively high quality factor. In the present composed system, the working levels are the dressed states of a two-level flux qubit and the resonators with a probe pump field. There exits a second order coherent transfer between the dressed states. By comparing the results with those in the conventional atomic system we have revealed the physical origin of the EIT phenomenon in this composed system. Since the whole system is artificial and tunable, our scheme may have potential applications in various domains.

abstract: We introduce an operational discord-type measure for quantifying nonclassical correlations in bipartite Gaussian states based on using Gaussian measurements. We refer to this measure as operational Gaussian discord (OGD). It is defined as the difference between the entropies of two conditional probability distributions associated to one subsystem, which are obtained by performing optimal local and joint Gaussian measurements. We demonstrate the operational significance of this measure in terms of a Gaussian quantum protocol for extracting maximal information about an encoded classical signal. As examples, we calculate OGD for several Gaussian states in the standard form.

abstract: The process algebra has been used successfully to provide a novel formulation of quantum mechanics in which non-relativistic quantum mechanics (NRQM) emerges as an effective theory asymptotically. The process algebra is applied here to the formulation of quantum field theory. The resulting QFT is intuitive, free from divergences and eliminates the distinction between particle, field and wave. There is a finite, discrete emergent space-time on which arise emergent entities which transfer information like discrete waves and interact with measurement processes like particles. The need for second quantization is eliminated and the particle and field theories rest on a common foundation, clarifying and simplifying the relationship between the two.

abstract: Previously (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys., v. 52, p. 082303 (2011)), the Dirac equation in an arbitrary electromagnetic field was shown to be generally equivalent to a fourth-order equation for just one component of the four-component Dirac spinor function. This was done for a specific (chiral) representation of gamma-matrices and for a specific component. In the current work, the result is generalized for a general representation of gamma-matrices and a general component (satisfying some conditions). The resulting equivalent of the Dirac equation is also much more symmetric than that of the previous work and should be useful in applications of the Dirac equation.

abstract: The Berry phase (BP) in a quantized light field demonstrated more than a decade ago (Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 220404) has attracted considerable attentions, since it plays an important role in the cavity quantum electrodynamics. However, it is argued in a recent paper ( Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 033601) that such a BP is just due to the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and the relevant BP should vanish beyond this approximation. Based on a consistent analysis we conclude in this letter that the BP in a generic Rabi model actually exists, no matter whether the RWA is applied. The existence of BP is also generalized to a three-level atom in the quantized cavity field.

abstract: Reconstruction of the dynamics (quantum process tomography) of the single-exciton manifold in energy transfer systems is proposed here on the basis of two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (2D-FS) with phase-modulation. The quantum-process-tomography protocol introduced here benefits from, e.g., the sensitivity enhancement ascribed to 2D-FS. Although the isotropically averaged spectroscopic signals depend on the quantum yield parameter $\Gamma$ of the doubly-excited-exciton manifold, it is shown that the reconstruction of the dynamics is insensitive to this parameter. Applications to foundational and applied problems, as well as further extensions, are discussed.

The $X$-states of the two qubits and the single qudit are considered in detail. A study of the relation of the obtained purity inequalities with the entanglement is presented.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02396
abstract: For continuous weak measurement of qubits, we obtain exact expressions for weak values (WVs) from the post-selection restricted average of measurement outputs, by using both the quantumtrajectory- equation (QTE) and quantum Bayesian approach. The former is applicable to short-time weak measurement, while the latter can relax the measurement strength to finite. We find that even in the "very" weak limit the result can be essentially different from the one originally proposed by Aharonov, Albert and Vaidman (AAV), in a sense that our result incorporates non-perturbative correction which could be important when the AAV's WV is large. Within the Bayesian framework, we obtain also elegant expressions for finite measurement strength and find that the amplifier's noise in quantum measurement has no effect on the WVs. In particular, we obtain very useful result for homodyne measurement in circuit-QED system, which allows for measuring the real and imaginary parts of the AAV's WV by simply tuning the phase of the local oscillator. This advantage can be exploited as efficient state-tomography technique.

abstract: We study the coherence trapping of a qubit correlated initially with a non-Markovian bath in a pure dephasing channel. By considering the initial qubit-bath correlation and the bath spectral density, we find that the initial qubit-bath correlation can lead to a more efficient coherence trapping than that of the initially separable qubit-bath state. The stationary coherence in the long time limit can be maximized by optimizing the parameters of the initially correlated qubit-bath state and the bath spectral density. In addition, the effects of this initial correlation on the maximal evolution speed for the qubit trapped to its stationary coherence state are also explored.

abstract: We investigate the fidelity of the quantum state transfer (QST) of two qubits by means of an arbitrary spin-1/2 network, on a lattice of any dimensionality. Under the assumptions that the network Hamiltonian preserves the magnetization and that a fully polarized initial state is taken for the lattice, we obtain a general formula for the average fidelity of the two qubits QST, linking it to the one- and two-particle transfer amplitudes of the spin-excitations among the sites of the lattice. We then apply this formalism to a 1D spin chain with XX-Heisenberg type nearest-neighbour interactions adopting a protocol that is a generalization of the single qubit one proposed in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A 87, 062309 (2013)]. We find that a high-quality two qubit QST can be achieved provided one can control the local fields at sites near the sender and receiver. Under such conditions, we obtain an almost perfect transfer in a time that scales either linearly or, depending on the spin number, quadratically with the length of the chain.

Here, by exploiting possibilities for project and entanglement, we substantially widen the scope of its central idea, removing the requirement of indistinguishability. We thereby potentially gain access to a host of new observables, including subtle polarization correlations and entanglement itself. Our considerations also shed light on the physical significance of superselection.

In particular, we can pass from measurements to inferences about "what happened" in a way that is sensible and free of paradox. Our framework allows for a richer understanding of the temporal structure of quantum theory, and we construct history states that embody peculiar, non-classical correlations in time.

abstract: Recent advances in quantum technology have led to the development and manufacturing of experimental programmable quantum annealing optimizers that contain hundreds of quantum bits. These optimizers, named `D-Wave' chips, promise to solve practical optimization problems potentially faster than conventional `classical' computers. Attempts to quantify the quantum nature of these chips have been met with both excitement and skepticism but have also brought up numerous fundamental questions pertaining to the distinguishability of quantum annealers from their classical thermal counterparts. Here, we propose a general method aimed at answering these, and apply it to experimentally study the D-Wave chip. Inspired by spin-glass theory, we generate optimization problems with a wide spectrum of `classical hardness', which we also define. By investigating the chip's response to classical hardness, we surprisingly find that the chip's performance scales unfavorably as compared to several analogous classical algorithms. We detect, quantify and discuss purely classical effects that possibly mask the quantum behavior of the chip.

abstract: We investigate the relationship between non-Markovianity and the effectiveness of a dynamical decoupling protocol for qubits undergoing pure dephasing. We consider an exact model in which dephasing arises due to a bosonic environment with a spectral density of the Ohmic class. This is parametrised by an Ohmicity parameter by changing which we can model both Markovian and non-Markovian environments. Interestingly, we find that engineering a non-Markovian environment is detrimental to the efficiency of the dynamical decoupling scheme, leading to a worse coherence preservation. We show that each dynamical decoupling pulse reverses the flow of quantum information and, on this basis, we investigate the connection between dynamical decoupling efficiency and the reservoir spectral density. Finally, in the spirit of reservoir engineering, we investigate the optimum system-reservoir parameters for achieving maximum stationary coherences.

abstract: As progress on experimental quantum processors continues to advance, the problem of verifying the correct operation of such devices is becoming a pressing concern. Although recent progress has resulted in several protocols which can verify the output of a quantum computation performed by entangled but non-communicating processors, the overhead for such schemes is prohibitive, scaling at least as the 22nd power of the number of gates. We present a new approach based on a combination of verified blind quantum computation and Bell state self-testing. This approach has significantly reduced overhead, with resources scaling as a quartic polynomial in the number of gates.

abstract: Recent advances in theoretical and experimental quantum computing bring us closer to scalable quantum computing devices. This makes the need for protocols that verify the correct functionality of quantum operations timely and has led to the field of quantum verification. In this paper we address key challenges to make quantum verification protocols applicable to experimental implementations. We prove the robustness of the single server verifiable universal blind quantum computing protocol of Fitzsimons and Kashefi (2012) in the most general scenario. This includes the case where the purification of the deviated input state is in the hands of an adversarial server. The proved robustness property allows the composition of this protocol with a device-independent state tomography protocol that we give, which is based on the rigidity of CHSH games as proposed by Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013). The resulting composite protocol has lower round complexity for the verification of entangled quantum servers with a classical verifier and, as we show, can be made fault tolerant.

abstract: We outline a theory of symmetry protected topological phases of one-dimensional quantum walks. We assume spectral gaps around the symmetry-distinguished points +1 and -1, in which only discrete eigenvalues are allowed. The phase classification by integer or binary indices extends the classification known for translation invariant systems in terms of their band structure. However, our theory requires no translation invariance whatsoever, and the indices we define in this general setting are invariant under arbitrary symmetric local perturbations, even those that cannot be continuously contracted to the identity. More precisely we define two indices for every walk, characterizing the behavior far to the right and far to the left, respectively. Their sum is a lower bound on the number of eigenstates at +1 and -1. For a translation invariant system the indices add up to zero, so one of them already characterizes the phase. By joining two bulk phases with different indices we get a walk in which the right and left indices no longer cancel, so the theory predicts bound states at +1 or -1. This is a rigorous statement of bulk-edge correspondence. The results also apply to the Hamiltonian case with a single gap at zero.

abstract: The study of light-matter interaction has seen a resurgence in recent years, stimulated by highly controllable, precise, and modular experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). The achievement of strong coupling, where the coupling between a single atom and fundamental cavity mode exceeds the decay rates, was a major milestone that opened the doors to a multitude of new investigations. Here we introduce multimode strong coupling (MMSC), where the coupling is comparable to the free spectral range (FSR) of the cavity, i.e. the rate at which a qubit can absorb a photon from the cavity is comparable to the round trip transit rate of a photon in the cavity. We realize, via the circuit QED architecture, the first experiment accessing the MMSC regime, and report remarkably widespread and structured resonance fluorescence, whose origin extends beyond cavity enhancement of sidebands. Our results capture complex multimode, multiphoton processes, and the emergence of ultranarrow linewidths. Beyond the novel phenomena presented here, MMSC opens a major new direction in the exploration of light-matter interactions.

abstract: A central goal of the research effort in quantum thermodynamics is the extension of standard thermodynamics to include small-scale and quantum effects. Here we lay out consequences of seeing measurement, one of the central pillars of quantum theory, not merely as a mathematical projection but as a thermodynamic process. We uncover that measurement, a component of any experimental realisation, is accompanied by work and heat contributions and that these are distinct in classical and quantum thermodynamics. Implications are far-reaching, giving a thermodynamic interpretation to quantum coherence, extending the link between thermodynamics and information theory, and providing key input for the construction of a future quantum thermodynamic framework. Repercussions for existing quantum thermodynamic relations that omitted the role of measurement are discussed, including quantum work fluctuation relations and single-shot approaches.

The calibration step involves estimating the error in gates and then using controls to correct the implementation. Quantum process tomography is a standard technique for estimating these errors, but is both time consuming, (when one only wants to learn a few key parameters), and requires resources, like perfect state preparation and measurement, that might not be available. With the goal of efficiently estimating specific errors using minimal resources, we develop a parameter estimation technique, which can gauge two key parameters (amplitude and off-resonance errors) in a single-qubit gate with provable robustness and efficiency. In particular, our estimates achieve the optimal efficiency, Heisenberg scaling. Our main theorem making this possible is a robust version of the phase estimation procedure of Higgins et al. [B. L. Higgins, New J. Phys. 11, 073023 (2009)].

abstract: By coupling pairs of superconducting qubits through a small Josephson junction with a time-dependent flux bias, we show that arbitrary interactions involving any combination of Pauli matrices can be generated with a small number of drive tones applied through the flux bias of the coupling junction. We then demonstrate that similar (though not fully universal) results can be achieved in capacitively coupled qubits by exploiting the higher energy states of the devices through multi-photon drive signals applied to the qubits' flux degrees of freedom. By using this mechanism to couple a qubit to a detuned resonator, the qubit's rotating frame state can be non-destructively measured along any direction on the Bloch sphere. Finally, we describe how the frequency-converting nature of the couplings can be used to engineer a mechanism analogous to dynamic nuclear polarization in NMR systems, capable of cooling an array of qubits well below the ambient temperature, and outline how higher order interactions, such as local 3-body terms, can be engineered through the same couplings. Our results demonstrate that a programmable quantum simulator for large classes of interacting spin models could be engineered with the same physical hardware.

In this way we can also prove and generalize the results obtained by other authors by means of a gauge-like transformation and its generalization. Such similarity transformations also reveal the connection with pseudo-Hermiticity in a simple and straightforward way. In addition to it we consider the positive and negative eigenvalues of a three-parameter non-Hermitian oscillator.

abstract: In spontaneous parametric down-conversion photons are known to be created coherently and with equal probability over the entire length of the crystal. Then, there is no particular position in the crystal where a photon pair is created. We make the seemingly contradictory observation that we can control the time delay with the crystal position along the propagation direction. We resolve this contradiction by showing that the spatio-temporal correlations critically affect the temporal properties of the pair of photons, when using a finite detector size. We expect this to have important implications for experiments that require indistinguishable photons.

abstract: In free-space quantum key distribution (QKD), the sensitivity of the receiver's detector channels may depend differently on the spatial mode of incoming photons. Consequently, an attacker can control the spatial mode to break security. We experimentally investigate a standard polarization QKD receiver, and identify sources of efficiency mismatch in its optical scheme. We model a practical intercept-and-resend attack and show that it would break security in most situations. We show experimentally that adding an appropriately chosen spatial filter at the receiver's entrance is an effective countermeasure.

abstract: In the spin-boson model, a continued fraction form is proposed to systematically resum high-order quantum kinetic expansion (QKE) rate kernels, accounting for the bath relaxation effect beyond the second-order perturbation. In particular, the analytical expression of the sixth-order QKE rate kernel is derived for resummation. With higher-order correction terms systematically extracted from higher-order rate kernels, the resummed quantum kinetic expansion (RQKE) approach in the continued fraction form extends the Pade approximation and can fully recover the exact quantum dynamics as the expansion order increases.

abstract: We present a novel approach called the intermediate rotating wave approximation (IRWA), which employs a time-averaging method to encapsulate the dynamics of light-matter interaction from strong to ultrastrong coupling regime. In contrast to the ordinary rotating wave approximation, this method addresses the co-rotating and counter-rotating terms separately to trace their physical consequences individually, and thus establishes the continuity between the Jaynes-Cummings model and the quantum Rabi model. We investigate IRWA in near resonance and large detuning cases. Our IRWA not only agrees well with both models in their respective coupling strengths, but also offers a good explanation for their differences.

abstract: Quantum optomechanics exploits radiation pressure effects inside optical cavities. It can be used to generate quantum states of the center-of-mass motion of massive mechanical objects, thereby opening up a new parameter regime for macroscopic quantum experiments. The challenging experimental conditions to maintain and observe quantum coherence for increasingly large objects may require a space environment rather than an earth-bound laboratory. We introduce a possible space experiment to study the wave-packet expansion of massive objects. This forms the basis for Schr\"odinger cat states of unprecedented size and mass.

abstract: Starting with the quasi-Bell states of the qubit-oscillator system, we obtain time evolution of the density matrix under the adiabatic approximation. The composite density matrix leads to, via partial tracing of the qubit degree of freedom, the reduced density matrix of the oscillator that is utilized to obtain the quasi-probability distributions such as Glauber-Sudarshan P function, Wigner W function and Husimi Q function. The negativity of the Wigner function acts as a measure of the nonclassicality of the state. The negativity becomes particularly relevant in understanding a comparison between the Wigner entropy with the Wehrl entropy, which are based on the W function and Q function, respectively.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02891
abstract: We present two hyperentanglement concentration schemes for two-photon states that are partially entangled in the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. The first scheme distills a maximally hyperentangled state from two identical less-entangled states with unknown parameters via the Schmidt projection method. The other scheme can be used to concentrate an initial state with known parameters, and requires only one copy of the initial state for the concentration process. Both these two protocols can be generalized to concentrate N-photon hyperentangled Greenberger- Horne-Zeilinger states that are simultaneously entangled in the polarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. Our schemes require only linear optics and are feasible with current technology. Using the time-bin degree of freedom rather than the spatial mode degree of freedom can provide savings in quantum resources, which makes our schemes practical and useful for long-distance quantum communication.

abstract: We report the possibility of completely destructive interference of three indistinguishable photons on a three port device providing a generalisation of the well known Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two indistinguishable photons on a two port device. Our analysis is based on the underlying mathematical framework of SU(3) transformations rather than SU(2) transformations. We show the completely destructive three photon interference for a large range of parameters of the three port device. As each output port can deliver zero to three photons the device generates higher dimensional entanglement. In particular, different forms of entangled states of qudits can be generated depending again on the device parameters. Our system is different from a symmetric three port beam splitter which does not exhibit a three photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.

abstract: A natural generalization of the binary XOR games to the class of XOR-d games with $d > 2$ outcomes is studied. We propose an algebraic bound to the quantum value of these games and use it to derive several interesting properties of these games. As an example, we re-derive in a simple manner a recently discovered bound on the quantum value of the CHSH-d game for prime $d$. It is shown that no total function XOR-d game with uniform inputs can be a pseudo-telepathy game, there exists a quantum strategy to win the game only when there is a classical strategy also. We then study the principle of lack of quantum advantage in the distributed non-local computation of binary functions which is a well-known information-theoretic principle designed to pick out quantum correlations from amongst general no-signaling ones. We prove a large-alphabet generalization of this principle, showing that quantum theory provides no advantage in the task of non-local distributed computation of a restricted class of functions with $d$ outcomes for prime $d$, while general no-signaling boxes do. Finally, we consider the question whether there exist two-party tight Bell inequalities with no quantum advantage, and show that the binary non-local computation game inequalities for the restricted class of functions are not facet defining for any number of inputs.

abstract: We initiate the study of zero-error communication via quantum channels assisted by noiseless feedback link of unlimited quantum capacity, generalizing Shannon's zero-error communication theory with instantaneous feedback. This capacity depends only on the linear span of Kraus operators of the channel, which generalizes the bipartite equivocation graph of a classical channel, and which we dub "non-commutative bipartite graph". We go on to show that the feedback-assisted capacity is non-zero (allowing for a constant amount of activating noiseless communication) if and only if the non-commutative bipartite graph is non-trivial, and give a number of equivalent characterizations. This result involves a far-reaching extension of the "conclusive exclusion" of quantum states [Pusey/Barrett/Rudolph, Nat Phys 8:475, 2012]. We then present an upper bound on the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity, motivated by a conjecture originally made by Shannon and proved by Ahlswede. We demonstrate that this bound is additive and given by a nice minimax formula. We also prove a coding theorem showing that this quantity is the entanglement-assisted capacity against an adversarially chosen channel from the set of all channels with the same Kraus span, which can also be interpreted as the feedback-assisted unambiguous capacity. The proof relies on a generalization of the "Postselection Lemma" (de Finetti reduction) [Christandl/Koenig/Renner, PRL 102:020503, 2009] that allows to reflect additional constraints, and which we believe to be of independent interest. This capacity is a relaxation of the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity; however, we do not know whether they coincide in general. We illustrate our ideas with a number of examples, including classical-quantum channels and Weyl diagonal channels, and close with an extensive discussion of open questions.

abstract: How can one detect entanglement between multiple optical paths sharing a single photon? We address this question by proposing a scalable protocol, which only uses local measurements where single photon detection is combined with small displacement operations. The resulting entanglement witness does not require post-selection, nor assumptions about the photon number in each path. Furthermore, it guarantees that entanglement lies in a subspace with at most one photon per optical path and reveals genuinely multipartite entanglement. We demonstrate its scalability and resistance to loss by performing various experiments with two and three optical paths. We anticipate applications of our results for quantum network certification.

abstract: Different families of generalized CS for one-dimensional systems with general time dependent quadratic Hamiltonian are constructed. In principle, all known CS of systems with quadratic Hamiltonian are members of these families. Some of the constructed generalized CS are close enough to the well-known due to Schr\"odinger and Glauber CS of a harmonic oscillator, we call them simply CS. However, even among these CS there exist different families of complete sets of CS. These families differ by values of standard deviations at the initial time instant. According to the values of these initial standard deviations one can identify some of the families with semiclassical CS. We discuss properties of the constructed CS, in particular, completeness relations, minimization of uncertainty relations and so on. As a unknown application of the general construction, we consider different CS of an oscillator with a time dependent frequency.

abstract: Suppose one wants to certify that a quantum channel is not entanglement-breaking. I consider all four combinations of trusted and untrusted devices at the input and output of the channel, finding that the most interesting is a trusted preparation device at the input and an untrusted measurement device at the output. This provides a time-like analogue of EPR-steering, which turns out to reduce to the problem of joint measurability, connecting these concepts in a different way to other recent work. I suggest a few applications of this connection, such as a resource theory of incompatibility. This perspective also sheds light on why the BB84 key distribution protocol can be secure even with an untrusted measuring device, leading to an uncertainty relation for arbitrary pairs of ensembles.

abstract: Particle delocalization is a common feature of quantum random walks in arbitrary lattices. However, in the typical scenario a particle spreads over multiple sites and its evolution is not directly useful for controlled quantum interferometry, as may be required for technological applications. In this paper we devise a strategy to perfectly split the wave-packet of an incoming particle into two components, each propagating in opposite directions, which reconstruct the shape of the initial wavefunction after a particular time $t^*$. Therefore, a particle in a delta-like initial state becomes exactly delocalized between two distant sites after $t^*$. We find the mathematical conditions to achieve the perfect splitting which are satisfied by viable example Hamiltonians with static site-dependent interaction strengths. Our results pave the way for the generation of peculiar many-body interference patterns in a many-site atomic chain (like the Hanbury Brown and Twiss and quantum Talbot effects) as well as for the distribution of entanglement between remote sites. Thus, as for the case of perfect state transfer, the perfect wave-packet splitting can be a new tool for varied applications.

abstract: The appearance of geometric flow in conservation law of particle number in classical particle diffusion, and the one in the conservation law of probability in quantum mechanics are discussed in a geometrical environment: two dimensional curved surface with thickness $\epsilon$ embedded in $R_3$. In such a system with small parameter $\epsilon$, the usual two dimensional conservation law doesn't hold and we find the anomaly by the equation $\partial \rho / \partial t + \nabla_i^{(2)} J^i \neq 0$, where the density $\rho$, the flow $J^i$, and $\nabla_i^{(2)}$ is the two dimensional covariant derivative. The anomalous term is obtained in $\epsilon$ (thickness of surface) expansion. We find this term has Gaussian and mean curvature dependence and can be written in total divergence of some geometric flow. In total we have $$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla_i^{(2)} (J^i+J_G^i)=0. $$ This fact holds both in classical and quantum mechanics when we confine the particle in curved surface with small thickness.

abstract: It is an established fact that entanglement is a resource. Sharing an entangled state leads to non-local correlations and to violations of Bell inequalities. Such non-local correlations illustrate the advantage of quantum resources over classical resources. Here, we study quantitatively Bell inequalities with $2\times n$ inputs. As found in [N. Gisin et al., Int. J. Q. Inf. 5, 525 (2007)] quantum mechanical correlations cannot reach the algebraic bound for such inequalities. In this paper, we uncover the heart of this effect which we call the {\it fraction of determinism}. We show that any quantum statistics with two parties and $2 \times n$ inputs exhibits nonzero fraction of determinism, and we supply a quantitative bound for it. We then apply it to provide an explicit {\it universal upper bound} for Bell inequalities with $2\times n$ inputs. As our main mathematical tool we introduce and prove a {\it reverse triangle inequality}, stating in a quantitative way that if some states are far away from a given state, then their mixture is also. The inequality is crucial in deriving the lower bound for the fraction of determinism, but is also of interest on its own.

Abramsky and Brandenburger used sheaf theory to give a general treatment of contextuality in quantum theory [New Journal of Physics 13 (2011) 113036]. However, contextual phenomena are found in other fields as well, for example database theory. In this paper, we shall develop this unified view of contextuality. We provide two main contributions: firstly, we expose a remarkable connection between contexuality and logical paradoxes; secondly, we show that an important class of contextuality arguments has a topological origin. More specifically, we show that "All-vs-Nothing" proofs of contextuality are witnessed by cohomological obstructions.

abstract: In recent years it was recognized that properties of physical systems such as entanglement, athermality, and asymmetry, can be viewed as resources for important tasks in quantum information, thermodynamics, and other areas of physics. This recognition followed by the development of specific quantum resource theories (QRTs), such as entanglement theory, determining how quantum states that cannot be prepared under certain restrictions may be manipulated and used to circumvent the restrictions. Here we show that all such QRTs have a general structure, consisting of three components: free states, restricted/allowed set of operations, and resource states. We show that under a few physically motivated assumptions, a QRT is asymptotically reversible if its set of allowed operations is maximal; that is, if the allowed operations are the set of all operations that do not generate (asymptotically) a resource. In this case, the asymptotic conversion rate is given in terms of the regularized relative entropy of a resource which is the unique measure/quantifier of the resource in the asymptotic limit of many copies of the state. We also show that this measure equals the smoothed version of the logarithmic robustness of the resource.

abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to review the progress that has taken place so far in the search for a single unifying principle that harmonizes (i) the wave and particle natures of matter and radiation, both at the quantum and the classical levels, on the one hand and (ii) the classical and quantum theories of matter and radiation on the other hand. The famous paradoxes of quantum theory, the mysterious nature of measurements in quantum theory and the principal no-go theorems for hidden variables are first briefly reviewed. The Koopman-von Neumann Hilbert space theory based on complex wave functions underlying particle trajectories in classical phase space, is an important step forward in that direction. It provides a clear and beautiful harmony of classical waves and particles. Sudarshan has given an alternative but equivalent formulation that shows that classical mechanics can be regarded as a quantum theory with essentially hidden non-commuting variables. An extension of KvNS theory to classical electrodynamics provides a sound Hilbert space foundation to it and satisfactorily accounts for entanglement and Bell-CHSH-like violations already observed in classical polarization optics. An important new insight that has been obtained through these developments is that entanglement and Bell-like inequality violations are neither unique signatures of quantumness nor of non-locality---they are rather signatures of non-separability. Finally, Sudarshan's proposed solution to the measurement problem using KvNS theory for the measuring apparatus is sketched to show to what extent wave and particles can be harmonized in quantum theory.

abstract: The most promising candidate for being the fundamental principle of quantum contextuality is the Exclusivity principle, which states that the sum of the probabilities of a set of pairwise exclusive events cannot exceed 1. By itself, the Exclusivity principle singles out the maximum quantum value for some important Bell and noncontextuality inequalities. We can get better results if we apply the E principle to more sophisticated scenarios. This happens because this principle exhibits activation ?effects: a distribution satisfying this principles does not necessarily satisfy it when combined with other distributions. Activation ?effects can be used to prove that the Exclusivity principle singles out the set of quantum distributions for the most simple noncontextuality inequality. It is still not known if the exclusivity principle solves the problem of explaining quantum contextuality completely, but many results have been proven that support the conjecture that it might. The main purpose of this thesis is to discuss in detail the situations in which the E principle can be used to rule out distributions outside the quantum set.

abstract: We studied full revivals of quantum states in the Jaynes-Cannings model. It is proved that in the case of zero detuning in subspaces generated by two adjacent pairs of energy levels, full revival of the subspace does not exist for any values of the parameters. In the case of non-zero detuning on the contrary, the set of parameters that allows full revival of such subspaces is dense as the subset of all parameters. The nature of these revivals differs from Rabi oscillations in subspaces of a single pair of energy. In more complex subspaces the presence of full revival is reduced to particular cases of 10-th Hilbert problem for rational solutions of systems of nonlinear algebraic equations, which has no algorithmic solution in general case.

The proof rests on a variant of the Berry--Esseen theorem for quantum lattice systems and ideas from quantum information theory.

abstract: The "problem of time" in present physics substantially consists in the fact that a straightforward quantization of the general relativistic evolution equation and constraints generates for the Universe wave function the Wheeler-De Witt equation, which describes a static Universe. Page and Wootters considered the fact that there exist states of a system composed by entangled subsystems that are stationary, but one can interpret the component subsystems as evolving: this leads them to suppose that the global state of the universe can be envisaged as one of this static entangled state, whereas the state of the subsystems can evolve. Here we synthetically present an experiment, based on PDC polarization entangled photons, that allows showing with a practical example a situation where this idea works, i.e. a subsystem of an entangled state works as a "clock" of another subsystem.

abstract: In quantum systems, one usually seeks to minimize dephasing noise and disorder. The efficiency of transport in a quantum system is usually degraded by the presence of noise and disorder. However, it has been shown that the combination of the two can lead to significantly more efficiency than each by itself. Here, we consider how the addition of nonlocal noise, in the form of incoherent hopping, affects the transport efficiency. We show that incoherent hopping introduces additional local extrema in the efficiency function and investigate the crossover from a quantum random walk to a classical random walk.

abstract: Parity measurement is a central tool to many quantum information processing tasks. In this Letter, we propose a method to directly measure two- and four-qubit parity with low overhead in hard- and software, while remaining robust to experimental imperfections. Our scheme relies on dispersive qubit-cavity coupling and photon counting that is sensitive only to intensity; both ingredients are widely realized in many different quantum computing modalities. For a leading technology in quantum computing, superconducting integrated circuits, we analyze the measurement contrast and the back action of the scheme and show that this measurement comes close enough to an ideal parity measurement to be applicable to quantum error correction.

abstract: The Quantum Ergodic Conjecture equates the Wigner function for a typical eigenstate of a classically chaotic Hamiltonian with a delta-function on the energy shell. This ensures the evaluation of classical ergodic expectations of simple observables, in agreement with Shnirelman's theorem, but this putative Wigner function violates several important requirements. Consequently, we transfer the conjecture to the Fourier transform of the Wigner function, that is, the chord function. We show that all the relevant consequences of the usual conjecture require only information contained within a small (Planck) volume around the origin of the phase space of chords: translations in ordinary phase space. Loci of complete orthogonality between a given eigenstate and its nearby translation are quite elusive for the Wigner function, but our local conjecture stipulates that their pattern should be universal for ergodic eigenstates of the same Hamiltonian lying within a classically narrow energy range. Our findings are supported by numerical evidence in a Hamiltonian exhibiting soft chaos. Heavily scarred eigenstates are remarkable counter-examples of the ergodic universal pattern.

abstract: Scaling up linear-optics quantum computing will require multi-photon gates which are compact, phase-stable, exhibit excellent quantum interference, and have success heralded by the detection of ancillary photons. We investigate implementation of the optimal known gate design which meets these requirements: the Knill controlled-Z gate, implemented in integrated laser-written waveguide arrays. We show that device performance is more sensitive to the small deviations in the coupler reflectivity, arising due to the tolerance values of the fabrication method, than phase variations in the circuit. The mode fidelity was also shown to be less sensitive to reflectivity and phase errors than process fidelity. Our best device achieves a fidelity of 0.931+/-0.001 with the ideal 4x4 unitary circuit and a process fidelity of 0.680+/-0.005 with the ideal computational-basis process.

abstract: We have investigated how the dynamics of a quantum particle initially localized in the left boundary site under periodic driving can be manipulated via control of the right boundary site of a lattice array. Because of the adjustable coupling between the right boundary site and its nearest-neighbor, we can realize either coherent destruction of tunneling to coherent tunneling (CDT-CT) transition or coherent tunneling to coherent destruction of tunneling (CT-CDT) transition, by driving or moving the right boundary site while keeping the left boundary site driven by a periodically oscillating field with a fixed driving parameter. In particular, the transition direction shows odd-even sensitivity to the number of lattice sites. We have also revealed that our proposed CDT-CT transition is robust against the second order coupling (SOC) between next-nearest-neighbor sites in odd-$N$-site systems, whereas localization can be significantly enhanced by SOC in even-$N$-site systems. More interestingly, it is found destruction and revival of CDT observable in non-high-frequency regimes. Our results can be readily verified within the capacity of current experiments.

Here we summarize it in a self contained brief presentation including all its principal elements.

abstract: Within the quantum Darwinist framework introduced by W. H. Zurek (Nat. Phys., 5:181-188, 2009), observers obtain pointer-state information about quantum systems by interacting with the surrounding environment, e.g. the ambient photon field. This framework is applied to the observation of stellar center-of-mass positions, which are assumed to be encoded in a way that is uniformly accessible to all observers regardless of their location. Assuming Landauer's Principle, constructing such environmental encodings requires $\sim$ kT per bit. For 10$^{25}$ stars and a binary encoding of center-of-mass positions into (10 km)$^{3}$ voxels, the free energy required at T = 2.7 K is $\sim$ 5 $\cdot$ 10$^{-27}$ kg $\cdot$ m$^{-3}$, in striking agreement with the observed value of $\Omega_{\Lambda} \rho_{c}$. Decreasing the voxel size to $l_{P}^{3}$ results in a free energy requirement 10$^{117}$ times larger.

abstract: We study the robustness of the bucket brigade quantum random access memory model introduced by Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160501 (2008)]. Due to a result of Regev and Schiff [ICALP '08 pp. 773], we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order $o(2^{-n/2})$ (where $N=2^n$ is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as a oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of "active" gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected.

abstract: We propose a protocol for countering the effects of dephasing in quantum state transfer over a noisy spin channel weakly coupled to the sender and receiver qubits. Our protocol, based on performing regular global measurements on the channel, significantly suppresses the nocuous environmental effects and offers much higher fidelities than the traditional no-measurement approach. Our proposal can also operate as a robust two-qubit entangling gate over distant spins. Our scheme counters any source of dephasing, including those for which the well established dynamical decoupling approach fails. Our protocol is probabilistic, given the intrinsic randomness in quantum measurements, but its success probability can be maximized by adequately tuning the rate of the measurements.

abstract: In this paper, a novel protocol for bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation (BCQT) is proposed. Based on entanglement swapping of initiate Bell state, two users can teleport an unknown single-qubit state to each other under the permission of the supervisor. This proposed protocol would be utilized to a system in which a controller controls the communication in one direction only. Indeed, just one of the users needs the permission of the controller to reconstruct the unknown quantum state. In comparison to the existing BCQT protocols which their quantum channels are cluster and brown state, the proposed protocol is more practical within todays technology, since it merely uses Bell states as the quantum resource.

abstract: Photonic-crystal-based integrated optical systems have been used for a broad range of sensing applications with great success. This has been motivated by several advantages such as high sensitivity, miniaturization, remote sensing, selectivity and stability. Many photonic crystal sensors have been proposed with various fabrication designs that result in improved optical properties. Here we propose a novel multi-purpose sensor architecture that can be used for force, refractive index and possibly local temperature detection. In this scheme, two coupled cavities behave as an "effective beam splitter". The sensor works based on fourth order interference (the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect) and requires a sequence of single photon pulses and consequently has low pulse power. Changes in the parameter to be measured induce variations in the effective beam splitter reflectivity and result in changes to the visibility of interference. We demonstrate this generic scheme in coupled L3 photonic crystal cavities as an example and find that this system, which only relies on photon coincidence detection and does not need any spectral resolution, can estimate forces as small as 10^-7 Newtons and can measure one part per million change in refractive index using a very low input power of 10^-10W.

abstract: Recently, Li and Nie (Int. J. Theo. Phys. 52:1630, 2013) had introduced a bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation (BCQT) protocol by using GHZ-Bell state as a quantum channel. Also, Shukla et al. (Int. J. Theo. Phys. 52:3790, 2013) had shown the Li and Nie (LN) protocol is not a BCQT scheme. In this paper, two kinds of bidirectional teleportation schemes in order to correct and improve LN protocol are presented. In the first scheme, Alice and Bob as two legitimate users can simultaneously teleport an unknown single-qubit state to each other with the help of controller Charlie. In the second scheme, Alice can transmit two-qubit entangled state to Bob and at the same time Bob can teleport single-qubit state to Alice. In both of proposed schemes the quantum channel linking users is a GHZ-Bell state.

abstract: Coherent feedback control of quantum systems has demonstrable advantages over measurement-based control, but so far there has been little work done on coherent estimators and more specifically coherent observers. Coherent observers are input the coherent output of a specified quantum plant, and are designed such that some subset of the observer and plant's expectation values converge in the asymptotic limit. We previously developed a class of mean tracking (MT) observers for open harmonic oscillators that only converged in mean position and momentum; Here we develop a class of covariance matrix tracking (CMT) coherent observers that track both the mean and covariance matrix of a quantum plant. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a CMT observer, and find there are more restrictions on a CMT observer than there are on a MT observer. We give examples where we demonstrate how to design a CMT observer and show it can be used to track properties like the entanglement of a plant. As the CMT observer provides more quantum information than a MT observer, we expect it will have greater application in future coherent feedback schemes mediated by coherent observers. Investigation of coherent quantum estimators and observers is important in the ongoing discussion of quantum measurement; As they provide estimation of a system's quantum state without explicit use of the measurement postulate in their derivation.

abstract: The numerical generation of pseudo-random quantum states is an important procedure for investigations in quantum information science. In general, this endeavor requires from the beginning some kind of parametrization for the density matrices. The overparametrized method can be used to create pseudo-random positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace from pseudo-randomly produced general complex matrices in a simple way that is friendly for numerical implementations. In this article we first discuss a relevant issue related to the possible domains that may be used for the real and imaginary parts of the elements of such general complex matrices. Afterwards the problem of a too fast concentration of measure in the quantum state space that appears in this parametrization is reported. Our results show that care must be taken when using this method and also that it is not in general a sensible choice if one wants a reasonably fair sampling in the space of density matrices.

abstract: We propose a selective dynamical decoupling scheme on a chain of permanently coupled qubits, which is capable of dynamically suppressing any coupling in the chain by applying sequences of local pulses to the individual qubits. We demonstrate how this pulse control can be used to implement a sequence of quantum gates on the chain which entangles all the qubits. We find that high entanglement fidelities can be achieved as long as the total number of coupled qubits is not too large. We discuss the applicability of our model specifically for superconducting flux qubits which can be strongly coupled to allow for the fast implementation of two-qubit gates. Since dynamically modifying the couplings between flux qubits is challenging, they are a natural candidate for our approach.

We compare this approach to the well-known Generalized Langevin Equation and we show that our dynamics satisfies this equation.

abstract: In the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, both the resonance frequency and the coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave field modes can be controlled via external electric and magnetic fields to explore qubit -- photon dynamics in a wide parameter range. Here, we experimentally demonstrate and analyze a scheme for tuning the coupling between a transmon qubit and a microwave resonator using a single coherent drive tone. We treat the transmon as a three-level system with the qubit subspace defined by the ground and the second excited states. If the drive frequency matches the difference between the resonator and the qubit frequency, a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction is induced, which is tunable both in amplitude and phase. We show that coupling strengths of about 10 MHz can be achieved in our setup, limited only by the anharmonicity of the transmon qubit. This scheme has been successfully used to generate microwave photons with controlled temporal shape [Pechal et al., Phys. Rev. X 4, 041010 (2014)] and can be directly implemented with superconducting quantum devices featuring larger anharmonicity for higher coupling strengths.

The states with non-zero discord and zero entanglement generated by the dynamical Casimir effect are a useful resource for quantum cryptography.

abstract: Time evolution of quantum systems is of interest in physics, in chemistry, and, more recently, in computer science. Quantum computers are suggested as one route to propagating quantum systems far more efficiently than ordinary numerical methods. In the past few years, researchers have actively been improving quantum simulation algorithms, especially those in second quantization. This work continues to advance the state-of-the-art by unifying several diverging approaches under a common framework. In particular, it highlights the similarities and differences of the first and second quantized algorithms which are usually presented in a distinct fashion. By combining aspects of the two approaches, this work moves towards an online second quantized algorithm operating within a single-Fock space. This paper also unifies a host of approaches to algorithmic quantum measurement by removing superficial differences. The aim of the effort is not only to give a high-level understanding of quantum simulation, but to move towards experimentally realizable algorithms with practical applications in chemistry and beyond.

abstract: We propose a hybrid system with quantum mechanical three-body interactions between photons, phonons, and qubit excitations. These interactions take place in a circuit quantum electrodynamical architecture with a superconducting microwave resonator coupled to a transmon qubit whose shunt capacitance is free to mechanically oscillate. We show that this system design features a three-mode polariton--mechanical mode and a nonlinear transmon--mechanical mode interaction in the strong coupling regime. Together with the strong resonator--transmon interaction, these properties provide intriguing opportunities for manipulations of this hybrid quantum system. We show, in particular, the feasibility of cooling the mechanical motion down to its ground state and preparing various nonclassical states including mechanical Fock and cat states and hybrid tripartite entangled states.

abstract: We study two-level systems (2LS) coupled at different points to a one-dimensional waveguide in which one end is open and the other is either open (infinite waveguide) or closed by a mirror (semi-infinite). Upon injection of two photons (corresponding to weak coherent driving), the resonance fluorescence and photon correlations are shaped by the effective qubit transition frequencies and decay rates, which are substantially modified by interference effects. In contrast to the well-known result in an infinite waveguide, photons reflected by a single 2LS coupled to a semi-infinite waveguide are initially bunched, a result that can be simply explained by stimulated emission. As the number of 2LS increases (up to 10 are considered here), rapid oscillations build up in the correlations that persist for a very long time. For instance, when the incoming photons are slightly detuned, the transmitted photons in the infinite waveguide are highly antibunched. On the other hand, upon resonant driving, incoherently reflected photons are mostly distributed within the photonic band gap and several sharp side peaks. These features can be explained by considering the poles of the single particle Green function in the Markovian regime combined with the time delay. Our calculation is not restricted to the Markovian regime, and we obtain several fully non-Markovian results. We show that a single 2LS in a semi-infinite waveguide can not be decoupled by placing it at the node of the photonic field, in contrast to recent results in the Markovian regime. Our results illustrate the complexities that ensue when several qubits are strongly coupled to a bus (the waveguide) as might happen in quantum information processing.

abstract: It is argued that the severe consequences of Haag's inconsistency theorem for relativistic quantum field theories can be successfully evaded in the direct-action approach. Some recent favorable comments of John Wheeler, often mistakenly presumed to have abandoned his own (and Feynman's) direct-action theory, together with the remarkable immunity of direct-action quantum electrodynamics to Haag's theorem, suggest that it may well be a good time to rehabilitate direct action theories. It is also noted that, as extra dividends, direct-action QED is immune to the self-energy problem of standard gauge field QED, and can also provide a solution to the problem of gauge arbitrariness.

abstract: We show that a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, in which the notion of event is defined without reference to measurement or observers, allows to construct a quantum general ontology based on systems, states and events. Unlike the Copenhagen interpretation, it does not resort to elements of a classical ontology. The quantum ontology in turn allows us to recognize that a typical behavior of quantum systems exhibits strong emergence and ontological non-reducibility. Such phenomena are not exceptional but natural, and are rooted in the basic mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Tackling heat dissipation in electronic devices is an ultimate goal of information technology. Quantum systems are inherently dissipation-less, making them excellent candidates even for classical information processing. We propose to use an array of large-spin quantum magnets for realizing a device which has two modes of operation: memory and data-bus. While the weakly interacting low-energy levels are used as memory to store classical information (bits), the high-energy levels strongly interact with neighboring magnets and mediate the spatial movement of information through quantum dynamics. Despite the fact that memory and data-bus require different features, which are usually prerogative of different physical systems -- well isolation for the memory cells, and strong interactions for the transmission -- our proposal avoids the notorious complexity of hybrid structures. The proposed mechanism can be realized with different setups. We specifically show that molecular magnets, as the most promising technology, can implement hundreds of operations within their coherence time, while adatoms on surfaces probed by a scanning tunneling microscope is a future possibility.

abstract: By combining a squeezed propagating microwave field and an unsqueezed vacuum field on a hybrid (microwave beam-splitter), we generate entanglement between the two output modes. We verify that we have generated entangled states by making independent and efficient single-quadrature measurements of the two output modes. We observe the entanglement witness $E_\mathrm{W}=-0.263^{+0.001}_{-0.036}$ and the negativity $N=0.0824^{+0.01}_{-0.0004}$ with measurement efficiencies at least $26\pm{0.1}\%$ and $41\pm{0.2}\%$ for channel~1 and 2 respectively. These measurements show that the output two-mode state violates the separability criterion and therefore demonstrate entanglement. This shared entanglement between propagating microwaves provides an important resource for building quantum networks with superconducting microwave systems.

abstract: John St. Bell was a physicist working most of his time at CERN and contributing intensively and sustainably to the development of Particle Physics and Collider Physics. As a hobby he worked on so-called "foundations of quantum theory", that was that time very unpopular, even considered to be scientifically taboo. His 1964-theorem, showing that predictions of local realistic theories are different to those of quantum theory, initiated a new field in quantum physics: quantum information theory. The violation of Bell's theorem, for instance, is a necessary and sufficient criterion for generating a secure key for cryptography at two distant locations. This contribution shows how Bell's theorem can be brought to the realm of high energy physics and presents the first conclusive experimental feasible test for weakly decaying neutral mesons on the market. Strong experimental and theoretical limitations make a Bell test in weakly decaying systems such as mesons and hyperons very challenging, however, these systems show an unexpected and puzzling relation to another big open question: why is our Universe dominated by matter, why did the antimatter slip off the map? This long outstanding problem becomes a new perspective via the very idea behind quantum information.

abstract: In special relativity, time and space are necessarily interconvertible in order that the speed of light is an invariant. This places time and space on an equal footing which, perplexingly, does not carry over to other areas of physics. For example in quantum mechanics, time is treated classically whereas space is associated with a quantum description. Differences between time and space are also found in the violation of the discrete symmetries of charge conjugation, parity inversion and time reversal---the violations are inferred from the decay of particles over time irrespective of their position in space, and so they are associated with translations in time but not in space. Although these violations are clearly important, their wider implications are unknown. We show here that when the violations are included explicitly in a quantum formalism, remarkable differences arise between the character of quantum states in time and space. In particular, despite time and space having an equal footing at a fundamental level, we find that quantum states can be localised in space and yet have unbounded evolution in time. As such, the violations are shown to play a defining role in the asymmetry between time and space in quantum mechanics.

abstract: Weak measurement is a new way to manipulate and control quantum systems. Different from projection measurement, weak measurement only makes a small change in status. Applying weak measurement to quantum discord, Singh and Pati proposed a new kind of quantum correlations called "super quantum discord (SQD)" [Annals of Physics \textbf{343},141(2014)]. Unfortunately, the super quantum discord is also difficult to calculate. There are only few explicit formulae about SQD. We derive an analytical formulae of SQD for general X-type two-qubit states, which surpass the conclusion for Werner states and Bell diagonal states. Furthermore, our results reveal more knowledge about the new insight of quantum correlation and give a new way to compare SQD with normal quantum discord. Finally, we analyze its dynamics under nondissipative channels.

abstract: We show that during stochastic beam attenuation in double slit experiments, there appear unexpected new effects for transmission factors below $a\lesssim10^{-4}$, which can eventually be observed with the aid of weak measurement techniques. These are denoted as quantum sweeper effects, which are characterized by the bunching together of low counting rate particles within very narrow spatial domains. We employ a "superclassical" modeling procedure which we have previously shown to produce predictions identical with those of standard quantum theory. Thus it is demonstrated that in reaching down to ever weaker channel intensities, the nonlinear nature of the probability density currents becomes ever more important. We finally show that the resulting unexpected effects nevertheless implicitly also exist in standard quantum mechanics.

abstract: The growing successes in performing quantum control experiments motivated the development of control landscape analysis as a basis to explain these findings.When a quantum system is controlled by an electromagnetic field, the observable as a functional of the control field forms a landscape. Theoretical analyses have revealed many properties of control landscapes, especially regarding their slopes, curvatures, and topologies. A full experimental assessment of the landscape predictions is important for future consideration of controlling quantum phenomena. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is exploited here as an ideal laboratory setting for quantitative testing of the landscape principles. The experiments are performed on a simple two-level proton system in a H$_2$O-D$_2$O sample. We report a variety of NMR experiments roving over the control landscape based on estimation of the gradient and Hessian, including ascent or descent of the landscape, level set exploration, and an assessment of the theoretical predictions on the structure of the Hessian. The experimental results are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions. The procedures employed in this study provide the basis for future multispin control landscape exploration where additional features are predicted to exist.

The requirements regarding sideband resolution, circulating cavity power and environmental temperature are in reach with state of the art parameters of optomechanical crystals. Phonon antibunching can be verfied in a Hanburry-Brown-Twiss measurement on the output field of the optomechanical cavity.

abstract: The spectral gap -- the difference in energy between the ground state and the first excited state -- is one of the most important properties of a quantum many-body system. Quantum phase transitions occur when the spectral gap vanishes and the system becomes critical. Much of physics is concerned with understanding the phase diagrams of quantum systems, and some of the most challenging and long-standing open problems in theoretical physics concern the spectral gap, such as the Haldane conjecture that the Heisenberg chain is gapped for integer spin, proving existence of a gapped topological spin liquid phase, or the Yang-Mills gap conjecture (one of the Millennium Prize problems). These problems are all particular cases of the general spectral gap problem: Given a quantum many-body Hamiltonian, is the system it describes gapped or gapless? Here we show that this problem is undecidable, in the same sense as the Halting Problem was proven to be undecidable by Turing. A consequence of this is that the spectral gap of certain quantum many-body Hamiltonians is not determined by the axioms of mathematics, much as Goedels incompleteness theorem implies that certain theorems are mathematically unprovable. We extend these results to prove undecidability of other low temperature properties, such as correlation functions. The proof hinges on simple quantum many-body models that exhibit highly unusual physics in the thermodynamic limit.

abstract: For many experimental quantum information devices, the central system is well isolated against simple decoherence processes such as spontaneous emission or coupling to a heat bath, but it is sub- ject to some imperfections in the apparatus. To describe this situation, we insert a near environment which provides the residual coupling between central system and heath bath, and neglect any direct couplings. In the framework of random matrix theory we calculate the decoherence of the central system, using a linear response expansion for the coupling to the far environment and a dephasing coupling between central system and near environment. We find that the increase of the coupling to the far environment will slow down the decoherence in the central system, and thus improve the quality of the device. We extend this result to stronger couplings by numerical calculations in a modified Caldeira-Leggett model.

abstract: We consider the collapse of a macroscopic quantum superposition occurring due to the measurement which optimally distinguishes its branches. Given a macroscopic superposition of N spin-1/2 particles, we use such a Helstrom measurement to construct the local unitary operator which maximizes the usefulness of the superposition for Heisenberg-limited phase estimation (i.e., with quantum Cram\'{e}r Rao bound proportional to 1/N). In contrast, the collapsed state is not useful as a probe for phase estimation below the standard quantum limit. For the case N=2, we compute the entanglement entropy of the collapsed state and show that it is reduced below that of the initial superposition when the superposition is macroscopic. We consider the remnant quantum resources of collapsed hierarchical Schr\"{o}dinger cat states to show that collapsed macroscopic superpositions can still be useful for ultraprecise quantum metrology.

abstract: We present a detailed analysis of continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) with both position and transition defects defined at a single point in the line. Analytical solutions of both traveling waves or bound states are obtained, which provide valuable insight into the dynamics of CTQW. The number of bound states is found to be critically dependent on the defect parameters, and the localized probability peaks can be readily obtained by projecting the CTQW wavefunction on to these bound states. The interference between two bound states are also observed in the case of a transition defect. The spreading of CTQW probability over the line can be finely tuned by varying the position and transition defect parameters, offering the possibility of precision quantum control of the system.

abstract: Trapped ion crystals have proved to be one of the most viable physical implementations of quantum registers and a promising candidate for a scalable realization of quantum networks. The latter will require the development of an efficient interface between trapped ions and photons. We describe two research directions that are currently investigated to realize such photonic quantum interfaces in free space using high numerical aperture optics. The first approach investigates how strong focusing of light onto a single ion can increase the interaction strength to achieve efficient interaction between a photon and the ion. The second approach uses a probabilistic measurement on scattered photons to generate entanglement between two ions that could be used to distribute information in a quantum network. For both approaches a higher numerical aperture would increase the efficiency of the interface.

abstract: Together with photon emission, the absorption of a single photon by a single atom is a fundamental process in matter-light interaction that manifests its quantum mechanical nature. As an experimentally controlled process, it is a key tool for the realization of quantum technologies. In particular, in an atom/photon based quantum network scenario, in which localized atomic particles are used as quantum information processing nodes while photons are used as carriers of quantum information between distant nodes, controlling both emission and absorption of single photons by single atoms is required for quantum coherent state mapping between the two entities. Most experimental efforts to date have focused on establishing the control of single photon emission by single trapped atoms, and the implementation of quantum networking protocols using this interaction. In this chapter, we describe experimental efforts to control the process of single photon absorption by single trapped ions. We describe a series of experiments in which polarization entangled photon pairs, generated by a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, are coupled to a single ion. First the source is operated to generate heralded single photons, and coincidences between the absorption event of one photon of the pair and the detection of the heralding partner photon are observed. We then show how polarization control in the process is established, leading to the manifestation of the photonic polarization entanglement in the absorption process. Finally, we introduce protocols in which this interaction scheme is harnessed to perform tasks in a quantum network, such as entanglement distribution among distant nodes of the network, and we demonstrate a specific protocol for heralded, high-fidelity photon-to-atom quantum state transfer.

abstract: The 240 root vectors of the Lie algebra E8 lead to a system of 120 rays in a real 8-dimensional Hilbert space that contains a large number of parity proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem. After introducing the rays in a triacontagonal representation due to Coxeter, we present their Kochen-Specker diagram in the form of a "basis table" showing all 2025 bases (i.e., sets of eight mutually orthogonal rays) formed by the rays. Only a few of the bases are actually listed, but simple rules are given, based on the symmetries of E8, for obtaining all the other bases from the ones shown. The basis table is an object of great interest because all the parity proofs of E8 can be exhibited as subsets of it. We show how the triacontagonal representation of E8 facilitates the identification of substructures that are more easily searched for their parity proofs. We have found hundreds of different types of parity proofs, ranging from 9 bases (or contexts) at the low end to 35 bases at the high end, and involving projectors of various ranks and multiplicities. After giving an overview of the proofs we found, we present a few concrete examples of the proofs that illustrate both their generic features as well as some of their more unusual properties. In particular, we present a proof involving 34 rays and 9 bases that appears to be the most compact parity proof found to date in 8 dimensions.

abstract: A scheme to achieve spin squeezing using a geometric phase induced by a single mechanical mode is proposed. The analytical and numerical results show that the ultimate degree of spin squeezing depends on the parameter $\frac{n_{th}+1/2}{Q\sqrt{N}}$, which is the ratio between the thermal excitation, the quality factor and square root of ensemble size. The undesired coupling between the spin ensemble and the bath can be efficiently suppressed by Bang-Bang control pulses. With high quality factor, the ultimate limit of the ideal one-axis twisting spin squeezing can be obtained for an NV ensemble in diamond.

abstract: The privacy amplification term, of which the lower bound needs to be estimated with the decoy-state method, plays a positive role in the secure key rate formula for decoy-state quantum key distribution. In previous work, the yield and the bit error rate of single-photon state are estimated separately to gain this lower bound. In this work, we for the first time take the privacy amplification term as a whole to consider this lower bound. The mathematical description for the correlation between the yield and the bit error rate of single-photon state is given with just two unknown variables. Based on this, we obtain the global estimation of this lower bound for both BB84 protocol and measurement-device-independent protocol. The results of numerical simulation show that the global estimation can significantly improve the performance of quantum key distribution.

abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of extracting secret key from an eavesdropped source $p_{XYZ}$ at a rate given by the conditional mutual information. We investigate this question under three different scenarios: (i) Alice ($X$) and Bob ($Y$) are unable to communicate but share common randomness with the eavesdropper Eve ($Z$), (ii) Alice and Bob are allowed one-way public communication, and (iii) Alice and Bob are allowed two-way public communication. Distributions having a key rate of the conditional mutual information are precisely those in which a "helping" Eve offers Alice and Bob no greater advantage for obtaining secret key than a fully adversarial one. For each of the above scenarios, strong necessary conditions are derived on the structure of distributions attaining a secret key rate of $I(X:Y|Z)$. In obtaining our results, we completely solve the problem of secret key distillation under scenario (i) and identify $H(S|Z)$ to be the optimal key rate using shared randomness, where $S$ is the G\'acs-K\"orner Common Information. We thus provide an operational interpretation of the conditional G\'acs-K\"orner Common Information. Additionally, we introduce simple example distributions in which the rate $I(X:Y|Z)$ is achievable if and only if two-way communication is allowed.

abstract: In this letter we introduce the problem of secrecy reversibility. This asks when two honest parties can distill secret bits from some tripartite distribution $p_{XYZ}$ and transform secret bits back into $p_{XYZ}$ at equal rates using local operation and public communication (LOPC). This is the classical analog to the well-studied problem of reversibly concentrating and diluting entanglement in a quantum state. We identify the structure of distributions possessing reversible secrecy when one of the honest parties holds a binary distribution, and it is possible that all reversible distributions have this form. These distributions are more general than what is obtained by simply constructing a classical analog to the family of quantum states known to have reversible entanglement. An indispensable tool used in our analysis is a conditional form of the G\'{a}cs-K\"{o}rner Common Information.

abstract: In this contribution, we investigate the entanglement behavior of a composite system consists of two different dimensional subsystems in non-inertial frames. In particular, we consider a composite system of qubit(two-dimensional) subsystem, and qutrit, (three-dimensional) subsystem. The degree of entanglement is quantified for different cases, where it is assumed that the two-subsystems are simultaneously or non- simultaneously accelerated. The entanglement decays as the acceleration of any subsystem increases.In general, the decay rate of entanglement increases as the dimensional of the accelerated subsystem increases. These results could be important in building an accelerated quantum network consists of different dimensions nodes.

abstract: In Quantum Physics there are circumstances where the direct measurement of particular observables encounters diffculties; in some of these cases, however, its value can be evaluated, i.e. it can be inferred by measuring another observable characterized by perfect correlation with the observable of interest. Though an evaluation is often interpreted as a measurement of the evaluated observable, we prove that the two concepts cannot be identified in Quantum Physics, because the identifcation yields contradictions. Then, we establish the conceptual status of evaluations in Quantum Theory and the role can be ascribed to them.

abstract: We show that any abstract quantum information theory based on anticommuting operators must be supplemented by a superselection rule deeply rooted in relativity. While quantum information may be encoded in the Fock space generated by such operators, the unrestricted fermionic theory has a peculiar feature: Pairs of bipartition marginals of pure states need not have identical spectra. This leads to an ambiguous definition of the entropy of entanglement. We prove that this problem is removed by a superselection rule that arises from Lorentz invariance and no-signalling.

abstract: A bosonic state is commonly considered nonclassical (or quantum) if its Glauber-Sudarshan $P$ function is not a classical probability density, which implies that only coherent states and their statistical mixtures are classical. We quantify the nonclassicality of a single qubit, defined by the vacuum and single-photon states, by applying the following four well-known measures of nonclassicality: (1) the nonclassical depth, $\tau$, related to the minimal amount of Gaussian noise which changes a nonpositive $P$ function into a positive one; (2) the nonclassical distance $D$, defined as the Bures distance of a given state to the closest classical state, which is the vacuum for the single-qubit Hilbert space; together with (3) the negativity potential (NP) and (4) concurrence potential, which are the nonclassicality measures corresponding to the entanglement measures (i.e., the negativity and concurrence, respectively) for the state generated by mixing a single-qubit state with the vacuum on a balanced beam splitter. We show that complete statistical mixtures of the vacuum and single-photon states are the most nonclassical single-qubit states regarding the distance $D$ for a fixed value of both the depth $\tau$ and NP in the whole range $[0,1]$ of their values, as well as the NP for a given value of $\tau$ such that $\tau>0.3154$. Conversely, pure states are the most nonclassical single-qubit states with respect to $\tau$ for a given $D$, NP versus $D$, and $\tau$ versus NP. We also show the "relativity" of these nonclassicality measures by comparing pairs of single-qubit states: if a state is less nonclassical than another state according to some measure then it might be more nonclassical according to another measure. Moreover, we find that the concurrence potential is equal to the nonclassical distance for single-qubit states.

These states are analogs of surface states in crystalline solids, and they significantly affect resonant excitation of molecular rotation by laser pulse trains.

abstract: We study the characteristics of the light generated by few emitters in a cavity at strong light-matter coupling. By means of the Glauber $g^{(2)}$-function we can identify clearly distinguished parameter regimes with super-Poissonian and sub-Poissonian photon statistics. We establish a relation between the emission characteristics for one and multiple emitters, and explain its origin in terms of the photon-dressed emitter states. Cooperative effects lead to the generation of nonclassical light already at reduced light-matter coupling if the number of emitters is increased. Our results are obtained with a full input-output formalism and master equation valid also at strong light-matter coupling. We compare the behavior obtained with and without counter-rotating light-matter interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, and find that the generation of nonclassical light is robust against such modifications. Finally, we contrast our findings with the predictions of the quantum optical master equation and find that it fails entirely at predicting regimes with different photon statistics.

abstract: A universal quantum computer can be made to mimic the dynamics of any physical system, a feat possible on classical machines only with significant approximations or mean-field methods. Use of the Trotter formula is central to this endeavour: by repeatedly simulating a series of component evolutions, in principle it allows for the quantum computer to be efficiently driven arbitrarily close to an ideal time evolution described by a piecewise-local Hamiltonian. Here we show that the ability to reduce the simulation error (which we quantify in a variety of ways, including with the diamond norm) at will (theoretically achieved by increasing the number of control gates per unit time) is lost when finite imperfections in the control of the quantum computer are introduced. The imperfections thus set a bound in the accuracy of the simulation and on the maximum simulation time. We provide analytical results and numerical data exploring these limits and suggestions on how to achieve them in the laboratory. Our investigations indicate the optimum number of Trotter steps to employ.

abstract: We give a fermionic Fock space description of embedded entangled qubits. Within this framework the problem of classification of pure state entanglement boils down to the problem of classifying spinors. The usual notion of separable states turns out to be just a special case of the one of pure spinors. By using the notion of single, double and mixed occupancy representation with intertwiners relating them a natural physical interpretation of embedded qubits is found. As an application of these ideas one can make a physically sound meaning of some of the direct sum structures showing up in the context of the so-called Black-Hole/Qubit Correspondence. We discuss how the usual invariants for qubits serving as measures of entanglement can be obtained from invariants for spinors in an elegant manner. In particular a detailed case study for recovering the invariants for four-qubits within a spinorial framework is presented. We also observe that reality conditions on complex spinors defining Majorana spinors for embedded qubits boil down to self conjugate states under the Wootters spin flip operation. Finally we conduct a study on the explicit structure of $Spin(16,\mathbb{C})$ invariant polynomials related to the structure of possible measures of entanglement for fermionic systems with 8 modes. Here we find an algebraically independent generating set of the generalized SLOCC invariants and calculate their restriction to the dense orbit. We point out the special role the largest exceptional group $E_8$ is playing in these considerations.

abstract: Multipartite quantum systems show properties which do not admit a classical explanation. In particular, even nonentangled states can enjoy a kind of quantum correlations called quantum discord. I discuss some recent results on the role of quantum discord in metrology. Given an interferometric phase estimation protocol where the Hamiltonian is initially unknown to the experimentalist, the quantum discord of the probe state quantifies the minimum precision of the estimation. This provides a physical interpretation to a widely investigated information-theoretic quantity.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04567
abstract: The lazy random walk, where the walker has some probability of staying put, is a useful tool in classical algorithms. We propose a quantum analogue, the lackadaisical quantum walk, where each vertex is given $l$ self-loops, and we investigate its effects on Grover's algorithm when formulated as search for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices. For the discrete-time quantum walk using the phase flip coin, adding a self-loop to each vertex boosts the success probability from 1/2 to 1. Additional self-loops, however, decrease the success probability. Using instead the Ambainis, Kempe, and Rivosh (2005) coin, adding self-loops simply slows down the search. These coins also differ in that the first is faster than classical when $l$ scales less than $N$, while the second requires that $l$ scale less than $N^2$. Finally, continuous-time quantum walks differ from both of these discrete-time examples---the self-loops make no difference at all. These behaviors generalize to multiple marked vertices.

abstract: We show that the spectral gap problem is undecidable. Specifically, we construct families of translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians on a 2D square lattice of $d$-level quantum systems ($d$ constant), for which determining whether the system is gapped or gapless is an undecidable problem. This is true even with the promise that each Hamiltonian is either gapped or gapless in the strongest sense: it is promised to either have continuous spectrum above the ground state in the thermodynamic limit, or its spectral gap is lower-bounded by a constant in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, this constant can be taken equal to the local interaction strength of the Hamiltonian. This implies that it is logically impossible to say in general whether a quantum many-body model is gapped or gapless. Our results imply that for any consistent, recursive axiomatisation of mathematics, there exist specific Hamiltonians for which the presence or absence of a spectral gap is independent of the axioms. These results have a number of important implications for condensed matter and many-body quantum theory.

abstract: We prove a new version of the Holevo bound. Suppose Alice is sending classical information to Bob using a quantum channel, where Bob is using only a subclass of POVM measurements. We present a divergence measure between the distribution on the product space of Alice and Bob, (X,Y), and the tensor of the two marginal distributions on X and Y. We then bound the above classical divergence by its quantum counterpart. This constitutes a Holevo-type upper bound on the mutual information of Alice and Bob which is formulated using the novel concept of quantum logical entropy.

abstract: Classical satisfiability (SAT) and quantum satisfiability (QSAT) are complete problems for the complexity classes NP and QMA which are believed to be intractable for classical and quantum computers, respectively. Statistical ensembles of instances of these problems have been studied previously in an attempt to elucidate their typical, as opposed to worst case, behavior. In this paper we introduce a new statistical ensemble that interpolates between classical and quantum. For the simplest 2-SAT/2-QSAT ensemble we find the exact boundary that separates SAT and UNSAT instances. We do so by establishing coincident lower and upper bounds, in the limit of large instances, on the extent of the UNSAT and SAT regions, respectively.

abstract: We analytically treat the scattering of two counter-propagating photons on a two-level emitter embedded in an optical waveguide. We find that the non-linearity of the emitter can give rise to significant pulse-dependent directional correlations in the scattered photonic state, which could be quantified via a reduction in coincident clicks in a Hong-Ou-Mandel measurement setup, analogous to a linear beam splitter. Changes to the spectra and phase of the scattered photons, however, would lead to reduced interference with other photons when implemented in a larger optical circuit. We introduce suitable fidelity measures which account for these changes, and find that high values can still be achieved even when accounting for all properties of the scattered photonic state.

comments: 5 pages, 4 figures; additional 8 pages of supplemental material
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04792
abstract: We identify a key difference between discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks in search, that the former is typically restricted to one walk step per oracle query, whereas the latter can take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting query time. As a result, we show that continuous-time quantum walks can outperform their discrete-time counterparts, even though both achieve quadratic speedups over their corresponding classical random walks. To provide greater equity, we allow the discrete-time quantum walk to also take multiple walk steps per oracle query while only counting queries. Then it matches the continuous-time algorithm's runtime, but such that it is a cubic speedup over its corresponding classical random walk. This yields the first example of a greater-than-quadratic speedup for quantum search over its corresponding classical random walk.

abstract: The squash operation, or the squashing model, is a useful mathematical tool for proving the security of quantum key distribution systems using practical (i.e., non-ideal) detectors. At the present, however, this method can only be applied to a limited class of detectors, such as the threshold detector of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 type. In this paper, we generalize this method to include multi-partite measurements, and show how it can be applied to a wider class of detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this generalization by applying it to the security proof of the Ekert 1991 protocol using any memoryless detectors. The result is that the Ekert 1991 protocol achieves the device-independent security, and simultaneously the same high key generation rate as in the implementation using ideal qubit detectors. For proving this result we use two physical assumptions, namely, that quantum mechanics is valid, and that Alice's and Bob's detectors are memoryless.

abstract: Like concurrence, negativity reflects the monogamous nature of entanglement among multiple qubits. Both satisfy a linear inequality involving a party's entanglement with other parties. We show that negativity only saturates the inequality in trivial cases, and we derive a generally tight, higher order polynomial inequality. Our methods then shed light on the shareability of negativity in larger systems.

abstract: We propose a scheme by using the feed-forward control (FFC) to realize a better effect of discrimination of two nonorthogonal states after passing a noise channel based on the minimum- error (ME) discrimination. We show that the application of our scheme can highly improve the effect of discrimination compared with the ME discrimination without the FFC for any pair of nonorthogonal states and any degree of amplitude damping (AD). Especially, the effect of our optimal discrimination can reach that of the two initial nonorthogonal pure states in the presence of the noise channel in a deterministic way for equal a prior probabilities or even be better than that in a probabilistically way for unequal a prior probabilities.

abstract: We propose a new solvable one dimensional complex PT-symmetric potential as $V(x)= ig~ \mbox{sgn}(x)~ |1-\exp(2|x|/a)|$ and study the spectrum of $H=-d^2/dx^2+V(x)$. For smaller values of $a,g <1$, there are a finite number of real discrete eigenvalues. As $a$ and $g$ increase there exist exceptional points (EPs), $g_n$ (for fixed values of $a$) causing a scarcity of real discrete eigenvalues, but there exists at least one. We also show these real discrete eigenvalues as poles of reflection coefficient. We find that the energy-eigenstates $\psi_n(x)$ satisfy (1): PT$\psi_n(x)=1 \psi_n(x)$ and (2): PT$\psi_{E_n}(x)=\psi_{E^*_n}(x)$, for real and complex energy-eigenvalues, respectively. The former is well known but the latter one has been generally missed out. Here, we prove this and also illustrate it in two more exactly solvable models.

The increment of path predictability can directly be associated with stronger decoherence process. We have also theoretically predicted that placing two detectors in both the paths, which are at the same equilibrium temperature with the system, erases all the memory of path information and hence acts like a quantum eraser.

abstract: We give a theoretical study of a double-cavity system in which a mechanical resonator beam is coupled to two cavity modes on both sides through radiation pressures. The indirect coupling between the cavities via the resonator sets up a correlation in the optomechanical entanglements between the two cavities with the common resonator. This correlation initiates an entanglement transfer from the intracavity photon-phonon entanglements to an intercavity photon-photon entanglement. Using numerical solutions, we show two distinct regimes of the optomechanical system, in which the indirect entanglement either builds up and eventually saturates or undergoes a death-and-revival cycle, after a time lapse for initiating the cooperative motion of the left and right cavity modes.

abstract: A robustness measure for incompatibility of quantum devices in the lines of the robustness of entanglement is proposed. The concept of general robustness measures is first introduced in general convex-geometric settings and these ideas are then applied to measure how incompatible a given pair of quantum devices is. The robustness of quantum incompatibility is calculated in three special cases: a pair of Fourier-coupled rank-1 sharp observables, a pair of decodable channels, where decodability means left-invertibility by a channel, and a pair consisting of a rank-1 sharp observable and a decodable channel.

With the model we present a scheme to produce Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like (GHZ-like) spatial correlation with classical light, and show that the third-order spatial correlation of the thermal light has the aspect similar to the W states.

abstract: We show how to construct loss-tolerant linear steering inequalities using a generic set of von Neumann measurements that are violated by $d$-dimensional states, and that rely only upon a simple property of the set of measurements used (the maximal overlap between measurement directions). Using these inequalities we show that the critical detection efficiency above which $n$ von Neumann measurements can demonstrate steering is $1/n$. We show furthermore that using our construction and high dimensional states allows for steering demonstrations which are also highly robust to depolarising noise. Finally, our results provide an explicit means to certify the non-joint measurability of any set of inefficient von Neuman measurements.

abstract: The key requirement for harnessing the quantum properties of light is the capability to detect and count individual photons. Of particular interest are photon-number-resolving detectors, which allow one to determine whether a state of light is classical or genuinely quantum. Existing schemes for addressing this challenge rely on a proportional conversion of photons to electrons. As such, they are capable of correctly characterizing small photon fluxes, yet are limited by uncertainties in the conversion rate. In this work, we employ a divide-and-conquer approach to overcome these limitations by transforming the incident fields into uniform distributions that readily lend themselves for characterization by standard on-off detectors. Since the exact statistics of the light stream are obtained from the click statistics, our technique is freely scalable to accommodate - in principle - arbitrarily large photon fluxes. Our experiments pave the way towards genuine integrated photon-number-resolving detectors for advanced on-chip photonic quantum networks.

abstract: The speed of light in vacuum is one of the most important and most precisely measured natural constants. It determines the metric of flat space-time, presents an upper bound to the speed of all matter and information with respect to any inertial reference frame in the Universe, and plays a crucial role for applications such as satellite-based navigation systems. Its value is fixed by convention to the value $c=299 792 458$ m/s. However, advanced theories predict possible deviations from this universal value, or even quantum fluctuations of $c$. Combining arguments from quantum parameter estimation theory and general relativity, we here establish rigorously the existence of lower bounds on the precision to which the speed of light can be determined $in$ $principle$.

abstract: In the context of bipartite bosonic systems, two notions of classicality of correlations can be defined: P-classicality, based on the properties of the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function; and C-classicality, based on the entropic quantum discord. It has been shown that these two notions are maximally inequivalent in a static (metric) sense -- as they coincide only on a set of states of zero measure. We extend and reinforce quantitatively this inequivalence by addressing the dynamical relation between these types of non-classicality in a paradigmatic quantum-optical setting: the linear mixing at a beam splitter of a single-mode Gaussian state with a thermal reference state. Specifically, we show that almost all P-classical input states generate outputs that are not C-classical. Indeed, for the case of zero thermal reference photons, the more P-classical resources at the input the less C-classicality at the output. In addition, we show that the P-classicality at the input -- as quantified by the non-classical depth -- does instead determine quantitatively the potential of generating output entanglement. This endows the non-classical depth with a new operational interpretation: it gives the maximum number of thermal reference photons that can be mixed at a beam splitter without destroying the output entanglement.

abstract: We have shown in previous work that the rigorous equivalence of the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures requires that one uses Born-Jordan quantization in place of Weyl quantization. It also turns out that the so-called Dahl-Springborg angular momentum dilemma disappears if one uses Born--Jordan quantization. These two facts strongly suggest that the latter is the only true quantization procedure, and this leads to a redefinition of phase space quantum mechanics, where the usual Wigner distribution has to be replaced with a new distribution.

abstract: Coherent states (CS) were first introduced and studied in detail for bound motion and discrete-spectrum systems like harmonic oscillators and similar systems with a quadratic Hamiltonian. However, the problem of constructing CS has still not been investigated in detail for the simplest and physically important case of a free particle, for which, besides being physically important, the CS problem is of didactic value in teaching quantum mechanics, with the CS regarded as examples of wave packets representing semiclassical motion. In this paper, we essentially follow the Malkin-Dodonov-Man'ko method to construct the CS of a free nonrelativistic particle. We give a detailed discussion of the properties of the CS obtained, in particular, the completeness relations, the minimization of uncertainty relations, and the evolution of the corresponding probability density. We describe the physical conditions under which free-particle CS can be considered semiclassical states.

abstract: Traditionally, quantum amplification limit refers to the property of inevitable noise addition on canonical variables when the field amplitude of an unknown state is linearly transformed through a quantum channel. Recent theoretical studies have determined amplification limits for cases of probabilistic quantum channels or general quantum operations by specifying a set of input states or a state ensemble. However, it remains open how much excess noises on canonical variables are unavoidable and whether there exists a fundamental trade-off relations between the canonical pair in a general amplification process. In this paper we present an uncertainty-product form of amplification limits for general quantum operations by assuming an input ensemble of Gaussian distributed coherent states. It is simply derived from canonical uncertainty relations and retrieves basic properties of the traditional amplification limit. In addition, our amplification limit turns out to give a physical limitation on probabilistic reduction of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen uncertainty. In this regard, we find a condition that probabilistic amplifiers can be regarded as local filtering operations to distill entanglement. It establishes a clear benchmark to verify an advantage of non-Gaussian operations beyond Gaussian operations with a feasible input set of coherent states and standard homodyne measurements.

abstract: In [11], Newton da Costa together with the author of this paper argued in favor of the possibility to consider quantum superpositions in terms of a paraconsistent approach. We claimed that, even though most interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) attempt to escape contradictions, there are many hints that indicate it could be worth while to engage in a research of this kind. Recently, Arenhart and Krause [1, 2, 3] have raised several arguments against this approach and claimed that, taking into account the square of opposition, quantum superpositions are better understood in terms of contrariety propositions rather than contradictory propositions. In [17] we defended the Paraconsistent Approach to Quantum Superpositions (PAQS) and provided arguments in favor of its development. In the present paper we attempt to analyze the meanings of modality, potentiality and contradiction in QM, and provide further arguments of why the PAQS is better suited, than the Contrariety Approach to Quantum Superpositions (CAQS) proposed by Arenhart and Krause, to face the interpretational questions that quantum technology is forcing us to consider.

abstract: Entanglement polytopes result in finitely many types of entanglement that can be detected by only measuring single-particle spectra. With high probability, however, the local spectra lie in more than one polytope, hence providing no information about the entanglement type. To overcome this problem, we propose to additionally use local filters. We experimentally demonstrate the detection of entanglement polytopes in a four-qubit system. Using local filters we can distinguish the entanglement type of states with the same single particle spectra, but which belong to different polytopes.

abstract: It is known that a semi-classical analysis is not always adequate for atomtronics devices, but that a fully quantum analysis is often necessary to make reliable predictions. While small numbers of atoms at a small number of sites are tractable using the density matrix, a fully quantum analysis is often not straightforward as the system becomes larger. We show that the fully quantum positive-P representation is then a viable calculational tool. We postulate an atomtronic phase-gate consisting of four wells in a Bose-Hubbard configuration, for which the semi-classical dynamics are controllable using the phase of the atomic mode in one of the wells. We show that the quantum predictions of the positive-P representation for the performance of this device have little relation to those found semi-classically, and that the performance depends markedly on the actual quantum states of the initially occupied modes. We find that initial coherent states lead to closest to classical dynamics, but that initial Fock states give results that are quite different. A fully quantum analysis also opens the door for deeply quantum atomtronics, in which properties such as entanglement and EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) steering become valuable technical properties of a device.

By expanding standard randomized benchmarking analysis to this experimental regime, we find that such non-exponential decays are better modeled by multiple exponential decay rates, leading to an instantaneous control fidelity for isotopically-purified-silicon MOS quantum dot qubits which can be as high as 99.9% when low-frequency noise conditions and system calibrations are favorable. These advances in qubit characterization and validation methods underpin the considerable prospects for silicon as a qubit platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

abstract: We analyze the efficacy of multiqubit W-type states as resources for quantum information. For this, we identify and generalize four-qubit W-type states. Our results show that the states can be used as resources for deterministic quantum information processing. The utility of results, however, is limited by the availability of experimental setups to perform and distinguish multiqubit measurements. We, therefore, emphasize on another protocol where two users want to establish an optimal bipartite entanglement using the partially entangled W-type states. We found that for such practical purposes, four-qubit W states can be a better resource in comparison to three-qubit W-type states. For dense coding protocol, our states can be used deterministically to send two bits of classical message by locally manipulating a single qubit.

abstract: The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we present a phase space perspective on long range double ionization in a one dimensional model of helium. The dynamics is simulated with the periodic von Neumann (PvB) method, an exact quantum method based on a lattice of phase space Gaussians. Second, we benchmark the method by comparing to the Multiconfiguration Time-dependent Hartree method. The PvB approach is found to be faster than the standard MCTDH code for the dynamics calculations and to give better accuracy control.

abstract: We present a classical linear response theory for a magneto-dielectric material and determine the polariton dispersion relations. The electromagnetic field fluctuation spectra are obtained and polariton sum rules for their optical parameters are presented. The electromagnetic field for systems with multiple polariton branches is quantised in 3 dimensions and field operators are converted to 1-dimensional forms appropriate for parallel light beams. We show that the field-operator commutation relations agree with previous calculations that ignored polariton effects. The Abraham (kinetic) and Minkowski (canonical) momentum operators are introduced and their corresponding single-photon momenta are identified. The commutation relations of these and of their angular analogues support the identification, in particular, of the Minkowski momentum with the canonical momentum of the light. We exploit the Heaviside-Larmor symmetry of Maxwell's equations to obtain, very directly, the Einsetin-Laub force density for action on a magneto-dielectric. The surface and bulk contributions to the radiation pressure are calculated for the passage of an optical pulse into a semi-infinite sample.

abstract: We investigate ways to optimize adiabaticity and diabaticity in the Landau-Zener model with non-uniform sweeps. We show how diabaticity can be engineered with a pulse consisting of a linear sweep augmented by an oscillating term. We show that the oscillation leads to jumps in populations whose value can be accurately modeled using a model of multiple, photon-assisted Landau-Zener transitions, which generalizes work by Wubs et al. [New J. Phys. 7, 218 (2005)]. We extend the study on diabaticity using methods derived from optimal control. We also show how to preserve adiabaticity with optimal pulses at limited time, finding a non-uniform quantum speed limit.

abstract: By building on the work in Kuzmak & Tkachuk, "Preparation of quantum states of two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of the Schmidt decomposition", Physics Letters A, {\bf 378}, pp1469-1474, which outlined the control of the degree of entanglement within this system, it is proven that any $SU(4)$ state manipulation operator can be realised for this system using a sequence of pulsed magnetic fields in either two linearly independent directions if the gyromagnetic ratios are unequal or three directions for equal gyromagnetic ratios. To achieve this goal, an elementary Lie theoretic proof of the fact that the group of transformations generated by finite products of exponentials of a set of Lie algebra vectors is equal to the Lie group generated by the smallest Lie algebra containing those vectors is rewritten into an explicit algorithm. A numerical example as well as the proof of the algorithm's effectiveness is given.

abstract: Unextendible sets of Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) are examined from the point of view of complementary subalgebras. We show, that the linear span of less than $d+1$ factors of $M_d \otimes M_d$ does not contain pure states, and therefore some complementary decompositions give rise to undextendable sets of MUBs. We provide some new complementary decompositions, and thus prove strong unextendibility of some set of MUBs.

abstract: A study of highly symmetric site-controlled Pyramidal In0.25Ga0.75As quantum dots (QDs) is presented. It is discussed that polarization-entangled photons can be also obtained from Pyramidal QDs of different designs from the one already reported in Juska et al. (Nat. Phot. 7, 527, 2013). Moreover, some of the limitations for a higher density of entangled photon emitters are addressed. Among these issues are (1) a remaining small fine-structure splitting and (2) an effective QD charging under non-resonant excitation conditions, which strongly reduce the number of useful biexciton-exciton recombination events. A possible solution of the charging problem is investigated exploiting a dual-wavelength excitation technique, which allows a gradual QD charge tuning from strongly negative to positive and, eventually, efficient detection of entangled photons from QDs, which would be otherwise ineffective under a single-wavelength (non-resonant) excitation.

We show how starting from QMDS codes of length $q^2+1$ based on cyclic and constacyclic codes, new QMDS codes can be obtained by shortening. We provide numerical evidence for our conjecture that almost all admissible lengths, from a lower bound $n_0(q,d)$ on, are achievable by shortening. Some additional codes that fill gaps in the list of achievable lengths are presented as well along with a construction of a family of QMDS codes of length $q^2+2$, where $q=2^m$, that appears to be new.

abstract: We study the feasibility of the quantum-fidelity approach in studies of quantum-critical points - an alternative to standard correlation-function approach, beyond 1D. For this purpose we consider 2D models of interacting spinful fermions, examples of the so called pairing or BCS-like models, which originate from a 2D model of d-wave superconductivity proposed by Sachdev. First, due to the exact diagonalizability of the considered models in any dimensionality $D$, exact ground-state phase diagrams, with several kinds of quantum-critical points, are constructed. Closed-form analytic expressions for ground-state two-point correlation functions, with analytic expressions for their asymptotic behavior at large distances and in neighborhoods of quantum-critical points are provided. In particular, explicit expressions for direction-dependent correlation lengths and the values of direction-dependent universal critical indices $\nu$, that characterize the divergence of correlation lengths on approaching critical points, are given. Then, due to the derived analytic expressions for the ground-state quantum fidelity, critical scaling of fidelity is analyzed numerically with great accuracy, not only for small systems but also for macroscopic ones, together with the crossover region between them. The obtained results are discussed in the light of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum fidelity.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05311
abstract: In this paper we analyze the definition of quantum superpositions within orthodox Quantum Mechanics (QM) and their relation to physical reality. We will begin by discussing how the metaphysical presuppositions imposed by Bohr on the interpretation of QM have become not only interpretational dogmas which constrain the limits of the present Orthodox Line of Research (OLR), but also how these desiderata implicitly preclude the possibility of developing a physical representation of quantum superpositions. We will then continue analyzing how most interpretations of QM argue against the existence of superpositions. Firstly, we will focus on those interpretations which attempt to recover a classical representation about "what there is", and secondly, we will concentrate on the arguments provided by Dieks and Griffiths who, staying close to the orthodox formalism, also attempt to "get rid of the ghost of Schrodinger's cat". Contrary to the OLR, we will argue -based on our definition of Meaningful Physical Statements (MPS)- that from a representational realist perspective which stays close to the orthodox Hilbert space formalism, quantum superpositions are not only the key to the most important -present and future- technological and experimental developments in quantum information processing but also, they must be considered as the kernel of any interpretation of QM that attempts to provide a physical representation of reality. We will also argue that the price to pay for such representational realist development must be the abandonment of the (dogmatic) idea that 'Actuality = Reality'.

These include significant changes in the mean number of transmissions and full counting statistics, as well as "bunching" and "anti-bunching" effects in the all-particles transmission channel. With several resonances involved, pseudo-resonant driving of the two-level system in the barrier, may result in sharp enhancement of scattering probabilities for certain values of temporal delay between the particles.

abstract: The quantum capacity of a quantum channel is always smaller than the capacity of the channel for private communication. However, both quantities are given by the infinite regularization of respectively the coherent and the private information. Here, we construct a family of channels for which the private and coherent information can remain strictly superadditive for unbounded number of uses. We prove this by showing that the coherent information is strictly larger than the private information of a smaller number of uses of the channel. This implies that even though the quantum capacity is upper bounded by the private capacity, the non-regularized quantities can be interleaved. From an operational point of view, the private capacity can be used for gauging the practical value of quantum channels for secure communication and, consequently, for key distribution. We thus show that in order to evaluate the interest a channel for this task it is necessary to optimize the private information over an unlimited number of uses of the channel.

abstract: The low-temperature physics of quantum many-body systems is largely governed by the structure of their ground states. Minimizing the energy of local interactions, ground states often reflect strong properties of locality such as the area law for entanglement entropy and the exponential decay of correlations between spatially separated observables. In this letter we present a novel characterization of locality in quantum states, which we call `local reversibility'. It characterizes the type of operations that are needed to reverse the action of a general disturbance on the state. We prove that unique ground states of gapped local Hamiltonian are locally reversible. This way, we identify new fundamental features of many-body ground states, which cannot be derived from the aforementioned properties. We use local reversibility to distinguish between states enjoying microscopic and macroscopic quantum phenomena. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we prove specific properties of ground states, which are relevant both to critical and non-critical theories.

abstract: We discuss the one-dimensional, general quadratic Hamiltonian and the bi-dimensional charged particle in time-dependent electromagnetic fields through the Lie algebraic approach. Such method consists in finding a set of generators that form a closed Lie algebra in terms of which it is possible to express the Hamiltonian and the therefore the evolution operator. The evolution operator is then the starting point to obtain the propagator as well as the explicit form of the Heisenberg picture position and momentum operators. First, the set of generators forming a closed Lie algebra is identified for the general quadratic Hamiltonian. This algebra is later extended to study the the Hamiltonian of a charged particle in electromagnetic fields, given the similarities between the terms of these two Hamiltonians.

abstract: Symmetries are widely used in modeling quantum systems but they do not contribute in postulates of quantum mechanics. Here we argue that logical, mathematical, and observational evidence require that symmetry should be considered as a fundamental concept in the construction of physical systems. Based on this idea, we propose a series of postulates for describing quantum systems, and establish their relation and correspondence with axioms of standard quantum mechanics. Through some examples we show that this reformulation helps better understand some of ambiguities of standard description. Nonetheless its application is not limited to explaining confusing concept and it may be a necessary step toward a consistent model of quantum cosmology and gravity.

abstract: An interaction free evolving state of a closed bipartite system composed of two interacting subsystems is a generally mixed state evolving as if the interaction were a c-number. In this paper we find the characteristic equation of states possessing similar properties for a bipartite systems governed by a linear dynamical equation whose generator is sum of a free term and an interaction term. In particular in the case of a small system coupled to its environment, we deduce the characteristic equation of decoherence free states namely mixed states evolving as if the interaction term were effectively inactive. Several examples illustrate the applicability of our theory in different physical contexts.

abstract: Nonclassical properties of correlations-- like unpredictability, no-cloning and uncertainty-- are known to follow from two assumptions: nonlocality and no-signaling. For two-input-two-output correlations, we derive these properties from a single, unified assumption: namely, the excess of the communication cost over the signaling in the correlation. This is relevant to quantum temporal correlations, resources to simulate quantum correlations and extensions of quantum mechanics. We generalize in the context of such correlations the nonclassicality result for nonlocal-nonsignaling correlations (Masanes, Acin and Gisin, 2006) and the uncertainty bound on nonlocality (Oppenheim and Wehner, 2010), when the no-signaling condition is relaxed. An analogy of nonclassicality with G\"odel incompleteness is suggested, motivated by the expectation that quantum unpredictability is somehow comparable with metamathematical undecidability. This line of research could shed light on why randomness may be inevitable in Nature.

abstract: In a recent paper Griffiths [38] has argued, based on the consistent histories interpretation, that Hilbert space quantum mechanics (QM) is noncontextual. According to Griffiths the problem of contextuality disappears if the apparatus is "designed and operated by a competent experimentalist" and we accept the Single Framework Rule (SFR). We will argue from a representational realist stance that the conclusion is incorrect due to the misleading understanding provided by Griffiths to the meaning of quantum contextuality and its relation to physical reality and measurements. We will discuss how the quite general incomprehension of contextuality has its origin in the "objective-subjective omelette" created by Heisenberg and Bohr. We will argue that in order to unscramble the omelette we need to disentangle, firstly, representational realism from naive realism, secondly, ontology from epistemology, and thirdly, the different interpretational problems of QM. In this respect, we will analyze what should be considered as Meaningful Physical Statements (MPS) within a theory and will argue that Counterfactual Reasoning (CR) -considered by Griffiths as "tricky"- must be accepted as a necessary condition for any representational realist interpretation of QM. Finally we discuss what should be considered as a problem (and what not) in QM from a representational realist perspective.

In particular, scalar and vector fields, as well as the representations of their transformations, are constructed. The method that is developed here admits the construction of wave packets and states of a many body relativistic system with definite total angular momentum. It also an admits interpretation of particles with arbitrary integer and half-integer spin as composed of fundamental particles of spin 1/2 in a manifestly covariant way.

Formulas for a Wigner function of a wave function being a product of functions and a superposition of functions are proposed. Properties of a Wigner function of interfering states are investigated. An example of the semiclassical approximation in deformation quantisation is analysed.

abstract: The preparation of the stationary distribution of irreducible, time-reversible Markov chains is a fundamental building block in many heuristic approaches to algorithmically hard problems. It has been conjectured that quantum analogs of classical mixing processes may offer a generic quadratic speed-up in realizing such stationary distributions. Such a speed-up would also imply a speed-up of a broad family of heuristic algorithms. However, a true quadratic speed up has thus far only been demonstrated for special classes of Markov chains. These results often presuppose a regular structure of the underlying graph of the Markov chain, and also a regularity in the transition probabilities. In this work, we demonstrate a true quadratic speed-up for a class of Markov chains where the restriction is only on the form of the stationary distribution, rather than directly on the Markov chain structure itself. In particular, we show efficient mixing can be achieved when it is beforehand known that the distribution is monotonically decreasing relative to a known order on the state space. Following this, we show that our approach extends to a wider class of distributions, where only a fraction of the shape of the distribution is known to be monotonic. Our approach is built on the Szegedy-type quantization of transition operators.

We develop strategies to assert the Markovianity of the problem, the effective qubit-qubit interactions and their individual and collective spontaneous emission. We prove the existence of collective Lamb-shifts that affect the qubit-qubit interactions and the dependency of coherent and incoherent interactions on the qubit separation. We also develop the scattering theory associated to these models and prove single photon spectroscopy does probes the renormalized resonances of the single- and multi-qubit models, in sharp contrast with earlier toy models where individual and collective Lamb shifts cancel.

abstract: Coupling to a thermal bath leads to thermalisation and decoherence of stored quantum information. For a system of Gaussian fermions, the fermionic analog of linear or Gaussian optics, these dynamics can be elegantly and efficiently described by evolution of the system's covariance matrix. Taking both system and bath to be Gaussian fermionic, we observe that thermalization and decoherence occurs at a rate that is independent of the bath temperature. Furthermore, we also consider a weak coupling regime where the dynamics are Markovian. We present a microscopic derivation of Markovian master equations entirely in the language of covariance matrices, where temperature independence remains manifest. This is radically different from behaviour seen in other scenarios, such as when fermions interact with a bosonic bath. Our analysis applies to many Majorana fermion systems that have been heralded as very robust, topologically protected, qubits. In these systems, it has been claimed that thermal decoherence can be exponentially suppressed by reducing temperature, but we find Gaussian decoherence cannot be cooled away.

abstract: We investigate linear maps between matrix algebras that remain positive under tensor powers, i.e., under tensoring with $n$ copies of themselves. Completely positive and completely co-positive maps are trivial examples of this kind. We show that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exist non-trivial maps with this property and that for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces there is no non-trivial map for which this holds for all $n$. For higher dimensions we reduce the existence question of such non-trivial "tensor-stable positive maps" to a one-parameter family of maps and show that an affirmative answer would imply the existence of NPPT bound entanglement. As an application we show that any tensor-stable positive map that is not completely positive yields an upper bound on the quantum channel capacity, which for the transposition map gives the well-known cb-norm bound. We furthermore show that the latter is an upper bound even for the LOCC-assisted quantum capacity, and that moreover it is a strong converse rate for this task.

abstract: We present a theoretical method to study driven-dissipative correlated systems on lattices with two spatial dimensions (2D). The steady-state density-matrix of the lattice is obtained by solving the master equation in a corner of the Hilbert space. The states spanning the corner space are determined through an iterative procedure, using eigenvectors of the density-matrix of smaller lattice systems, merging in real space two lattices at each iteration and selecting M pairs of states by maximizing their joint probability. Accuracy of the results is then improved by increasing M, the number of states of the corner space, until convergence is reached. We demonstrate the efficiency of such an approach by applying it to the driven-dissipative 2D Bose-Hubbard model, describing, e.g., lattices of coupled cavities with quantum optical nonlinearities.

All of them have explanations in terms of $local$ interactions of gauge-$dependent$ quantities; in addition, some have explanations in terms of $nonlocal$ interactions of gauge-$invariant$ quantities. We claim, however, that two of our examples have no gauge-invariant explanation and that electromagnetic $potentials$ are, in general, truly indispensable.

abstract: Scaling-up from prototype systems to dense arrays of ions on chip, or vast networks of ions connected by photonic channels, will require developing entirely new technologies that combine miniaturized ion trapping systems with devices to capture, transmit and detect light, while refining how ions are confined and controlled. Building a cohesive ion system from such diverse parts involves many challenges, including navigating materials incompatibilities and undesired coupling between elements. Here, we review our recent efforts to create scalable ion systems incorporating unconventional materials such as graphene and indium tin oxide, integrating devices like optical fibers and mirrors, and exploring alternative ion loading and trapping techniques.

abstract: Quantum tunneling, a phenomenon in which a quantum state traverses energy barriers above the energy of the state itself, has been hypothesized as an advantageous physical resource for optimization. Here we show that multiqubit tunneling plays a computational role in a currently available, albeit noisy, programmable quantum annealer. We develop a non-perturbative theory of open quantum dynamics under realistic noise characteristics predicting the rate of many-body dissipative quantum tunneling. We devise a computational primitive with 16 qubits where quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global minimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that quantum tunneling can outperform thermal hopping along classical paths for problems with up to 200 qubits containing the computational primitive. Our results indicate that many-body quantum phenomena could be used for finding better solutions to hard optimization problems.

abstract: Steering is one of the most counter intuitive non classical features of bipartite quantum system, first noticed by Schr\"odinger at the early days of quantum theory. On the other hand measurement incompatibility is another non classical feature of quantum theory, initially pointed out by N. Bohr. Recently the authors of Refs. [\href{this http URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 113}, 160402 (2014)}] and [\href{this http URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 113}, 160403 (2014)}] have investigated the relation between these two distinct non classical features. They have shown that a set of measurements is not jointly measurable (i.e. incompatible) if and only if they can be used for demonstrating Schr\"odinger-Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. The concept of steering has been generalized for more general abstract tensor product theories rather than just Hilbert space quantum mechanics. In this article we discuss that the notion of measurement incompatibility can be extended for general probability theories. Further we show that the connection between steering and measurement incompatibility holds in a border class of tensor product theories rather than just quantum theory.

abstract: The informational power of a quantum measurement is the maximum amount of classical information that the measurement can extract from any ensemble of quantum states. We discuss its main properties. Informational power is an additive quantity, being equivalent to the classical capacity of a quantum-classical channel. The informational power of a quantum measurement is the maximum of the accessible information of a quantum ensemble that depends on the measurement. We present some examples where the symmetry of the measurement allows to analytically derive its informational power.

abstract: We address the problem of quantum reading of optical memories, namely the retrieving of classical information stored in the optical properties of a media with minimum energy. We present optimal strategies for ambiguous and unambiguous quantum reading of unitary optical memories, namely when one's task is to minimize the probability of errors in the retrieved information and when perfect retrieving of information is achieved probabilistically, respectively. A comparison of the optimal strategy with coherent probes and homodyne detection shows that the former saves orders of magnitude of energy when achieving the same performances. Experimental proposals for quantum reading which are feasible with present quantum optical technology are reported.

abstract: We present a general framework for contextuality tests in phase space using displacement operators. First, we derive a general condition that a single-mode displacement operator should fulfill in order to construct Peres-Mermin square and similar scenarios. This approach offers a straightforward scheme for experimental implementations of the tests via modular variable measurements. In addition to the continuous variable case, our condition can be also applied to finite-dimensional systems in discrete phase space, using Heisenberg-Weyl operators. This approach, therefore, offers a unified picture of contextuality with a geometric flavor.

abstract: We study teleportation with identical massive particles. Indistinguishability imposes that the relevant degrees of freedom to be teleported are not particles, but rather addressable orthogonal modes. We discuss the performances of teleportation under the constraint of conservation of the total number of particles. The latter inevitably decreases the teleportation fidelity. Moreover, even though a phase reference, given by the coupling to a reservoir, circumverts the constraint, it does not restore perfect deterministic teleportation. The latter is only achievable with some special resource entangled states and when the number of particles tends to infinity. Interestingly, some of such states are the many-particle atomic coherent states and the ground state of cold atoms loaded into a double well potential, which are routinely prepared in experiments.

abstract: Quantum coherence is an essential ingredient in quantum information processing and plays a central role in emergent fields such as nanoscale thermodynamics and quantum biology. However, our understanding and quantitative characterization of coherence as an operational resource are still very limited. Here we show that all quantum states displaying coherence in some reference basis are useful resources for the creation of entanglement via incoherent operations. This finding allows us to define a novel general class of measures of coherence for a quantum system of arbitrary dimension, in terms of the maximum bipartite entanglement that can be created via incoherent operations applied to the system and an incoherent ancilla. The resulting measures are proven to be valid coherence monotones satisfying all the requirements dictated by the resource theory of quantum coherence. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by proving that the fidelity-based geometric measure of coherence is a full convex coherence monotone, and deriving a closed formula for it on arbitrary single-qubit states. Our work provides a clear quantitative and operational connection between coherence and entanglement, two landmark manifestations of quantum theory and both key enablers for quantum technologies.

abstract: Randomness is fundamental in quantum theory, with many philosophical and practical implications. In this paper we discuss the concept of algorithmic randomness, which provides a quantitative method to assess the Borel normality of a given sequence of numbers, a necessary condition for it to be considered random. We use Borel normality as a tool to investigate the randomness of ten sequences of bits generated from the differences between detection times of photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric downconversion. These sequences are shown to fulfil the randomness criteria without difficulties. As deviations from Borel normality for photon-generated random number sequences have been reported in previous work, a strategy to understand these diverging findings is outlined.

abstract: We study the spreading of correlations and other physical quantities in quantum lattice models with interactions or hopping decaying like $r^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $r$. Our focus is on exponents $\alpha$ between 0 and 6, where the interplay of long- and short-range features gives rise to a complex phenomenology and interesting physical effects, and which is also the relevant range for experimental realizations with cold atoms, ions, or molecules. We present analytical and numerical results, providing a comprehensive picture of spatio-temporal propagation. Lieb-Robinson-type bounds are extended to strongly long-range interactions where $\alpha$ is smaller than the lattice dimension, and we report particularly sharp bounds that are capable of reproducing regimes with soundcone as well as supersonic dynamics. Complementary lower bounds prove that faster-than-soundcone propagation occurs for $\alpha<2$ in any spatial dimension, although cone-like features are shown to also occur in that regime. Our results provide guidance for optimizing experimental efforts to harness long-range interactions in a variety of quantum information and signaling tasks.

For the limit of weak pumping an expression for the joint spectral intensity of generated photon pairs, as well as the singles-to-coincidences ratio, is derived.

abstract: Tunnel ionization belongs to the fundamental processes of atomic physics. The so-called two-step model, which describes the ionization as instantaneous tunneling at electric field maximum and classical motion afterwards, is commonly employed to describe tunnel ionization in adiabatic regimes. In this contribution, we first show by solving numerically the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension that there is a time delay between the electric field maximum and the maximum of the ionization rate. This delay is identified as the response time needed by the wavefunction to react to the field maximum. Furthermore, there is a difference between the quantum momentum and the classical momentum from the two-step model after interaction with the driving electric field. Combining both results, we conclude that the electron has an effective initial momentum at the tunneling exit. Our results imply that the two-step model needs modification. The electron's initial momentum has to be incorporated, when tunneling times shall be determined in attoclock experiments.

abstract: The implementation of a three-level Lambda System in artificial atoms would allow to perform advanced control tasks typical of quantum optics in the solid state realm, with photons in the $\mathrm{\mu m}$/mm range. However hardware constraints put an obstacle since protection from decoherence is often conflicting with efficient coupling to external fields. We address the problem of performing conventional STImulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) in the presence of low-frequency noise. We propose two strategies to defeat decoherence, based on "optimal symmetry breaking" and dynamical decoupling. We suggest how to apply to the different implementations of superconducting artificial atoms, stressing the key role of non-Markovianity.

abstract: In 1861, Maxwell derived two of his equations of electromagnetism by modelling a magnetic line of force as a `molecular vortex' in a fluid-like medium. Later, in 1980, Berry and colleagues conducted experiments on a `phase vortex', a wave geometry in a fluid which is analogous to a magnetic line of force and also exhibits behaviour corresponding to the quantisation of magnetic flux. Here we unify these approaches by writing down a solution to the equations of motion for a compressible fluid which behaves in the same way as a magnetic line of force. We then revisit Maxwell's historical inspiration, namely Faraday's 1846 model of light as disturbances in lines of force. Using our unified model, we show that such disturbances resemble photons: they are polarised, absorbed discretely, obey Maxwell's full equations of electromagnetism to first order, and quantitatively reproduce the correlation that is observed in the Bell tests.

abstract: There are two distinct techniques of proven effectiveness for extending the coherence lifetime of spin qubits in environments of other spins. One is dynamical decoupling, whereby the qubit is subjected to a carefully timed sequence of control pulses; the other is tuning the qubit towards 'optimal working points' (OWPs), which are sweet-spots for reduced decoherence in magnetic fields. By means of quantum many-body calculations, we investigate the effects of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences far from and near OWPs for a central donor qubit subject to decoherence from a nuclear spin bath. Key to understanding the behavior is to analyse the degree of suppression of the usually dominant contribution from independent pairs of flip-flopping spins within the many-body quantum bath. We find that to simulate recently measured Hahn echo decays at OWPs (lowest-order dynamical decoupling), one must consider clusters of three interacting spins, since independent pairs do not even give finite $T_2$ decay times. We show that while operating near OWPs, dynamical decoupling sequences require hundreds of pulses for a single order of magnitude enhancement of $T_2$, in contrast to regimes far from OWPs, where only about ten pulses are required.

Among these, the Dynamical Reduction Models possess the unique characteristic to be experimentally testable, thus enabling to set experimental upper bounds on the reduction rate parameter $\lambda$ characterizing these models. Analysing the X-ray spectrum emitted by an isolated slab of Germanium, we set the most stringent limit on the parameter $\lambda$ up to date.

These results extend the previous many-body selective coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT) schemes for nondipolar bosons in double-well potentials[Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 133002 (2009); Phys. Rev. A 86, 044102 (2012)], thus offering an efficient way to design the long-range coherent quantum transportation.

abstract: We analyze the design of a potential replacement technology for the commercial ferrite circulators that are ubiquitous in contemporary quantum superconducting microwave experiments. The lossless, lumped element design is capable of being integrated on chip with other superconducting microwave devices, thus circumventing the many performance-limiting aspects of ferrite circulators. The design is based on the dynamic modulation of DC superconducting microwave quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) that function as nearly linear, tunable inductors. The connection to familiar ferrite-based circulators is a simple frame boost in the internal dynamics' equation of motion. In addition to the general, schematic analysis, we also give an overview of many considerations necessary to achieve a practical design with a tunable center frequency in the 4-8 GHz frequency band, a bandwidth of 240 MHz, reflections at the -20 dB level, and a maximum signal power of approximately order 100 microwave photons per inverse bandwidth.

The main result of the paper is a general connection between the $N$-photon S matrix and the Green functions of the local system. We also show that the computation can be significantly simplified, by exploiting the connectedness structure of both the S matrix and the Green function, and by computing the Green function using an effective Hamiltonian that involves only the degrees of freedom of the local system. We illustrate our formalism by computing $N$-photon transport through a cavity containing a medium with Kerr nonlinearity, with $N$ up to 3.

abstract: Macroscopic ensembles of radiating dipoles are ubiquitous in the physical and natural sciences. In the classical limit the dipoles can be described as damped-driven oscillators, which are able to spontaneously synchronize and collectively lock their phases. Here we investigate the correspond- ing phenomenon in the quantum regime with arrays of quantized two-level systems coupled via long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions. Our calculations demonstrate that the dipoles may overcome the decoherence induced by quantum fluctuations and inhomogeneous couplings and evolve to a synchronized steady-state. This steady-state bears much similarity to that observed in classical systems, and yet also exhibits genuine quantum properties such as quantum correlations and quan- tum phase diffusion (reminiscent of lasing). Our predictions could be relevant for the development of better atomic clocks and a variety of noise tolerant quantum devices.

abstract: Quantum systems with a non-conserved probability can be described by means of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and non-unitary dynamics. In this paper, the case in which the degrees of freedom can be partitioned in two subsets with light and heavy masses is treated. A classical limit over the heavy coordinates is taken in order to embed the non-unitary dynamics of the subsystem in a classical environment. Such a classical environment, in turn, acts as an additional source of dissipation (or noise), beyond that represented by the non-unitary evolution. The non-Hermitian dynamics of a Heisenberg two-spin chain, with the spins independently coupled to classical-like harmonic oscillators, is considered in order to illustrate the formalism.

We discuss the properties of these gauge transformations and introduce a special Liouville gauge which allows one to map the problem of quantum reflection of an atom on an attractive Casimir-Polder well into that of reflection on a repulsive wall. We deduce a quantitative evaluation of quantum reflection probabilities in terms of the universal probability which corresponds to the solution of the $V_4=-C_4/z^4$ far-end Casimir-Polder potential.

abstract: In this paper we study an archetypical scenario in which repulsive Casimir-Polder forces between an atom or molecule and two macroscopic bodies can be achieved. This is an extension of previous studies of the interaction between a polarizable atom and a wedge, in which repulsion occurs if the atom is sufficiently anisotropic and close enough to the symmetry plane of the wedge. A similar repulsion occurs if such an atom passes a thin cylinder or a wire. An obvious extension is to compute the interaction between such an atom and two facing wedges, which includes as a special case the interaction of an atom with a conducting screen possessing a slit, or between two parallel wires. To this end we further extend the electromagnetic multiple-scattering formalism for three-body interactions. To test this machinery we reinvestigate the interaction of a polarizable atom between two parallel conducting plates. In that case, three-body effects are shown to be small, and are dominated by three- and four-scattering terms. The atom-wedge calculation is illustrated by an analogous scalar situation, described in the Appendix. The wedge-wedge-atom geometry is difficult to analyze because this is a scale-free problem. But it is not so hard to investigate the three-body corrections to the interaction between an anisotropic atom or nanoparticle and a pair of parallel conducting cylinders, and show that the three-body effects are very small and do not affect the Casimir-Polder repulsion at large distances between the cylinders. Finally, we consider whether such highly anisotropic atoms needed for repulsion are practically realizable. Since this appears rather difficult to accomplish, it may be more feasible to observe such effects with highly anisotropic nano particles.

In fact, it is argued that in quantum mechanics clock effect arises as energy level splitting in gravitomagnetic field.

abstract: A quantum game can be viewed as a state preparation in which the final output state results from the competing preferences of the players over the set of possible output states that can be produced. It is therefore possible to view state preparation in general as being the output of some appropriately chosen (notional) quantum game. This reverse engineering approach in which we seek to construct a suitable notional game that produces some desired output state as its equilibrium state may lead to different methodologies and insights. With this goal in mind we examine the notion of preference in quantum games since if we are interested in the production of a particular equilibrium output state, it is the competing preferences of the players that determine this equilibrium state. We show that preferences on output states can be viewed in certain cases as being induced by measurement with an appropriate set of numerical weightings, or payoffs, attached to the results of that measurement. In particular we show that a distance-based preference measure on the output states is equivalent to a having a strictly-competitive set of payoffs on the results of some measurement.

abstract: In this paper we formally study the unpredictability of measurements of complementary observables, in quantum and classical mechanics. To do so, we extend a formal model of unpredictability we previously developed to allow for more nuanced, relativised notions of unpredictability, as needed for this purpose. This model of relativised unpredictability is, for instance, also well suited to the study of finite-time unpredictability in chaotic systems. We use this model to show that complementarity implies only a form of relative unpredictable: measurements of complementary observables are unpredictable for an observer unable to measure properties of a system complementary to those known for the system. However, in contrast to measurements of quantum value indefinite observables, these measurement outcomes need not be absolutely unpredictable. We further discuss the relationship between relative unpredictability and computability, and show that complementarity, again in contrast to value indefiniteness, does not guarantee incomputability - an algorithmic form of unpredictability: sequences generated by measurements of complementary observables can be computable. Finally we discuss the use of complementarity in certifying quantum randomness, arguing that it is, by itself, a fairly weak property which is unable to provide the certification that quantum value indefiniteness, via the Kochen-Specker theorem, can.

The possibility of experimental measurement of a local electric field by the level shift is analyzed.

abstract: Entangled states are in conflict with the general physical principle saying that a composite entity exists if and only if its components also exist, and therefore are in pure states. To solve this paradox one has to complete the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, by adding more pure states. We show that this can be done, in a consistent way, by using the extended Bloch representation of quantum mechanics, recently introduced to solve the measurement problem, which therefore can also be exploited to restore the full intelligibility of entangled states.

abstract: Although strongly regular graphs and the hypercube are not complete, they are "sufficiently complete" such that a randomly walking quantum particle asymptotically searches on them in the same $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ time as on the complete graph, the latter of which is precisely Grover's algorithm. We show that physically realistic nonlinearities of the form $f(|\psi|^2)\psi$ can speed up search on sufficiently complete graphs, depending on the nonlinearity and graph. Thus nonlinear (quantum) computation can retain its power even when a degree of noncompleteness is introduced.

abstract: Uncertainty principle is one of the cornerstones of quantum theory. In the literature, there are two types of uncertainty relations, the operator form concerning the variances of physical observables and the entropy form related to entropic quantities. Both these forms are inequalities involving pairwise observables, and are found to be nontrivial to incorporate multiple observables. In this work we introduce a new form of uncertainty relation which may give out complete trade-off relations for variances of observables in pure and mixed quantum systems. Unlike the prevailing uncertainty relations, which are either quantum state dependent or not directly measurable, our bounds for variances of observables are quantum state independent and immune from the "triviality" problem, the optimal ones. Furthermore, the new uncertainty relation may provide a geometric explanation for the reason why there are limitations on the simultaneous determination of different observables in $N$-dimensional Hilbert space.

abstract: The properties of the coinless quantum walk model have not been as thoroughly analyzed as those of the coined model. Both evolve in discrete time steps but the former uses a smaller Hilbert space, which is spanned merely by the site basis. Besides, the evolution operator can be obtained using a process of lattice tessellation, which is very appealing. The moments of the probability distribution play an important role in the context of quantum walks. The ballistic behavior of the mean square displacement indicates that quantum-walk-based algorithms are faster than random-walk-based ones. In this paper, we obtain analytical expressions for the moments of the coinless model on $d$-dimensional lattices. The mean square displacement for large times is explicitly calculated for the one- and two-dimensional lattices and, using optimization methods, the parameter values that give the largest spread are calculated and compared with the equivalent ones of the coined model. Although we have employed asymptotic methods, our approximations are accurate even for small numbers of time steps.

abstract: Joint measurements of non-commuting observables are characterized by unavoidable measurement uncertainties that can be described in terms of the error statistics for input states with well-defined values for the target observables. However, a complete characterization of measurement errors must include the correlations between the errors of the two observables. Here, we show that these correlations appear in the experimentally observable measurement statistics obtained by performing the joint measurement on maximally entangled pairs. For two-level systems, the results indicate that quantum theory requires imaginary correlations between the measurement errors of X and Y since these correlations are represented by the operator product XY=iZ in the measurement operators. Our analysis thus reveals a directly observable consequence of non-commutativity in the statistics of quantum measurements.

abstract: We show how it is possible to operate end-to-end relays on a QKD network by treating each relay as a trusted eavesdropper operating an intercept/resend strategy. It is shown that, by introducing the concept of bit transport, the key rate compared to that of single-link channels is unaffected. The technique of bit transport extends the capability of QKD networks. We also discuss techniques for reducing the level of trust required in the relays. In particular we demonstrate that it is possible to create a simple quantum key exchange scheme using secret sharing such that by the addition of a single extra relay on a multi-relay channel requires the eavesdropper to compromise all the relays on the channel. By coupling this with multi-path capability and asynchronous quantum key establishment we show that, in effect, an eavesdropper has to compromise all relays on an entire network and collect data on the entire network from its inception.

abstract: We study the detection capability of the weak-value amplification on the basis of the statistical hypothesis testing. We propose a reasonable testing method in the physical and statistical senses to find that the weak measurement with the large weak value has the advantage to reduce the possibility of missing the presence of interaction. Our present work overcomes the critical dilemma of the weak-value amplification that the larger the amplification is, the smaller the number of data becomes, because the statistical hypothesis testing works even for a small number of data. This is contrasted with the parameter estimation by the weak-value amplification in the literature which requires a large number of data.

abstract: The Casimir force between two parallel plates separated by anisotropic media is investigated. We theoretically calculate the Casimir force between two parallel plates when the interspace between the plates is filled with anisotropic media. Our result shows that the anisotropy of the material between the plates can significantly affect the Casimir force, especially the direction of the force. If ignoring the anisotropy of the in-between material makes the force to be repulsive (attractive), by contrast, taking the anisotropy into account may produce an extra attractive (repulsive) force. The physical explanations for these phenomenon are also discussed.

abstract: Using Kaluza-Klein theory we discuss the quantum mechanics of a particle in the background of a domain wall (brane) embedded in extra dimensions. We show that the geometric phases associated with the particle depend on the topological features of those spacetimes. Using a cohomological modeling schema, we deduce a random phase sequence composed of the geometric phases accompanying the periodic evolution over the spacetimes. The random phase sequence is demonstrated some properties that could be experimental verification. We argue that it is related to the nonlocality of quantum entanglement.

abstract: We propose a general scheme determining the quantum pointer basis of a macroscopic object interacting with environment. Requiring the best robustness of the object state gives an analytic formula for what we call pointer Hamiltonian whose eigenbasis corresponds to the pointer basis. Our pointer basis does not rely on master equations, and so is easily calculable since it has a time-local analytic formula. We show that, as a convincing example, our pointer basis gives an satisfactory answer to a macroscopic flying body such as a bullet whose pointer states should have a well-defined momentum as well as a highly-localized position. We also apply our scheme to a spring-mass system (harmonic oscillator) interacting with air molecules, and obtain a satisfactory pointer basis. Our pointer basis guarantees energy conservation before and after measurement if the measured ensemble is decomposed by our pointer basis.

abstract: Quantum interference of correlated particles is a fundamental quantum phenomenon which carries signatures of the statistics properties of the particles, such as bunching or anti-bunching. In presence of particular symmetries, interference effects take place with high visibility, one of the simplest cases being the suppression of coincident detection in the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. Tichy et al. recently demonstrated a simple sufficient criterion for the suppression of output events in the more general case of Fourier multi-port beam splitters. Here we study the case in which $2^q$ particles (either bosonic or fermionic) are injected simultaneously in different ports of a Sylvester interferometer with $2^p \geq 2^q$ modes. In particular, we prove a necessary and sufficient criterion for a significant fraction of output states to be suppressed, for specific input configurations. This may find application in assessing the indistinguishability of multiple single photon sources and in the validation of boson sampling machines.

The general condition for the occurrence of IFE is found and exploited to analyze specific situations. Several examples are presented, each one associated to a class of Hamiltonians with specific features.

abstract: Randomness is an invaluable resource in today's life with a broad use reaching from numerical simulations through randomized algorithms to cryptography. However, on the classical level no true randomness is available and even the use of simple quantum devices in a prepare-measure setting suffers from lack of stability and controllability. This gave rise to a group of quantum protocols that provide randomness certified by classical statistical tests -- Device Independent Quantum Random Number Generators. In this paper we review the most relevant results in this field, which allow the production of almost perfect randomness with help of quantum devices, supplemented with an arbitrary weak source of additional randomness. This is in fact the best one could hope for to achieve, as with no starting randomness (corresponding to no free will in a different concept) even a quantum world would have a fully deterministic description.

abstract: The quantum Rabi model describes the ultrastrong interaction of a two-level atom coupled to a single quantized bosonic mode. As compared to the Jaynes-Cummings model, in the Rabi model the absorption and emission processes do not need to satisfy energy conservation and the usual rotating wave approximation (RWA) breaks down. As a result, the atom-field dynamics in the Hilbert space splits into two independent parity chains, exhibiting a collapse-revival pattern and exact periodic dynamics in the limit of degenerate atomic levels. Here we introduce a mixed Rabi Jaynes-Cummings model by considering a three-level atom interacting with two quantized bosonic fields, in which the RWA is made for one transition (with a weak atom-field coupling) but not for the other one (with an ultrastrong atom-field coupling). As a result, we show that the field in the weak coupled atomic transition can be used as a tool to control the atom-field dynamics of the other (strong coupled) transition, thus realizing an effective two-level quantum Rabi model with a controllable field. In particular, a periodic temporal dynamics of the atom-field state can be realized by appropriate tuning of the weak control field, even for non-degenerate atomic levels. A photonic simulator of the mixed Rabi Jaynes-Cummings model, based on light transport in evanescently-coupled optical waveguide lattices, is also briefly discussed.

abstract: Focusing on the $2\mathrm{p}-1\mathrm{s}$ transition in atomic Hydrogen, we investigate through first order perturbation theory the time evolution of the survival probability of an electron initially taken to be in the excited ($2\mathrm{p}$) state. We examine both the results yielded by the standard dipole approximation for the coupling between the atom and the electromagnetic field -for which we propose a cutoff-independent regularisation- and those yielded by the exact coupling function. In both cases, Fermi's golden rule is shown to be an excellent approximation for the system at hand: we found its maximal deviation from the exact behaviour of the system to be of order $10^{-8}/10^{-7}{}$. Our treatment also yields a rigorous prescription for the choice of the optimal cutoff frequency in the dipole approximation. With our cutoff, the predictions of the dipole approximation are almost indistinguishable at all times from the exact dynamics of the system.

abstract: We investigate minimum output (R\'enyi) entropy of qubit channels and unital quantum channels. We obtain an exact formula for the minimum output entropy of qubit channels, and bounds for unital quantum channels. Interestingly, our bounds depend only on the operator norm of the matrix representation of the channels on the space of trace-less Hermitian operators. Moreover, since these bounds respect tensor products, we get bounds for the capacity of unital quantum channels, which is saturated by the Werner-Holevo channel. Furthermore, we construct an orthonormal basis, besides the Gell-Mann basis, for the space of trace-less Hermitian operators by using discrete Weyl operators. We apply our bounds to discrete Weyl covariant channels with this basis, and find new examples in which the minimum output R\'enyi $2$-entropy is additive.

abstract: It has been predicted and experimentally demonstrated that by injecting squeezed light into an optomechanical device it is possible to enhance the precision of a position measurement. Here, we present a fundamentally different approach where the squeezing is created directly inside the cavity by a nonlinear medium. Counterintuitively, the enhancement of the signal to noise ratio works by de-amplifying precisely the quadrature that is sensitive to the mechanical motion without losing quantum information. This enhancement works for systems with a weak optomechanical coupling and/or strong mechanical damping. This could allow for larger mechanical bandwidth of quantum limited detectors based on optomechanical devices. Our approach can be straightforwardly extended to Quantum Non Demolition (QND) qubit detection.

abstract: In this article, we theoretically study the quantum statistical properties of the light transmitted through or reflected from an optical cavity, filled by an atomic medium with strong optical non-linearity induced by Rydberg-Rydberg van der Waals interactions. Atoms are driven on a two-photon transition from their ground state to a Rydberg level via an intermediate state by the combination of a weak signal field and a strong control beam. By using a perturbative approach, we get analytic results which remain valid in the regime of weak feeding fields, even when the intermediate state becomes resonant. Therefore they allow us to investigate quantitatively new features associated with the resonant behaviour of the system. We also propose an effective non-linear three-boson model of the system which, in addition to leading to the same analytic results as the original problem, sheds light on the physical processes at work in the system.

abstract: Recent schemes to encode quantum information into the total angular momentum of light, defining rotation-invariant hybrid qubits composed of the polarization and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom, present interesting applications for quantum information technology. However, there remains the question as to how detrimental effects such as random spatial perturbations affect these encodings. Here, we demon- strate that alignment-free quantum communication through a turbulent channel based on hybrid qubits can be achieved with unit transmission fidelity. In our experiment, alignment-free qubits are produced with q-plates and sent through a homemade tur- bulence chamber. The decoding procedure, also realized with q-plates, relies on both degrees of freedom and renders an intrinsic error-filtering mechanism that maps errors into losses.

In this paper, we present a limit of the return probability for a discrete-time 3-state quantum walk on a hexagonal lattice.

abstract: We consider quantum metrology for unitary evolutions generated by parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. We focus on the unitary evolutions generated by the Ising Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of a one-dimensional chain of spins with nearest-neighbour interactions and in the presence of a global magnetic field. We analytically solve the problem and show that the precision with which one can estimate the magnetic field (interaction strength) given one knows the interaction strength (magnetic field) scales at the Heisenberg limit, and can be achieved by a linear superposition of the vacuum and N free fermion states. Moreover, we numerically observe that the optimal precision using a product input state scales at the standard quantum limit. In addition, we show that if, in general, we have control over part of the dynamics and wish to optimally estimate the remaining part, the best strategy is to set the dynamics under our control to zero.

abstract: Integrated optics allow the generation and control of increasingly complex photonic states on chip based architectures. Here, we implement two entangled qutrits - a 9-dimensional quantum system - and demonstrate an exceptionally high degree of experimental control. The approach which is conceptually different to common bulk optical implementations is heavily based on methods of integrated in-fiber and on-chip technologies and further motivated by methods commonly used in today's telecommunication industry. The system is composed of an in-fiber source creating entangled qutrit states of any amplitude and phase and an on-chip integrated general Multiport enabling the realization of any desired local unitary transformation within the two qutrit 9-dimensional Hilbert space. The complete design is readily extendible towards higher-dimensions with moderate increase in complexity. Ultimately, our scheme allows for complete on-chip integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our system by realizing a complete characterization of the two qutrit space of higher-order Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations.

abstract: The linear Schr\"{o}dinger equation does not predict that macroscopic bodies should be located at one place only. Quantum mechanics textbooks generally solve the problem by introducing the projection postulate, which forces definite values to emerge during position measurements; many other interpretations have also been proposed.\ Here, in the same spirit as the GRW and CSL theories, we modify the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in a way that efficiently cancels macroscopic density fluctuations in space.\ Instead of introducing the stochastic dynamics of GRW or CSL, we assume a deterministic dynamics that includes an attraction term towards the density in space of the de Broglie-Bohm position of particles. This automatically ensures macroscopic uniqueness, so that the state vector can be considered as a direct representation of physical reality.

abstract: Vast developments in quantum technology have enabled the preparation of quantum states with more than a dozen entangled qubits. The full characterization of such systems demands distinct constructions depending on their specific type and the purpose of their use. Here we present a method that scales linearly with the number of qubits for characterizing stabilizer states. Our approach allows simultaneous extraction of information about the fidelity, the entanglement, and the nonlocality of the state and thus is of high practical relevance. We demonstrate the efficient applicability of our method by performing an experimental characterization of a photonic four-qubit cluster state and three- and four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. Our scheme can be directly extended to larger-scale quantum information tasks.

abstract: Bright squeezed vacuum state generated via high-gain parametric down conversion is a valuable resource for quantum information. Its highly multiphoton and multimode structure offers a huge increase in the information capacity provided that each mode can be addressed separately. Here we demonstrate lossless filtering of a single spatial Schmidt mode by projecting the spatial spectrum of bright squeezed vacuum on the eigenmode of a single-mode fiber. Moreover, we show that the first Schmidt mode can be captured by simply maximizing the fiber-coupled intensity. Importantly, the projection operation does not affect the radiation and leaves it usable for further applications.

abstract: The core of the measurement problem, namely the problem of definite outcomes, remains unresolved. This paper shows that Josef Jauch's 1968 reduced density operator or "local state" solution is the correct answer, even though Jauch raised doubts about it at the time and many have questioned it since. In addition to Jauch's argument, a new argument based on the non-local entanglement between the measured quantum system and its measuring apparatus shows that relativity's ban on instant signaling implies the observed outcomes must be the definite local (or reduced) states. Experiments in 1990 with entangled photon pairs provide insight into the global measurement state, showing it to be a superposition only of correlations, not of quantum states. Nature's measurement strategy is to shift the superposition from the detected quantum system to the correlations between this system and its detector, allowing both system and detector to collapse locally into incoherent mixtures of definite outcomes while the global state maintains its unitary evolution. This solution implies a revision of the standard eigenvalue-eigenstate link, but this neither alters nor contradicts other quantum principles. Three frequent objections to this solution are rebutted.

abstract: Quantum heat engines (QHE) are thermal machines where the working substance is quantum. In the extreme case the working medium can be a single particle or a few level quantum system. The study of QHE has shown a remarkable similarity with the standard thermodynamical models, thus raising the issue what is quantum in quantum thermodynamics. Our main result is thermodynamical equivalence of all engine type in the quantum regime of small action. They have the same power, the same heat, the same efficiency, and they even have the same relaxation rates and relaxation modes. Furthermore, it is shown that QHE have quantum-thermodynamic signature, i.e thermodynamic measurements can confirm the presence of quantum coherence in the device. The coherent work extraction mechanism enables power outputs that greatly exceed the power of stochastic (dephased) engines.

abstract: There exists a remarkable four-qutrit state that carries absolute maximal entanglement in all its partitions. Employing this state, we construct a tensor network that delivers a holographic many body state, the H-code, where the physical properties of the boundary determine those of the bulk. This H-code is made of an even superposition of states whose relative Hamming distances are exponentially large with the size of the boundary. This property makes H-codes natural states for a quantum memory. H-codes exist on tori of definite sizes and get classified in three different sectors characterized by the sum of their qutrits on cycles wrapped through the boundaries of the system. We construct a parent Hamiltonian for the H-code which is highly non local and finally we compute the topological entanglement entropy of the H-code.

Bennet et al, in their study of quantum nonlocality without entanglement, noted the lack of LOCC (local operations and classical communication) distinguishability for a specific $3$ qubit UOB. In general, for $n$ qubits, we prove that in its natural structure as a real variety, the space of UOB is a bouquet of products of Riemann spheres parametrized by a class of edge colorings of hypercubes. Its irreducible components of maximum dimension are products of $2^n-1$ two-spheres. Using a theorem of Walgate and Hardy, we observe that the LOCC distinguishable UOB are exactly those in the maximum dimensional components.

abstract: We present a Monte Carlo wavefunction method for semiclassically modeling spin-$\frac12$ systems in a magnetic field gradient in one dimension. Our model resolves the conflict of determining what classical force an atom should be subjected to when it is in an arbitrary superposition of internal states. Spatial degrees of freedom are considered to be an environment, entanglement with which decoheres the internal states. Atoms follow classical trajectories through space, punctuated by probabilistic jumps between spin states. We modify the conventional Monte Carlo wavefunction method to jump between states when population transfer occurs, rather than when population is later discarded via exponential decay. This results in a spinor wavefunction that is continuous in time, and allows us to model the classical particle trajectories (evolution of the environment variables) more accurately. The model is not computationally demanding and it agrees well with simulations of the full spatial wavefunction of an atom.

abstract: Do correctness and completeness of quantum mechanics jointly imply that quantum state vectors are necessarily in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the physical reality? In terms of category theory, such a correspondence would stand for an isomorphism, so the problem of the status of the quantum state vector could be turned into the question of whether state vectors are necessarily isomorphic to elements of the reality. As it is argued in the present paper, in order to tackle this question, one needs to complement the category-theoretic approach to quantum mechanics with the computational-complexity-theoretic considerations. Based on such considerations, it is demonstrated in the paper that the hypothesis of the isomorphism existing between state vectors and elements of the reality is expected to be unsuitable for a generic quantum system.

abstract: We address the issue of testing experimentally the thermodynamic arrow of time by using a nuclear magnetic resonance set-up that allows for the determination of the nonequilibrium entropy produced in an isolated spin-1/2 system following fast quenches of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that the macroscopic average entropy production equals the entropic distance between a microscopic process and its time-reversal. This thus establishes a microscopic foundation of irreversibility beyond the linear response regime and both elucidates and quantifies the physical origin of the arrow of time in a quantum setting.

abstract: This chapter introduces cavity-based light-matter quantum interfaces, with a single atom or ion in strong coupling to a high-finesse optical cavity. We discuss the deterministic generation of indistinguishable single photons from these systems; the atom-photon entanglement intractably linked to this process; and the information encoding using spatio-temporal modes within these photons. Furthermore, we show how to establish a time-reversal of the aforementioned emission process to use a coupled atom-cavity system as a quantum memory. Along the line, we also discuss the performance and characterisation of cavity photons in elementary linear-optics arrangements with single beam splitters for quantum-homodyne measurements.

abstract: We present a formulation of quantum mechanics based on a logic representing some aspects of the behaviour of the measurement process. With such an approach, we make no direct mention of quantum states, and thus avoid the problems associated to this rather evasive notion. We then study some properties of the models of this logic, and deduce some characteristics that any model (and hence any formulation of quantum mechanics compatible with its prediction and relying on a notion of measurement) should verify. The main results we obtain are that in the case of a Hilbert space of dimension at least 3, no model can lead to the prediction with certainty of more than one atomic outcome. Moreover, if the Hilbert space is finite dimensional, then we are able to precisely describe the structure of the predictions of any model of our logic. As a consequence, we finally show that all the models of our logic make exactly the same predictions regarding whether a given sequence of outcomes is possible or not.

abstract: Systems of interacting quantum spins show a rich spectrum of quantum phases and display interesting many-body dynamics. Computing characteristics of even small systems on conventional computers poses significant challenges. A quantum simulator has the potential to outperform standard computers in calculating the evolution of complex quantum systems. Here, we perform a digital quantum simulation of the paradigmatic Heisenberg and Ising interacting spin models using a two transmon-qubit circuit quantum electrodynamics setup. We make use of the exchange interaction naturally present in the simulator to construct a digital decomposition of the model-specific evolution and extract its full dynamics. This approach is universal and efficient, employing only resources which are polynomial in the number of spins and indicates a path towards the controlled simulation of general spin dynamics in superconducting qubit platforms.

The scheme can be implemented in strongly coupled qubit-cavity systems and is well suited to the capabilities of state of the art superconducting circuits. The ideal analytical scheme is compared with a full simulation of the open Jaynes-Cummings model with realistic device parameters. This amplification tool can be utilized for practical quantum information processing in non-classical continuous-variable states.

authors: Daniel Bedingham, Owen Maroney
comments: 26 pages, 8 figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06830
abstract: Collapse models are modifications of quantum theory where the wave function is treated as physically real and the collapse of the wave function is a physical process. This appears to introduce a time reversal asymmetry into the dynamics of the wave function since the collapses affect only the future state. This paper challenges this conclusion, showing that in three different examples of time asymmetries associated with collapse models, if the physically real part of the model can be reduced to the locations in space and time about which collapses occur, then such a model works both forward and backward in time, in each case satisfying the Born rule. Despite the apparent asymmetry of the collapse process, these models in fact have time reversal symmetry. Any physically observed time asymmetries that arise in such models are due to the asymmetric imposition of initial or final time boundary conditions, rather than from an inherent asymmetry in the dynamical law. This is the standard explanation of time asymmetric behaviour resulting from time symmetric laws.

abstract: Classical cybernetics is a successful meta-theory to model the regulation of complex systems from an abstract information-theoretic viewpoint, regardless of the properties of the system under scrutiny. Fundamental limits to the controllability of an open system can be formalized in terms of the law of requisite variety, which is derived from the second law of thermodynamics. These concepts are briefly reviewed, and the chances, challenges and potential gains arising from the generalisation of such a framework to the quantum domain are discussed.

abstract: Stochastic electrodynamics is a classical theory which assumes that the physical vacuum consists of classical stochastic fields with average energy $\frac{1}{2}\hbar \omega$ in each mode, i.e., the zero-point Planck spectrum. While this classical theory explains many quantum phenomena related to harmonic oscillator problems, hard results on nonlinear systems are still lacking. In this work the hydrogen ground state is studied by numerically solving the Abraham -- Lorentz equation in the dipole approximation. First the stochastic Gaussian field is represented by a sum over Gaussian frequency components, next the dynamics is solved numerically using OpenCL. The approach improves on work by Cole and Zou 2003 by treating the full $3d$ problem and reaching longer simulation times. The results are compared with a conjecture for the ground state phase space density. Though short time results suggest a trend towards confirmation, in all attempted modelings the atom ionises at longer times.

abstract: We reconstruct the time dependent quantum map corresponding to the relaxation process of a two-spin system in liquid-state NMR at room temperature. By means of quantum tomography techniques that handle informational incomplete data, we show how to properly post-process and normalise the measurements data for the simulation of quantum information processing, overcoming the unknown number of molecules prepared in a non-equilibrium magnetisation state ($N_j$) by an initial sequence of radiofrequency (RF) pulses. From the reconstructed quantum map, we infer both longitudinal ($T_1$) and transversal ($T_2$) relaxation times, and introduce the $J$-coupling relaxation times ($T^J_1,T^J_2$), which are relevant for quantum information processing simulations.

abstract: Some exact interactions between vibrational modes in systems with discrete symmetry can be described by the theory of the bushes of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) [G.M. Chechin, V.P. Sakhnenko. Physica D 117, 43 (1998)]. Each bush represents a dynamical object conserving the energy of the initial excitation. Existence of bushes of NNMs is ensured by some group-theoretical selection rules. In [G.M. Chechin, et al. Int. J. Non-Linear Mech. 38, 1451 (2003)], existence and stability of the bushes of vibrational modes in the simple octahedral model of mass points interacting via Lennard-Jones potential were investigated. In the present paper, we study these dynamical objects by the density functional theory in SF6 molecule which possesses the same symmetry and structure. We have fully confirmed the results previously obtained in the framework of the group theoretical approach and have found some new properties of the bushes of NNMs.

abstract: A theory of time-delayed coherent quantum feedback is developed. More specifically, we consider a quantum system coupled to a bosonic reservoir creating a unidirectional feedback loop. It is shown that the dynamics can be mapped onto a fictitious quantum cascade, where the system is driven by past versions of itself. The derivation of this model relies on a tensor network representation of the system-reservoir time-propagator. For concreteness, this general theory is applied to a driven two-level atom scattering into a coherent feedback loop. We demonstrate how delay effects can qualitatively change the dynamics of the atom, and how quantum control can be implemented in the presence of time-delays. A realization with a superconducting qubit serving as an artificial atom is discussed.

abstract: Given a gapped Hamiltonian of a spin chain, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the degenerate ground space projector. The output is an orthonormal set of matrix product states that approximate the true ground space projector up to an inverse polynomial error in any Schatten norm, with a runtime exponential in the degeneracy. Our algorithm is an extension of the recent algorithm of Landau, Vazirani, and Vidick for the nondegenerate case, and it includes the recent improvements due to Huang. The main new idea is to incorporate the local distinguishability of ground states on the half-chain to ensure that the algorithm returns a complete set of global ground states.

abstract: Elements of a novel theory of quantum physics are developed, synthesising the role of symbolism in describing quantum measurement and in the topological representation of fractal invariant sets in nonlinear dynamical systems theory. In this synthesis, the universe $U$ is treated as an isolated deterministic dynamical system evolving precisely on a measure-zero fractal invariant subset $I_U$ of its state space. A non-classical approach to the physics of $U$ is developed by treating the geometry of $I_U$ as more primitive than dynamical evolution equations on $I_U$. A specific symbolic representation of $I_U$ is constructed which encodes quaternionic multiplication and from which the statistical properties of complex Hilbert Space vectors are emergent. The Hilbert Space itself arises as the singular limit of Invariant Set Theory as a fractal parameter $N \rightarrow \infty$. Although the Hilbert Space of quantum theory is counterfactually complete, the measure-zero set $I_U$ is counterfactually incomplete, no matter how large is $N$. Such incompleteness allows reinterpretations of familiar quantum phenomena, consistent with realism and local causality. The non-computable nature of $I_U$ ensures that these reinterpretations are neither conspiratorial nor retrocausal and, through a homeomorphism with the ring of $2^N$-adic integers, are robust to noise and hence not fine tuned. The non-commutativity of Hilbert Space observables emerges from the symbolic representation of $I_U$ through the generic number-theoretic incommensurateness of $\phi/\pi$ and $\cos \phi$. Invariant Set Theory implies a much stronger synergy between cosmology and quantum physics than exists in contemporary theory, suggesting a novel approach to synthesising gravitational and quantum physics and providing new perspectives on the dark universe and information loss in black holes.

abstract: A locally causal hidden-variable theory of quantum physics need not be constrained by the Bell inequalities if this theory also partially violates the measurement independence condition. However, such violation can appear unphysical, implying implausible conspiratorial correlations between the hidden-variables of particles being measured and earlier determinants of instrumental settings. A novel physically plausible explanation for such correlations is proposed, based on the hypothesis that states of physical reality lie precisely on a non-computational measure-zero dynamically invariant set in the state space of the universe: the Cosmological Invariant Set Postulate. To illustrate the relevance of the concept of a global invariant set, a simple analogy is considered where a massive object is propelled into a black hole depending on the decay of a radioactive atom. It is claimed that a locally causal hidden-variable theory constrained by the Cosmological Invariant Set Postulate can violate the CHSH inequality without being conspiratorial, superdeterministic, fine-tuned or retrocausal, and the theory readily accommodates the classical compatibilist notion of (experimenter) free will.

We use an exact quantum theory of the KNR without any limitation on quantum noise and without any quantum state truncation procedure. We focus on understanding of various regimes of selective multi-photon resonant excitations of mode depending on the detuning, amplitude of the driving field and the strength of nonlinearity. The analysis is provided on the basis of the photon number distributions and photon-number correlation function.

abstract: For the purpose of a pedagogical introduction to the spatial aspects of Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC), we present here a detailed first-principles derivation of the transverse correlation width of photon pairs in degenerate collinear SPDC. Along the way, we discuss the quantum-optical calculation of the amplitude for the SPDC process, as well as its simplified form for nearly collinear degenerate phase matching. Following this, we show how this biphoton amplitude can be approximated with a Double-Gaussian wavefunction, give a brief discussion of the statistics of such Double-Gaussian distributions, and show how such approximations allow a simple description of the biphoton field over propagation. Next, we use this Double-Gaussian approximation to get a simplified estimation of the transverse correlation width, and compare it to more accurate calculations as well as experimental results. We then conclude with a discussion of the related concept of a biphoton birth zone, using it to develop intuition for the tradeoff between the first-order spatial coherence and bipohoton correlations in SPDC.

abstract: The quantum entanglement measure is determined, for the first time, for antiferromagnetic trimer spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains. The physical quantity proposed to measure the entanglement is the distance between states by adopting the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The method is applied to the new magnetic Cu(II) trimer system, 2b.3CuCl_2.2H_2O, and to the trinuclear Cu(II) halide salt, (3MAP)_2Cu_2Cl_8. The decoherence temperature, above which the entanglement is suppressed, is determined for the both systems. A correlation among their decoherence temperatures and their respective exchange coupling constants is established.

Applications to classical fields are examplied by effective simulation of both Bell and GHZ states, and a correlation analysis was performed to characterize the simulation. Results that strictly comply with criteria of quantum entanglement were obtained and the approach was also shown to be applicable to a system consisting of n quantum particles.

abstract: When quantum systems interact with the environment they lose their quantum properties, such as coherence. Quantum erasure makes it possible to restore coherence in a system by measuring its environment, but accessing the whole of it may be prohibitive: realistically one might have to concentrate only on an accessible subspace and neglect the rest. If that is the case, how good is quantum erasure? In this work we compute the largest coherence $\langle \mathcal C\rangle$ that we can expect to recover in a qubit, as a function of the dimension of the accessible and of the inaccessible subspaces of its environment. We then imagine the following game: we are given a uniformly random pure state of $n+1$ qubits and we are asked to compute the largest coherence that we can retrieve on one of them by optimally measuring a certain number $0\leq a\leq n$ of the others. We find a surprising effect around the value $a\approx n/2$: the recoverable coherence sharply transitions between 0 and 1, indicating that in order to restore full coherence on a qubit we need access to only half of its physical environment (or in terms of degrees of freedom to just the square root of them). Moreover, we find that the recoverable coherence becomes a typical property of the whole ensemble as $n$ grows.

abstract: Reminiscent of the bound character of a qubit's dynamics confined on the Bloch sphere, the observation of a Mollow triplet in the resonantly driven qubit fluorescence spectrum represents one of the founding signatures of Quantum Electrodynamics. Here we report on its observation in a hybrid spin-nanomechanical system, where a Nitro-gen Vacancy spin qubit is magnetically coupled to the vibrations of a Silicon Carbide nanowire. A resonant microwave field turns the originally parametric hybrid interac-tion into a resonant process, where acoustic phonons are now able to induce transitions between the dressed qubit states, leading to synchronized spin-oscillator dynamics. We further explore the vectorial character of the hybrid coupling to the bidimensional de-formations of the nanowire. The demonstrated microwave assisted synchronization of the spin-oscillator dynamics opens novel perspectives for the exploration of spin-dependent forces, the key-ingredient for quantum state transfer.

We illustrate the theory by explicitly studying a tunneling model with two energy levels and detuning.

Within this framework there are equivalent pictures of collapsing wave functions evolving in both time directions. The backwards-in-time Born rule can be broken by an initial condition on the Universe resulting in asymmetric behaviour. Similarly the forwards-in-time Born rule can in principle be broken by a final condition on the Universe.

abstract: The dynamics of a spinless charged particle under the influence of a magnetic field in curved space is considered. We chose the surface as being a cone defined by a line element in polar coordinates. The geometry of this line element establishes that the motion of the particle can occur on the surface of a cone or an anti-cone. As a consequence of the nontrivial topology of the cone and also because of two-dimensional confinement, the geometric potential should be taken into account. At first, we establish the conditions for the particle describing a circular path in such a context. Because of the presence of the geometric potential, which contains a singular term, we use the self-adjoint extension method in order to describe the dynamics in all space including the singularity. Expressions are obtained for the bound state energies and wave functions.

Graph states have a nice structure related to a certain graph, which is given by either a stabilizer group or an encoding circuit, both can be directly given by the graph. To generalize graph states, whose stabilizer groups are abelian subgroups of the Pauli group, one approach taken is to study non-abelian stabilizers. In this work, we propose to generalize graph states based on the encoding circuit, which is completely determined by the graph and a Hadamard matrix. We study the entanglement structures of these generalized graph states, and show that they are all maximally mixed locally. We also explore the relationship between the equivalence of Hadamard matrices and local equivalence of the corresponding generalized graph states. This leads to a natural generalization of the Pauli $(X,Z)$ pairs, which characterizes the local symmetries of these generalized graph states. Our approach is also naturally generalized to construct graph quantum codes which are beyond stabilizer codes.

abstract: Control strategies for dissipative preparation of target quantum states, both pure and mixed, and subspaces are obtained by switching between a set of available semigroup generators. We show that the class of problems of interest can be recast, from a control--theoretic perspective, into a switched-stabilization problem for linear dynamics. This is attained by a suitable affine transformation of the coherence-vector representation. In particular, we propose and compare stabilizing time-based and state-based switching rules for entangled state preparation, showing that the latter not only ensure faster convergence with respect to non-switching methods, but can designed so that they retain robustness with respect to initialization, as long as the target is a pure state or a subspace.

abstract: We discuss a general method for constructing nonreciprocal, cavity-based photonic devices, based on matching a given coherent interaction with its corresponding dissipative counterpart; our method generalizes the basic structure used in the theory of cascaded quantum systems. In contrast to standard interference-based schemes, our approach allows directional behavior over a wide bandwidth. We show how it can be used to devise isolators and directional, quantum-limited amplifiers. We discuss in detail how this general method allows the construction of a directional, noise-free phase-sensitive amplifier which is not limited by any fundamental gain-bandwidth constraint. Our approach is particularly well-suited to implementations using superconducting microwave circuits and optomechanical systems.

abstract: A relativistic/QED theory of light pressure on electrons by an isotropic, in particular blackbody radiation predicts thermalization rates of free electrons over entire span of energies available in the lab and the nature. The calculations based on the QED Klein-Nishina theory of electron-photon scattering and relativistic Fokker-Planck equation, show that the transition from classical (Thompson) to QED (Compton) thermalization determined by the product of electron energy and radiation temperature, is reachable under conditions for controlled nuclear fusion, and predicts large acceleration of electron thermalization in the Compton domain and strong damping of plasma oscillations at the temperatures near plasma nuclear fusion.

abstract: Here we present a protocol for generating Lissajous curves with a trapped ion by engineering Rashba- and the Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit interactions in a Paul trap. The unique anisotropic Rashba $\alpha_{x}$, $\alpha_{y}$ and Dresselhaus $\beta_{x}$, $\beta_{y}$ couplings afforded by our setup also enables us to obtain an "unusual" Zitterbewegung, i.e., the semiconductor analog of the relativistic trembling motion of electrons, with cycloidal trajectories in the absence of magnetic fields. We have also introduced bounded SO interactions, confined to an upper-bound vibrational subspace of the Fock states, as an additional mechanism to manipulate the Lissajous motion of the trapped ion. Finally, we accounted for dissipative effects on the vibrational degrees of freedom of the ion and find that the Lissajous trajectories are still robust and well defined for realistic parameters.

abstract: We consider typical realisation of a qubit as a single particle in two-path interferometric circuits built from phase shifters, beam splitters and detectors. It is often taken as a standard example in discussions of various paradoxes and quantum effects including non-locality. In this paper we show that it is possible to simulate behaviour of such circuits in a classical manner using stochastic gates and two kinds of particles, real ones and ghosts, which conform to the paradigm of locality. The model has built-in limited information gain and state disturbance in measurements which are blind to ghosts. We show that predictions of the model are operationally indistinguishable from the quantum case and allegedly 'non-local' effects arise only on the epistemic level of description by the agent whose knowledge is incomplete due to the restricted means of investigating the system.

abstract: Passive states are defined as those states that do not allow for work extraction in a cyclic (unitary) process. Within the set of passive states, thermal states are the most stable ones: they maximize the entropy for a given energy, and similarly they minimize the energy for a given entropy. In this article we find the passive states lying in the other extreme, i.e., those that maximize the energy for a given entropy, which we show also minimize the entropy when the energy is fixed. These extremal properties make these states useful to obtain fundamental bounds for the thermodynamics of finite dimensional quantum systems, which we show in several scenarios.

abstract: Effects of time-dependent applied fields on quantum coupled double-well (DW) systems with Razavy's hyperbolic potential have been studied. By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the DW system, we have obtained time-dependent occupation probabilities of the eigenstates, from which expectation values of positions $x_1$ and $x_2$ of particles ($<x_1+x_2 >$), the correlation ($\Gamma(t)$) and the concurrence ($C(t)$) expressing a degree of the entanglement of the coupled DW system, are obtained. Analytical expressions for $<x_1+x_2 >$, $\Gamma(t)$ and $C(t)$ are derived with the use of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) for sinusoidal fields. Model calculations have indicated that $<x_1+x_2 >$, $\Gamma(t)$ and $C(t)$ show very complicated time dependences. Results of the RWA are in good agreement with exact ones evaluated by numerical methods for cases of weak couplings and small applied fields in the near-resonant condition. Applications of our method to step fields are also studied.

abstract: Experimental tests of Bell-type inequalities distinguishing between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories remain of considerable interest if performed on massive particles, for which no conclusive result has yet been obtained. Only two-particle experiments may specifically test the concept of spatial nonlocality in quantum theory, whereas single-particle experiments may generally test the concept of quantum noncontextuality. Here we have performed the first Bell-type experiment with a beam of thermal-neutron pairs in the singlet state of spin, as originally suggested by J. S. Bell. These measurements confirm the quantum-theoretical predictions, in agreement with the results of the well-known polarization experiments carried out on optical photons years ago.

abstract: Entangled state of light is one of the essential quantum resources in quantum information science and technology. Especially, when the fundamental principle experiments have been achieved in labs and the applications of continuous variable quantum information in the real world are considered, it is crucial to design and construct the generation devices of entangled states with high entanglement and compact configuration. We have designed and built an efficient and compact light source of entangled state, which is a non-degenerate optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) with the triple resonance of the pump and two subharmonic modes. A wedged type-II KTP crystal inside the NOPA is used for implementing frequency-down-conversion of the pump field to generate the optical entangled state and achieving the dispersion compensation between the pump and the subharmonic waves. The EPR entangled state of light with quantum correlations of 8.4 dB for both amplitude and phase quadratures are experimentally produced by a single NOPA under the pump power of 75 mW.

abstract: We propose a Bell measurement scheme by employing a logical qubit in Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entanglement with an arbitrary number of photons. Remarkably, the success probability of the Bell measurement as well as teleportation of the GHZ entanglement can be made arbitrarily high using only linear optics elements and photon on-off measurements as the number of photons increases. Our scheme outperforms previous proposals using single photon qubits when comparing the success probabilities in terms of the average photon usages. It has another important advantage for experimental feasibility that it does not require photon number resolving measurements. Our proposal provides an alternative candidate for all-optical quantum information processing.

abstract: We demonstrate the possibility of optical nonreciprocal response in a three-mode optomechanical system where one mechanical mode is optomechanically coupled to two linearly coupled optical modes simultaneously. The optical nonreciprocal behavior is induced by the phase difference between the two optomechanical coupling rates which breaks the time-reversal symmetry of the three-mode optomechanical system. Moreover, the three-mode optomechanical system can also be used as a three-port circulator for two optical and one mechanical modes, which we refer to as optomechanical circulator.

abstract: The Boson Sampler is a quantum device that, for large enough number of photons, beats any classical computer in the calculation of scattering probabilities between many-photon states. The complexity of this problem lies in the implicit calculation of permanents (determinants without the alternating minus signs) of large matrices, which is known to belong to the class of hard problems in classical algorithmic theory. Here we show that a semiclassical theory of Boson Sampling can be constructed such that its classical limit is a canonical transformation, while quantum interference is encoded in the semiclassical form of the associated unitary operator. Based on this idea, we study the different coherent effects expected under different choices of the scattering states and provide different representations of the scattering probabilities.

abstract: We discuss the influence of atomic thermal motion on the efficiency of multimode quantum memory in two configurations: over the free expand of atoms cooled beforehand in a magneto-optical trap, and over complete mixing of atoms in a closed cell at room temperature. We consider the high-speed quantum memory, and assume that writing and retrieval are short enough, and the displacements of atoms during these stages are negligibly small. At the same time we take in account thermal motion during the storage time, which, as well known, must be much longer than durations of all the other memory processes for successful application of memory cell in communication and computation. We will analyze this influence in terms of eigenmodes of the full memory cycle and show that distortion of the eigenmodes, caused by thermal motion, leads to the efficiency reduction. We will demonstrate, that in the multimode memory this interconnection has complicated character.

Interference effects arising in resonance tunnelling in are studied in detail. The analysis allows us to gain further insight into the origin of interference effects in scattering of several identical particles.

abstract: Instabilities of equilibrium quantum mechanics are common and well-understood. They are manifested for example in phase transitions, where a quantum system becomes so sensitive to perturbations that a symmetry can be spontaneously broken. Here, we consider the possibility that the time evolution governing quantum dynamics may be similarly subject to an instability, at which its unitarity spontaneously breaks down owing to an extreme sensitivity towards perturbations. We find that indeed such an instability exists, and we explore its immediate consequences. Interpretations of the results both in terms of extreme sensitivity to the influence of environmental degrees of freedom, and in terms of a possible fundamental violation of unitarity are discussed.

abstract: The exact solutions of the complete Dirac equation for fermions moving in Aharonov-Bohm rings are used for deriving the exact expressions of the relativistic partial currents. It is show that as in the non-relativistic case these currents can be related to the derivative of the fermion energy with respect of the flux parameter. A specific relativistic effect is the saturation of the partial currents for high total angular momenta. Based on this property, the total relativistic persistent currents at $T=0$ are evaluated exactly, pointing out how these currents depend on the ring parameters.

abstract: We describe the generation of atom-resonant indistinguishable photon pairs using nonlinear optical techniques, their spectral purification using atomic filters, characterization using multi-photon interference, and application to quantum-enhanced sensing with atoms. Using either type-I or type-II cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion, we generate pairs of photons in the resonant modes of optical cavities with linewidths comparable to the 6 MHz natural linewidth of the D$_1$ line of atomic rubidium. The cavities and pump lasers are tuned so that emission occurs in a mode or a pair of orthogonally-polarized modes that are resonant to the D$_1$ line, at 794.7 nm. The emission from these frequency-degenerate modes is separated from other cavity emission using ultra-narrow atomic frequency filters, either a Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (FADOF) with a 445MHz linewidth and 57 dB of out-of-band rejection or an induced dichroism filter with an 80 MHz linewidth and $\ge$35dB out-of-band rejection. Using the type-I source, we demonstrate interference of photon pair amplitudes against a coherent state and a new method for full characterization of the temporal wave-function of narrow-band photon pairs. With the type-II source we demonstrate high-visibility super-resolving interference, a high-fidelity atom-tuned NooN state, and quantum enhanced sensing of atoms using indistinguishable photon pairs.

abstract: We propose using the optomechanical interaction to create artificial magnetic fields for photons on a lattice. The ingredients required are an optomechanical crystal, i.e. a piece of dielectric with the right pattern of holes, and two laser beams with the right pattern of phases. One of the two proposed schemes is based on optomechanical modulation of the links between optical modes, while the other is an lattice extension of optomechanical wavelength-conversion setups. We illustrate the resulting optical spectrum, photon transport in the presence of an artificial Lorentz force, edge states, and the photonic Aharonov-Bohm effect. Moreover, wWe also briefly describe the gauge fields acting on the synthetic dimension related to the phonon/photon degree of freedom. These can be generated using a single laser beam impinging on an optomechanical array.

We illustrate our methods by applying them to experimental data obtained from a transition-edge sensor (TES) detector.

Such Bogoliubov transformations frequently appear in the context of quantum optics. We provide a recipe for computing the quantum Fisher information for arbitrary pure initial states. We show that the maximally achievable precision of estimation is inversely proportional to the squared average particle number, and that such Heisenberg scaling requires non-classical, but not necessarily entangled states. Our method further allows to quantify losses in precision arising from being able to monitor only finitely many modes, for which we identify a lower bound.

abstract: We study the interplay between rotating wave approximation and optimal control. In particular, we show that for a wide class of optimal control problems one can choose the control field such that the Hamiltonian becomes time-independent under the rotating wave approximation. Thus, we show how to recast the functional minimization defined by the optimal control problem into a simpler multi-variable function minimization. We provide the analytic solution to the state-to-state transfer of the paradigmatic two-level system and to the more general star configuration of an $N$-level system. We demonstrate numerically the usefulness of this approach in the more general class of connected acyclic $N$-level systems with random spectra. Finally, we use it to design a protocol to entangle Rydberg via constant laser pulses atoms in an experimentally relevant range of parameters.

abstract: We analyze how pre-existing entanglement between two Unruh-DeWitt particle detectors evolves when one of the detectors falls through a Rindler firewall in (1+1)-dimensional Minkowski space. The firewall effect is minor and does not wash out the detector-detector entanglement, in some regimes even preserving the entanglement better than Minkowski vacuum. The absence of cataclysmic events should continue to hold for young black hole firewalls. A firewall's prospective ability to resolve the information paradox must hence hinge on its detailed gravitational structure, presently poorly understood.

abstract: The use of distributed amplifiers may have some potential advantages for the transmission of quantum information through optical fibers. In addition to the quantum noise introduced by the amplifiers, entanglement between atoms in the amplifying media and the optical field corresponds to which-path information that can further reduce the coherence. Here we analyze the effects of decoherence in a phase-insensitive distributed amplifier by using perturbation theory to calculate the state of the entire system including the atomic media. For an initial coherent state, tracing over the atomic states allows the reduced density matrix of the field to be expressed as a mixture of squeezed states with a reduced spread in photon number and an increased phase uncertainty. The amplifier noise and decoherence can be interpreted as being due to entanglement with the environment rather than the amplification of vacuum fluctuation noise. In addition to providing increased insight into the effects of decoherence, these results can be applied to nonclassical superposition states such as Schrodinger cats.

abstract: We study the scaling of decoherence of decoupled electron spin qubits due to hyperfine interaction. For a superposed state consisting of product states from a single Zeeman manifold, both $T_2^*(n)$ and $T_2(n)$ are scale-free with respect to $n$ and the number of basis states, $m$. For a superposed state made up of states from different Zeeman manifolds, both $T_2(n)$ and $T_2^*(n)$ are roughly inversely proportional to $\sqrt{n}$. Our results can be extended to other decoherence mechanisms, including in the presence of dynamical decoupling, which allow meaningful discussions on the scalability of spin-based coherent solid state quantum technology.

abstract: Pigment protein complexes involved in photosynthesis are remarkably efficient in transferring excitation energy from light harvesting antenna molecules to a reaction centre, where it is converted to and stored as chemical energy. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that quantum coherence and correlations may play a role in this excitation energy transfer (EET). We examine whether bipartite quantum nonlocality, a property that verifies a strong correlation between two quantum systems, exists between different pairs of chromophores in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex and how this is related to the amount of bipartite entanglement. In particular, it is tested in what way these correlation properties are affected by different initial conditions. When modeling the EET in the FMO complex with the hierarchially coupled equations of motions, it is found that bipartite nonlocality indeed exists for some pairs of chromophores. It seems like the choice of initial condition strongly affects whether nonlocality is found or not. It is also seen that nonlocality and entanglement are two different properties in this system. In particular, nonlocality only exists on a very short timescale and then drops to zero in a very abrupt manner; a feature we choose to call nonlocality sudden death. Quantum entanglement between chromophore pairs, on the other hand, is oscillating and exponentially decaying and follow thereby a pattern more similar to the chromophore population dynamics.

abstract: Some open questions exist with fluctuation-induced forces between extended dipoles. Conventional intuition derives from large-separation perturbative approximations to dispersion force theory. Here we present a full non-perturbative theory. In addition we discuss how one can take into account finite dipole size corrections. It is of fundamental value to investigate the limits of validity of the perturbative dispersion force theory.

abstract: The complex internal atomic structure involved in radiative transitions has an effect on the spectrum of fluctuations (noise) of the transmitted light. A degenerate transition has different properties in this respect than a pure two-level transition. We investigate these variations by studying a certain transition between two degenerate atomic levels for different choices of the polarization state of the driving laser. For circular polarization, corresponding to the textbook two-level atom case, the optical spectrum shows the characteristic Mollow triplet for strong laser drive, while the corresponding noise spectrum exhibits squeezing in some frequency ranges. For a linearly polarized drive, corresponding to the case of a multilevel system, additional features appear in both optical and noise spectra. These differences are more pronounced in the regime of a weakly driven transition: whereas the two-level case essentially exhibits elastic scattering, the multilevel case has extra noise terms related to spontaneous Raman transitions. We also discuss the possibility to experimentally observe these predicted differences for the commonly encountered case where the laser drive has excess noise in its phase quadrature.

abstract: We study the effect of quantum statistics on the arrival time distribution of quantum particles computed through the probability current density. It is shown that symmetrization or asymmetrization of the wave function affects the arrival time distribution for even freely propagating particles. In order to investigate the effect of statistics on the weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics (WEQ), we then compute the mean arrival time for wave packets in free fall. The violation of WEQ through the effect of statistics on the mass-dependence of the mean arrival time is clearly exhibited. We finally evaluate the effect of spin on the violation of WEQ using a different approach by including an explicit spin-dependence in the probability current distribution, and compare it with the approach using particle statistics. Our results show WEQ re-emerges smoothly in the limit of large mass.

abstract: A theorem for the invertibility of arbitrary response functions is presented under the following conditions: the time-dependence of the potentials should be Laplace transformable and the initial state should be a ground state, though might be degenerate. This theorem provides a rigorous foundation for all density-functional-like theories in the time-dependent linear response regime. Especially for time-dependent one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM) functional theory this is an important step forward, since a solid foundation has currently been lacking. The theorem is equally valid for static response functions in the non-degenerate case, so can be used to characterize the uniqueness of potential in the ground state version of the corresponding density-functional-like theory. Such a classification of the uniqueness of the non-local potential in ground state 1RDM functional has been lacking for decades. With the aid of presented invertibility theorem, a complete classification of the non-uniqueness of the non-local potential for the non-degenerate case can be given for the first time.

abstract: We report the first observation of Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference of highly indistinguishable photon pairs with spatial resolution. Direct imaging of two-photon coalescence with an intensified sCMOS camera system clearly reveals spatially separated photons appearing pairwise within one of the two modes. With the use of the camera system we quantified the number of pairs and recovered the full HOM dip yielding 96.3% interference visibility, as well as retrieved the number of coalesced pairs. We retrieved the spatial mode structure of both interfering photons by performing a proof-of-principle demonstration of a new, low noise high resolution coincidence imaging scheme.

abstract: We study uncertainty and certainty relations for two successive measurements of two-dimensional observables. Uncertainties in successive measurement are considered within the following two scenarios. In the first scenario, the second measurement is performed on the quantum state generated after the first measurement with completely erased information. In the second scenario, the second measurement is performed on the post-first-measurement state conditioned on the actual measurement outcome. Induced quantum uncertainties are characterized by means of the Tsallis entropies. For two successive projective measurement of a qubit, we obtain minimal and maximal values of related entropic measures of induced uncertainties. Some conclusions found in the second scenario are extended to arbitrary finite dimensionality. In particular, a connection with mutual unbiasedness is emphasized.

abstract: It is possible to sense the internal dynamics of individual clusters of nuclear spins by observing the coherence decay of a nearby electronic spin: the weak magnetic noise is amplified by a dynamical decoupling sequence of microwave pulses, though it remains challenging to relate experimental traces to underlying atomic-scale structure. For periodic dynamical decoupling control, we show that the Floquet eigenphases and eigenstates of the system provide the most natural framework for data analysis and fingerprinting of complex spin environments, offering more accuracy than the frequencies of either the static problem or of average Hamiltonian models. This approach is fully general for any temporally periodic protocol and sensor, but is here tested on NV centres and systems for which the quantization axis varies as a function of applied magnetic field; for instance, electron donors in silicon, such as arsenic and bismuth, exhibit regimes of high sensitivity of decoherence with respect to magnetic fields, so represent promising potential sensors.

abstract: We apply the time-dependent decoherence-free subspace theory to a Markovian open quantum system in order to present a novel proposal for quantum-state engineering program. By quantifying the purity of the quantum state, we verify that the quantum-state engineering process designed via our method is completely unitary within any total engineering time. Even though the controls on the open quantum system are not perfect, the asymptotic purity is still robust. Owing to its ability to completely resist decoherence and the lack of restraint in terms of the total engineering time, our proposal is suitable for multitask quantum-state engineering program. Therefore, this proposal is not only useful for achieving the quantum-state engineering program experimentally, it also helps us build both a quantum simulation and quantum information equipment in reality.

abstract: Fawzi and Renner (arXiv:1410.0664) recently established a lower bound on the conditional quantum mutual information of tripartite quantum states $\rho_{ABC}$ in terms of the fidelity of recovery, i.e. the maximal fidelity of the state $\rho_{ABC}$ with a state reconstructed from its marginal $\rho_{BC}$ by acting only on the $C$ system. In this brief note we show that the fidelity of recovery is multiplicative by utilizing semi-definite programming duality. This allows us to simplify an operational proof by Brandao et al. (arXiv:1411.4921) of the above-mentioned lower bound that is based on quantum state redistribution. In particular, in contrast to the previous approaches, our proof does not rely on de Finetti reductions.

abstract: Quantum information measures such as the entropy and the mutual information find applications in physics, e.g., as correlation measures. Generalizing such measures based on the R\'enyi entropies is expected to enhance their scope in applications. We prescribe R\'enyi generalizations for any quantum information measure which consists of a linear combination of von Neumann entropies with coefficients chosen from the set {-1,0,1}. As examples, we describe R\'enyi generalizations of the conditional quantum mutual information, some quantum multipartite information measures, and the topological entanglement entropy. Among these, we discuss the various properties of the R\'enyi conditional quantum mutual information and sketch some potential applications. We conjecture that the proposed R\'enyi conditional quantum mutual informations are monotone increasing in the R\'enyi parameter, and we have proofs of this conjecture for some special cases.

abstract: We put forward an experimental scheme for direct generation of optical squeezed coherent-state superpositions. The proposed setup makes use of an optical cavity, filled with a nonlinear Kerr medium, whose frequency is allowed to change during time evolution. By exactly solving the corresponding time-dependent anharmonic-oscillator Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that squeezed-state superpositions can be generated in an optical cavity. Furthermore, we show that the squeezing degree of the produced states can be tuned by properly controlling the frequency shift of the cavity, a feature that could be useful in many quantum information protocols, such as quantum teleportation and quantum computing.

abstract: We investigate quantum control of an oscillator mode off-resonantly coupled to an ancillary qubit. In the strong dispersive regime, we may drive the qubit conditioned on number states of the oscillator, which together with displacement operations can achieve universal control of the oscillator. Based on our proof of universal control, we provide explicit constructions for arbitrary state preparation and arbitrary unitary operation of the oscillator. Moreover, we present an efficient procedure to prepare the number state $\left|n\right\rangle$ using only $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$ operations. We also compare our scheme with known quantum control protocols for coupled qubit-oscillator systems. This universal control scheme of the oscillator can readily be implemented using superconducting circuits.

This method is shown to be advantageous compared to existing laser-cooling methods in terms of its cooling efficiency, the lowest attainable temperature for broadband baths and its versatility: it can cool down any heat reservoir, provided the laser is red-detuned from the atomic resonance. It is applicable to cooling down both dense gaseous and condensed media.

The exact correspondence, given by this relation, provides a simple protocol to quantify the flows of Shannon and Renyi entropies from the measurements of energy transfer statistics.

Fractional minimum positive semidefinite rank is defined from $r$-fold faithful orthogonal representations and it is shown that the projective rank of any graph equals the fractional minimum positive semidefinite rank of its complement. An $r$-fold version of the traditional definition of minimum positive semidefinite rank of a graph using Hermitian matrices that fit the graph is also presented. Connections of these concepts to quantum theory, including Tsirelson's problem, are discussed.

abstract: We demonstrate a dynamic macroscopic quantum oscillator of cavity-induced correlated electron-hole pairs in high-density plasmas created in an optically induced confining potential in a semiconductor microcavity at room temperature. One major advancement is the visualization of quantum oscillator states in a micrometer-scale optical potential at quantized energies up to 4 meV, an order of magnitude higher than that previously observed in spatially confined polariton condensates at cryogenic temperatures. Another advancement is the ability to characterize the time evolution of the quantum oscillator states directly from the consequent pulse radiation. We identify sequential multiple $\sim$10 ps pulse lasing in such an optically induced harmonic potential.

abstract: We propose a scheme to mimic and directly measure the fractional particle number in a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with ultracold fermions in one-dimensional optical lattices. We show that the fractional particle number in this model can be simulated in the momentum-time parameter space in terms of Berry curvature without a spatial domain wall. In this simulation, a hopping modulation is adiabatically tuned to form a kink-type configuration and the induced current plays the role of an analogous soliton distributing in the time domain, such that the mimicked fractional particle number is expressed by the particle transport. Two feasible experimental setups of optical lattices for realizing the required Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian with tunable parameters and time-varying hopping modulation are presented. We also show practical methods for measuring the particle transport in the proposed cold atom systems by numerically calculating the shift of the Wannier center and the center of mass of an atomic cloud.

With this system, we also demonstrate the production of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensates (mBEC), and observe the anisotropic expansion of Fermi gases in the so-called BEC-BCS crossover regime.

abstract: In the high-energy quantum-physics literature one finds statements such as "matrix algebras converge to the sphere". Earlier I provided a general setting for understanding such statements, in which the matrix algebras are viewed as quantum metric spaces, and convergence is with respect to a quantum Gromov-Hausdorff-type distance. In the present paper, as preparation of discussing similar statements for convergence of "vector bundles" over matrix algebras to vector bundles over spaces, we introduce and study suitable matrix-norms for matrix algebras and spaces. Very recently Latremoliere introduced an improved quantum Gromov-Hausdorff-type distance between quantum metric spaces. We use it throughout this paper. To facilitate the calculations we introduce and develop a general notion of "bridges with conditional expectations".

abstract: We investigate the quantum phases of hard-core bosonic atoms in an extended Hubbard model where particles interact via soft-shoulder potentials in one dimension. Using a combination of field-theoretical methods and strong-coupling perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the low-energy phase can be a conformal cluster Luttinger liquid (CLL) phase with central charge $c=1$, where the microscopic degrees of freedom correspond to mesoscopic ensembles of particles. Using numerical density-matrix-renormalization-group methods, we demonstrate that the CLL phase, first predicted in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 165302 (2013)], is separated from a conventional Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by an exotic critical point with central charge $c=3/2$. The latter is expression of an emergent conformal supersymmetry, which is not present in the original Hamiltonian. We discuss the observability of the CLL phase in realistic experimental settings with weakly-dressed Rydberg atoms confined to optical lattices. Using quantum Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that the typical features of CLLs are stable up to comparatively high temperatures. Using exact diagonalizations and quantum trajectory methods, we provide a protocol for adiabatic state preparation as well as quantitative estimates on the effects of particle losses.

abstract: We analyse a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) mixed with a superfluid two-component Fermi gas in the whole BCS-BEC cross-over. Using a quasiparticle random phase approximation combined with Beliaev theory to describe the Fermi superfluid and the BEC respectively, we show that the single particle and collective excitations of the Fermi gas give rise to an induced interaction between the bosons, which varies strongly with momentum and frequency. It diverges at the sound mode of the Fermi superfluid, resulting in a sharp avoided crossing feature and a corresponding sign change of the interaction energy shift in the excitation spectrum of the BEC. In addition, the excitation of quasiparticles in the Fermi superfluid leads to damping of the excitations in the BEC. Besides studying induced interactions themselves, these prominent effects can be used to systematically probe the strongly interacting Fermi gas.

abstract: Within the Dirac model for the electronic excitations of graphene, we calculate the full polarization tensor with finite mass and chemical potential. It has, besides the (00)-component, a second form factor, which must be accounted for. We obtain explicit formulas for both form factors and for the reflection coefficients. Using these, we discuss the regions in the momentum-frequency plane where plasmons may exist and give numeric solutions for the plasmon dispersion relations. It turns out that plasmons exist for both, TE and TM polarizations over the whole range of the ratio of mass to chemical potential, except for zero chemical potential, where only a TE plasmon exists.

We discuss the free particle hypotheses and those relevant to particles subject to non-trivial potentials. In the latter case we will show how the proposed method leads to easily implementable numerical algorithms.

abstract: The presence of a weak second-harmonic field in an intense-laser ionization experiment affects the momentum-resolved electron yield, depending on the relative phase between the $\omega$ and the $2\omega$ component. The proposed two-color 'phase-of-the-phase spectroscopy' quantifies for each final electron momentum a relative-phase contrast (RPC) and a 'phase of the phase' (PP), describing how much and with which phase lag, respectively, the yield changes as function of relative phase. Experimental results for RPC and PP spectra for rare gas atoms and CO$_2$ are presented. The spectra demonstrate a rather universal structure that is analyzed with the help of a simple model based on electron trajectories, wave-packet spreading, and (multiple) rescattering. Details in the PP and RPC spectra are target sensitive and thus may be used to extract structural (or even dynamical) information with high accuracy.

abstract: We review the spin radical pair mechanism which is a promising explanation of avian navigation. This mechanism is based on the dependence of product yields on (1) the hyperfine interaction involving electron spins and neighboring nuclear spins and (2) the intensity and orientation of the geomagnetic field. One surprising result is that even at ambient conditions quantum entanglement of electron spins can play an important role in avian magnetoreception. This review describes the general scheme of chemical reactions involving radical pairs generated from singlet and triplet precursors; the spin dynamics of the radical pairs; and the magnetic field dependence of product yields caused by the radical pair mechanism. The main part of the review includes a description of the chemical compass in birds. We review: the general properties of the avian compass; the basic scheme of the radical pair mechanism; the reaction kinetics in cryptochrome; quantum coherence and entanglement in the avian compass; and the effects of noise. We believe that the "quantum avian compass" can play an important role in avian navigation and can also provide the foundation for a new generation of sensitive and selective magnetic-sensing nano-devices.

abstract: Landau-Zener transition (LZT) has been explored in a variety of physical systems for coherent population transfer between different quantum states. In recent years, there have been various proposals for applying LZT to quantum information processing because when compared to the methods using ac pulse for coherent population transfer, protocols based on LZT are less sensitive to timing errors. However, the effect of finite range of qubit energy available to LZT based state control operations has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we show that using the well-known Landau-Zener formula in the vicinity of an avoided energy-level crossing will cause considerable errors due to coherent oscillation of the transition probability in a single-passage LZT experiment. The data agree well with the numerical simulations which take the transient dynamics of LZT into account. These results not only provide a closer view on the issue of finite-time LZT but also shed light on its effects on the quantum state manipulation.

abstract: In this paper, we generalize a previous relativistic $1+1$-dimensional model for two mass-less Dirac particles with relativistic contact interactions to the $N$-particle case. Our model is based on the notion of a multi-time wave function which, according to Dirac, is the central object in a relativistic multi-particle quantum theory in the Schr\"odinger picture. Consequently, we achieve a manifestly Lorentz invariant formulation on configuration space-time. Our model is constructed to be compatible with antisymmetry and probability conservation in a relativistic sense. On the mathematical side, we further develop the method of multi-time characteristics and show that uniqueness of solutions follows from probability conservation. We prove that the model is interacting and outline how one can understand the interaction as effectively given by a $\delta$-potential at equal times. Finally, we answer the question whether Lorentz invariant and probability-conserving dynamics can also be obtained when the particles are confined in a region with a non-zero minimal space-like distance, a question relevant for an extension to higher dimensions.

abstract: Validity of just a few physical conditions comprising the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) suffices to ensure that gravity can be understood as space-time geometry. EEP is therefore subject to an ongoing experimental verification, with present day tests reaching the regime where quantum mechanics becomes relevant. Here we show that the classical formulation of the EEP does not apply in such a regime. The EEP requires equivalence between the total rest mass-energy of a system, the mass-energy that constitutes its inertia, and the mass-energy that constitutes its weight. In quantum mechanics internal energy is given by a Hamiltonian operator describing dynamics of internal degrees of freedom. We therefore introduce a quantum formulation of the EEP -- equivalence between the rest, inertial and gravitational internal energy operators. We show that the validity of the classical EEP does not imply the validity of its quantum formulation, which thus requires an independent experimental verification. We reanalyse some already completed experiments with respect to the quantum EEP and discuss to which extent they allow testing its various aspects.

abstract: We study the physics of interacting spin-$1$ bosons in an optical lattice using a variational Gutzwiller technique. We compute the mean-field ground state wave-function and discuss the evolution of the condensate, spin, nematic, and singlet order parameters across the superfluid-Mott transition. We then extend the Gutzwiller method to derive the equations governing the dynamics of low energy excitations in the lattice. Linearizing these equations, we compute the excitation spectra in the superfluid and Mott phases for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin-spin interactions. In the superfluid phase, we recover the known excitation spectrum obtained from Bogoliubov theory. In the nematic Mott phase, we obtain gapped, quadratically dispersing particle and hole-like collective modes, whereas in the singlet Mott phase, we obtain a non-dispersive gapped mode, corresponding to the breaking of a singlet pair. For the ferromagnetic Mott insulator, the Gutzwiller mean-field theory only yields particle-hole like modes but no Goldstone mode associated with long range spin order. To overcome this limitation, we supplement the Gutzwiller theory with a Schwinger boson mean-field theory which captures super-exchange driven fluctuations. In addition to the gapped particle-hole-like modes, we obtain a gapless quadratically dispersing ferromagnetic spin-wave Goldstone mode. We discuss the evolution of the singlet gap, particle-hole gap, and the effective mass of the ferromagnetic Goldstone mode as the superfluid-Mott phase boundary is approached from the insulating side. We discuss the relevance and validity of Gutzwiller mean-field theories to spinful systems, and potential extensions of this framework to include more exotic physics which appears in the presence of spin-orbit coupling or artificial gauge fields.

abstract: We have applied the recently developed theory of topological Uhlmann numbers to an emblematic model of topological insulator in 2D such as the Qi-Wu-Zhang model. We have found a stable symmetry-protected topological phase under external thermal fluctuations in two-dimensions. A complete phase diagram for this model is computed as a function of temperature and coupling constants in the original Hamiltonian. It shows the appearance of large stable phases of matter with topological properties compatible with thermal fluctuations or external noise and the existence of critical lines separating abruptly trivial phases from topological phases. These novel critical temperatures represent thermal topological phase transitions. The initial part of the paper comprises a self-contained explanation of the Uhlmann geometric phase needed to understand the topological properties that it may acquire when applied to topological insulators and superconductors.

abstract: We consider Gaussian states of fermionic systems and study the action of the partial transposition on the density matrix. It is shown that, with a suitable choice of basis, these states are transformed into a linear combination of two Gaussian operators that are uniquely defined in terms of the covariance matrix of the original state. In case of a reflection symmetric geometry, this result can be used to efficiently calculate a lower bound for a well-known entanglement measure, the logarithmic negativity. Furthermore, exact expressions can be derived for traces involving integer powers of the partial transpose. The method can also be applied to the quantum Ising chain and the results show perfect agreement with the predictions of conformal field theory.

Furthermore, we study the impact of a tensor noise onto the coherence properties of massive systems. We discuss that a particular choice of tensor noise shows similarities to a mechanism proposed by Diosi and Penrose.

abstract: Bloch theorem states the impossibility of persistent electric currents in the ground state of nonrelativistic fermion systems. We extend this theorem to generic systems based on the gauged particle number symmetry and study its consequences on the example of chiral transport phenomena. We show that the chiral magnetic effect can be understood as a generalization of the Bloch theorem to a nonequilibrium steady state, similarly to the integer quantum Hall effect. On the other hand, persistent axial currents are not prohibited by the Bloch theorem and they can be regarded as Pauli paramagnetism of relativistic matter. An application of the generalized Bloch theorem to quantum time crystals is also discussed.

abstract: Photons are nonchiral particles: their handedness can be both left and right. However, when light is transversely confined, it can locally exhibit a transverse spin whose orientation is fixed by the propagation direction of the photons. Confined photons thus have chiral character. Here, we employ this to demonstrate nonreciprocal transmission of light at the single-photon level through a silica nanofibre in two experimental schemes. We either use an ensemble of spin-polarised atoms that is weakly coupled to the nanofibre-guided mode or a single spin-polarised atom strongly coupled to the nanofibre via a whispering-gallery-mode resonator. We simultaneously achieve high optical isolation and high forward transmission. Both are controlled by the internal atomic state. The resulting optical diode is the first example of a new class of nonreciprocal nanophotonic devices which exploit the chirality of confined photons and which are, in principle, suitable for quantum information processing and future quantum optical networks.

We follow England's use of time-reversal symmetry but replace stochastic by deterministic dynamics, and introduce a definition of metastable states based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. We rederive England's detailed balance relation and obtain another similar relation which appears more natural and remains valid for quantum systems. The detailed balance relations are based on serious physical ideas, and either of them can be used for England's biological discussion. This biological discussion does of course deserve further scrutiny.

One channel is used to form quantum dots and the other is used for charge sensing. The quantum dot transport channel can support either a single or a double quantum dot. We demonstrate few-electron occupation in a single quantum dot and extract charging energies as large as 6.6 meV. Magnetospectroscopy is used to measure valley splittings in the range of 35-70 microeV. By energizing two additional gates we form a few-electron double quantum dot and demonstrate tunable tunnel coupling at the (1,0) to (0,1) interdot charge transition.

abstract: The possibility to make 10 nm scale, and low-disorder, suspended graphene devices would open up many possibilities to study and make use of strongly coupled quantum electronics, quantum mechanics, and optics. We present a versatile method, based on the electromigration of gold-on-graphene bow-tie bridges, to fabricate low-disorder suspended graphene junctions and quantum dots with lengths ranging from 6 nm up to 55 nm. We control the length of the junctions, and shape of their gold contacts by adjusting the power at which the electromigration process is allowed to avalanche. Using carefully engineered gold contacts and a nonuniform downward electrostatic force, we can controllably tear the width of suspended graphene channels from over 100 nm down to 27 nm. We demonstrate that this lateral confinement creates high-quality suspended quantum dots. This fabrication method could be extended to other two-dimensional materials.

abstract: Under the second-order degenerate perturbation theory, we show that the physics of $N$ particles with arbitrary spin confined in a one dimensional trap in the strongly interacting regime can be described by super-exchange interaction. An effective spin-chain Hamiltonian (non-translational-invariant Sutherland model) can be constructed from this procedure. For spin-1/2 particles, this model reduces to the non-translational-invariant Heisenberg model, where a transition between Heisenberg anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) states is expected to occur when the interaction strength is tuned from the strongly repulsive to the strongly attractive limit. We show that the FM and the AFM states can be distinguished in two different methods: the first is based on their distinct response to a spin-dependent magnetic gradient, and the second is based on their distinct momentum distribution. We confirm the validity of the spin-chain model by comparison with results obtained from several unbiased techniques

abstract: Is quantum coherence responsible for the surprisingly high efficiency of natural light harvesters? If so, how do such systems avoid the loss of coherence due to interaction with their warm, wet and noisy environments? The answer to these important questions rests in the beneficial interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here we report experimental and theoretical verification of coherent exciton-vibrational (vibronic) coupling as the origin of long-lasting coherence in an artificial light harvester, a molecular J-aggregate. In this macroscopically aligned tubular system, polarization controlled 2D spectroscopy delivers an uncongested and specific optical response. This clarity of signal provided the opportunity to unambiguously assign the origin of the observed long-lived coherences to vibronic coupling and rule out other explanations based upon correlated fluctuations. The discussed vibronic coupling is functionally relevant, as it describes interaction between vibrations and electronic excited states and hence possesses the potential for enhancing energy transfer.

abstract: In the face of mounting numerical evidence, Metlitski and Grover [arXiv:1112.5166] have given compelling analytical arguments that systems with spontaneous broken continuous symmetry contain a sub-leading contribution to the entanglement entropy that diverges logarithmically with system size. They predict that the coefficient of this log is a universal quantity that depends on the number of Goldstone modes. In this paper, we confirm the presence of this log term through quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the second R\'enyi entropy on the spin 1/2 XY model. Devising an algorithm to facilitate convergence of entropy data at extremely low temperatures, we demonstrate that the single Goldstone mode in the ground state can be identified through the coefficient of the log term. Furthermore, our simulation accuracy allows us to obtain an additional geometric constant additive to the R\'enyi entropy, that matches a predicted fully-universal form obtained from a free bosonic field theory with no adjustable parameters.

abstract: Optomechanical devices sensitively transduce and actuate motion of nanomechanical structures using light. Single--crystal diamond promises to improve the performance of optomechanical devices, while also providing opportunities to interface nanomechanics with diamond color center spins and related quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate dissipative waveguide--optomechanical coupling exceeding 35 GHz/nm to diamond nanobeams supporting both optical waveguide modes and mechanical resonances, and use this optomechanical coupling to measure nanobeam displacement with a sensitivity of $9.5$ fm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and optical bandwidth $>150$nm. The nanobeams are fabricated from bulk optical grade single--crystal diamond using a scalable undercut etching process, and support mechanical resonances with quality factor $2.5 \times 10^5$ at room temperature, and $7.2 \times 10^5$ in cryogenic conditions (5K). Mechanical self--oscillations, resulting from interplay between photothermal and optomechanical effects, are observed with amplitude exceeding 200 nm for sub-$\mu$W absorbed optical power, demonstrating the potential for optomechanical excitation and manipulation of diamond nanomechanical structures.

abstract: The entanglement entropy of a noninteracting fermionic system confined to a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice on a torus is calculated. We find that the entanglement entropy can characterize Lifshitz phase transitions without a local order parameter. In the noncritical phase and critical phase with a nodal Fermi surface, the entanglement entropy satisfies an area law. The leading subarea term is a constant in the gapped phase rather than a logarithmic additive term in the gapless regime. The tuning of chemical potential allows for a nonzero Fermi surface, whose variation along a particular direction determines a logarithmic violation of the area law. We perform the scaling of entanglement entropy numerically and find agreement between the analytic and numerical results. Furthermore, we clearly show that an entanglement spectrum is equivalent to an edge spectrum.

Quantum computation, in particular Grover's algorithm, has aroused a great deal of interest since it allows for a quadratic speedup to be obtained in search procedures. In this work we consider the impact of incorporating classical search concepts alongside Grover's algorithm into a hybrid quantum search system. Some of the crucial points examined include: (1) the reverberations of contemplating the use of non-constant branching factors; (2) determining the consequences of incorporating an heuristic perspective into a quantum tree search model.

abstract: Quantum computation, in particular Grover's algorithm, has aroused a great deal of interest since it allows for a quadratic speedup to be obtained in search procedures. Classical search procedures for an $N$ element database require at most $O(N)$ time complexity. Grover's algorithm is able to find a solution with high probability in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time through an amplitude amplification scheme. In this work we draw elements from both classical and quantum computation to develop an alternative search proposal based on quantum entanglement detection schemes. In 2002, Horodecki and Ekert proposed an efficient method for direct detection of quantum entanglement. Our proposition to quantum search combines quantum entanglement detection alongside entanglement inducing operators. Grover's quantum search relies on measuring a quantum superposition after having applied a unitary evolution. We deviate from the standard method by focusing on fine-tuning a unitary operator in order to infer the solution with certainty. Our proposal sacrifices space for speed and depends on the mathematical properties of linear positive maps $\Lambda$ which have not been operationally characterized. Whether such a $\Lambda$ can be easily determined remains an open question.

abstract: We study the continuity of an abstract generalization of the maximum-entropy inference - a maximizer. It is defined as a right-inverse of a linear map restricted to a convex body which uniquely maximizes on each fiber of the linear map a continuous function on the convex body. Using convex geometry we prove, amongst others, the existence of discontinuities of the maximizer at limits of extremal points not being extremal points themselves and apply the result to quantum correlations. Further, we use numerical range methods in the case of quantum inference which refers to two observables. One result is a complete characterization of points of discontinuity for $3\times 3$ matrices.

abstract: The production system is a theoretical model of computation relevant to the artificial intelligence field allowing for problem solving procedures such as hierarchical tree search. In this work we explore some of the connections between artificial intelligence and quantum computation by presenting a model for a quantum production system. Our approach focuses on initially developing a model for a reversible production system which is a simple mapping of Bennett's reversible Turing machine. We then expand on this result in order to accommodate for the requirements of quantum computation. We present the details of how our proposition can be used alongside Grover's algorithm in order to yield a speedup comparatively to its classical counterpart. We discuss the requirements associated with such a speedup and how it compares against a similar quantum hierarchical search approach.

abstract: In this work we show that the molecular chemical bond formation and dissociation in presence of the d-band of a metal catalyst can be described as a Quantum Dynamical Phase Transition (QDPT). This agree with DFT calculations that predict sudden jumps in some observables as the molecule breaks. According to our model this phenomenon emerges because the catalyst provides for a non- Hermitian Hamiltonian. We show that when the molecule approaches the surface, as occurs in the Heyrovsky reaction of H 2, the bonding H 2 orbital has a smooth crossover into a bonding molecular orbital built with the closest H orbital and the surface metal d-states. The same occurs for the antibonding state. Meanwhile, two resonances appear within the continuous spectrum of the d- band which are associated with bonding and antibonding orbitals between the furthest H atom and the d-states at the second metallic layer. These move towards the band center where they collapse into a pure metallic resonance and an almost isolated H orbital. This phenomenon constitutes a striking example of the non-trivial physics enabled when one deals with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian beyond the usual wide band approximation.

The usual path is to quantize the gravitational field in order to introduce the statistical structure characteristic of quantum mechanics. The procedure followed here instead is to remove the statistical element of quantum theory by introducing final boundary conditions as well as initial. The relevant quantum formalism then becomes compatible with the non-statistical nature of general relativity.

abstract: Quantum entanglement under an extensive bipartition can reveal the critical boundary theory of a topological phase in the parameter space. In this study we demonstrate that the infinite-randomness fixed point for spin-1/2 degrees of freedom can emerge from an extensive random bipartition of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki chain. The nested entanglement entropy of the ground state of the reduced density matrix exhibits a logarithmic scaling with an effective central charge $\tilde{c} = 0.72 \pm 0.02 \approx \ln 2$. We further discuss, in the language of bulk quantum entanglement, how to understand all phase boundaries and the surrounding Griffiths phases for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1 chain with quenched disorder and dimerization.

abstract: Both the physical picture of the dynamics of atoms and molecules in intense infrared fields and its theoretical description use the concept of electron trajectories. Here we address a key question which arises in this context: Are distinctly quantum features of these trajectories, such as the complex-valued coordinates, physically relevant in the classically allowed region of phase space, and what is their origin? First, we argue that solutions of classical equations of motion can account for quantum effects. To this end, we construct an exact solution to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation which accounts for dynamics of the wave packet, and show that this solution is physically correct in the limit $\hbar \to 0$. Second, we show that imaginary components of classical trajectories are directly linked to the finite size of the initial wavepacket in momentum space. This way, if the electronic wavepacket produced by optical tunneling in strong infrared fiels is localised both in coordinate and momentum, its motion after tunneling {\em ipso facto\/} cannot be described with purely classical trajectories -- in contrast to popular models in the literature.

abstract: Given the multitude of applications of vector vortex beams there is a need for robust tools to measure them. Here we exploit the non-separability of such beams, akin to entanglement of quantum states, to apply tools traditionally associated with quantum measurements to these classical fields. We apply three measures of non-separability: a Bell inequality, a concurrence, and an entanglement entropy to define the "vectorness" of such beams. In addition to providing novel tools for the analysis of vector beams, we also introduce the concept of classical entanglement to explain why these tools are appropriate in the first place.

abstract: The earlier approach is used for description of qubits and geometric phase parameters, the things critical in the area of topological quantum computing. The used tool, Geometric (Clifford) Algebra is the most convenient formalism for that case. Generalization of formal complex plane to an an arbitrary plane in three dimensions and of usual Hopf fibration to the map generated by an arbitrary unit value element of even sub-algebra of the three-dimensional Geometric Algebra are resulting in more profound description of qubits compared to quantum mechanical Hilbert space formalism.

The tools and techniques of attosecond science enable detailed investigations of a relatively unexplored regime of nondestructive strong-field effects. Such extremely nonlinear effects may be utilized to steer electron motion with precisely controlled optical fields and switch electric currents at a rate that is far beyond the capabilities of conventional electronics.

abstract: A method for realizing asymmetric (one-way) transmission of discretized light in modulated, linear and purely passive optical lattices is suggested, which exploits the idea of unidirectional coherent perfect absorption. The system consists of a linear photonic lattice of coupled resonators or waveguides, side coupled to a chain of lossy elements, in which light can avoid the occupation of the dissipative sites when propagating in one way, but not in the opposite one. Non-reciprocity requires modulation of the resonator/waveguide parameters, realizing a dissipative optical Aharonov-Bohm diode with non-reciprocal behavior.

abstract: The application of quasiperiodic AlGaAs superlattices as a nonlinear element of the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuromorphic network is proposed and theoretically investigated on the example of Fibonacci and figurate superlattices. The sequences of symbols for the figurate superlattices were produced by decomposition of the Fibonacci superlattices' symbolic sequences. A length of each segment of the decomposition was equal to the corresponding figurate number. It is shown that a nonlinear network based upon Fibonacci and figurate superlattices provides better parallel filtration of a half-tone picture than a network based upon traditional diodes which have cubic voltage-current characteristics. It was found that the figurate superlattice F011(1) as a nonlinear network's element provides the filtration error almost twice less than the conventional "cubic" diode. These advantages are explained by a wavelike shape of the decreasing part of the quasiperiodic superlattice's voltage-current characteristic, which leads to multistability of the network's cell. This multistability promises new interesting nonlinear dynamical phenomena. A variety of wavy forms of voltage-current characteristics opens up new interesting possibilities for quasiperiodic superlattices and especially for figurate superlattices in many areas - from nervous system modeling to nonlinear control systems development

abstract: In this paper, we discuss a general procedure by which nonlinear power spectral densities (PSDs) of the harmonic oscillator can be calculated in both the quantum and classical regimes. We begin with an introduction of the damped and undamped classical harmonic oscillator, followed by an overview of the quantum mechanical description of this system. A brief review of both the classical and quantum autocorrelation functions (ACFs) and PSDs follow. We then introduce a general method by which the $k$th-order PSD for the harmonic oscillator can be calculated, where $k$ is any positive integer. This formulation is verified by first reproducing the known results for the $k=1$ case of the linear PSD. It is then extended to calculate the second-order PSD, useful in the field of quantum measurement, corresponding to the $k=2$ case of the generalized method. In this process, damping is included into each of the quantum linear and quadratic PSDs, producing realistic models for the PSDs found in experiment. These quantum PSDs are shown to obey the correspondence principle by matching with what was calculated for their classical counterparts in the high temperature, high-$Q$ limit. Finally, we demonstrate that our results can be reproduced using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, providing an independent check of our resultant PSDs.

abstract: In this paper it is argued that Barad's Agential Realism, an approach to quantum mechanics originating in the philosophy of Niels Bohr, can be the basis of a 'theory of everything' consistent with a proposal of Wheeler that observer-participancy is the foundation of everything. On the one hand, agential realism can be grounded in models of self-organisation such as the hypercycles of Eigen, while on the other agential realism, by virtue of the 'discursive practices' that constitute one aspect of the theory, implies the possibility of the generation of physical phenomena through acts of specification originating at a more fundamental level. Included in phenomena that may be generated by such a mechanism are the origin and evolution of life, and human capacities such as mathematical and musical intuition.

abstract: Chiral edge states are a hallmark of quantum Hall physics. In electronic systems, they appear as a macroscopic consequence of the cyclotron orbits induced by a magnetic field, which are naturally truncated at the physical boundary of the sample. Here we report on the experimental realization of chiral edge states in a ribbon geometry with an ultracold gas of neutral fermions subjected to an artificial gauge field. By imaging individual sites along a synthetic dimension, we detect the existence of the edge states, investigate the onset of chirality as a function of the bulk-edge coupling, and observe the edge-cyclotron orbits induced during a quench dynamics. The realization of fermionic chiral edge states is a fundamental achievement, which opens the door towards experiments including edge state interferometry and the study of non-Abelian anyons in atomic systems.

abstract: We engineered a two-dimensional magnetic lattice in an elongated strip geometry, with effective per-plaquette flux ~4/3 times the flux quanta. We imaged the localized edge and bulk states of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in this strip, with single lattice-site resolution along the narrow direction. Further, we observed both the skipping orbits of excited atoms traveling down our system's edges, analogues to edge magnetoplasmons in 2-D electron systems, and a dynamical Hall effect for bulk excitations. Our lattice's long direction consisted of the sites of an optical lattice and its narrow direction consisted of the internal atomic spin states. Our technique has minimal heating, a feature that will be important for spectroscopic measurements of the Hofstadter butterfly and realizations of Laughlin's charge pump.

abstract: Particles in space periodic potentials constitute standard models for investigation of crystalline phenomena in solid state physics. Time periodicity of periodically driven systems is a close analogue of space periodicity of solid state crystals. There is an intriguing question if solid state phenomena can be observed in the time domain. Here we show that wave-packets localized on resonant classical trajectories of periodically driven systems are ideal elements to realize Anderson localization or Mott insulator phase in the time domain. Uniform superpositions of the wave-packets form stationary states of a periodically driven particle. However, an additional perturbation that fluctuates in time results in disorder in time and Anderson localization effects emerge. Switching to many-particle systems we observe that depending on how strong particle interactions are, stationary states can be Bose-Einstein condensates or single Fock states where definite numbers of particles occupy the periodically evolving wave-packets. Our study shows that non-trivial crystal-like phenomena can be observed in the time domain.

abstract: We propose a new method to identify transitions from a topological insulator to a band insulator in silicene (the silicon equivalent of graphene) in the presence of perpendicular magnetic and electric fields, by using the R\'enyi-Wehrl entropy of the quantum state in phase space. Electron-hole entropies display an inversion/crossing behavior at the charge neutrality point for any Landau level, and the combined entropy of particles plus holes turns out to be maximum at this critical point. The result is interpreted in terms of delocalization of the quantum state in phase space. The entropic description presented in this work will be valid in general 2D gapped Dirac materials, with a strong intrinsic spin-orbit interaction, isoestructural with silicene.

abstract: Due to underlying symmetries the ground states of magnetic adatoms may be highly stable, which opens perspectives for application as single-atom memory. A specific example is a single holmium atom (with $J=8$) on a platinum (111) surface for which exceptionally long lifetimes were observed in recent scanning tunneling microscopy studies. For control and read-out the atom must be coupled to electronic contacts. Hence the spin dynamics of the system is governed by a quantum master equation. Our analysis shows that in general it cannot be reduced to a classical master equation in the basis of the unperturbed crystal-field Hamiltonian. Rather, depending on parameters and control fields, "environment induced superselection" principles choose the appropriate set of basis states, which in turn determines the specific relaxation channels and lifetimes. Our simulations suggest that in ideal situations the lifetimes should be even longer than observed in the experiment. We, therefore, investigate the influence of various perturbations. We also study the initialization process of the state of the Ho atom by applied voltage pulses and conclude that fast, high fidelity preparation, on a $100\,\text{ns}$ timescale, should be possible.

abstract: In this work, the quantum confinement effect is proposed as the cause of the displacement of the vibrational spectrum of molecular groups that involve hydrogen bonds. In this approach the hydrogen bond imposes a space barrier to hydrogen and constrains its oscillatory motion. We studied the vibrational transitions through the Morse potential, for the NH and OH molecular groups inside macromolecules in situation of confinement (when hydrogen bonding is formed) and non-confinement (when there is no hydrogen bonding). The energies were obtained through the variational method with the trial wave functions obtained from Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SQM) formalism. The results indicate that it is possible to distinguish the emission peaks related to the existence of the hydrogen bonds. These analytical results were satisfactorily compared with experimental results obtained from infrared spectroscopy.

abstract: We present a laser system based on a 48 cm long optical glass resonator. The large size requires a sophisticated thermal control and optimized mounting design. A self balancing mounting was essential to reliably reach sensitivities to acceleration of below $\Delta \nu / \nu$ < 2E-10 /g in all directions. Furthermore, fiber noise cancellations from a common reference point near the laser diode to the cavity mirror and to additional user points (Sr clock and frequency comb) are implemented. Through comparison to other cavity-stabilized lasers and to a strontium lattice clock an instability of below 1E-16 at averaging times from 1 s to 1000 s is revealed.

abstract: The investigation of energy transfer properties in photosynthetic multi-protein networks gives insight into their underlying design principles.Here, we discuss excitonic energy transfer mechanisms of the photosystem II (PS-II) C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$ supercomplex, which is the largest isolated functional unit of the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants.Despite the lack of a decisive energy gradient in C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$, we show that the energy transfer is directed by relaxation to low energy states. C$_2$S$_2$M$_2$ is not organized to form pathways with strict energetic downhill transfer, which has direct consequences on the transfer efficiency, transfer pathways and transfer limiting steps. The exciton dynamics is sensitive to small structural changes, which, for instance, are induced by the reorganization of vibrational coordinates. In order to incorporate the reorganization process in our numerical simulations, we go beyond rate equations and use the hierarchically coupled equation of motion approach (HEOM). While transfer from the peripherical antenna to the proteins in proximity to the reaction center occurs on a faster time scale, the final step of the energy transfer to the RC core is rather slow, and thus the limiting step in the transfer chain. Our findings suggest that the structure of the PS-II supercomplex guarantees photoprotection rather than optimized efficiency.

abstract: External driving is emerging as a promising tool for exploring new phases in quantum systems. The intrinsically non-equilibrium states that result, however, are challenging to describe and control. We study the steady states of a periodically driven one-dimensional electronic system, including the effects of radiative recombination, electron-phonon interactions, and the coupling to an external fermionic reservoir. Using a kinetic equation for the populations of the Floquet eigenstates, we show that the steady-state distribution can be controlled using the momentum and energy relaxation pathways provided by the coupling to phonon and Fermi reservoirs. In order to utilize the latter, we propose to couple the system and reservoir via an energy filter which suppresses photon-assisted tunneling. Importantly, coupling to these reservoirs yields a steady state resembling a band insulator in the Floquet basis. The system exhibits incompressible behavior, while hosting a small density of excitations. We discuss transport signatures, and describe the regimes where insulating behavior is obtained. Our results give promise for realizing Floquet topological insulators.

Being based on low-reflectivity micromirrors fabricated on a silicon cantilever, our experimental arrangement provides broadband operation, tunability of the cavity resonance, lateral scanning and promise for optomechanical studies.

abstract: In the literature, there exist several interesting hybrid models of finite automata which have both quantum and classical states. We call them semi-quantum automata. In this paper, we compare the descriptional power of these models with that of DFA. Specifically, we present a uniform method that gives a lower bound on the size of the three existing main models of semi-quantum automata, and this bound shows that semi-quantum automata can be at most exponentially more concise than DFA. Compared with a recent work (Bianchi, Mereghetti, Palano, Theoret. Comput. Sci., 551(2014), 102-115), our method shows the following two advantages: (i) our method is much more concise; and (ii) our method is universal, since it is applicable to the three existing main models of semi-quantum automata, instead of only a specific model.

abstract: We investigate structural properties of the completely positive semidefinite cone $\mathcal{CS}_+^n$, consisting of all the $n \times n$ symmetric matrices that admit a Gram representation by positive semidefinite matrices of any size. This cone has been introduced to model quantum graph parameters as conic optimization problems. Recently it has also been used to characterize the set $\mathcal Q$ of bipartite quantum correlations, as projection of an affine section of it. We have two main results concerning the structure of the completely positive semidefinite cone, namely about its interior and about its closure. On the one hand we construct a hierarchy of polyhedral cones which covers the interior of $\mathcal{CS}_+^n$, which we use for computing some variants of the quantum chromatic number by way of a linear program. On the other hand we give an explicit description of the closure of the completely positive semidefinite cone, by showing that it consists of all matrices admitting a Gram representation in the tracial ultraproduct of matrix algebras.

abstract: Repeated measurements as typically occurring in two-time correlators rely on von Neumann's projection postulate, telling how to restart the system after a measurement. We describe an alternative procedure where co-evolving quantum memories extract system information through entanglement, combined with a final readout of the memories according to Born's rule. We apply this procedure to the calculation of the electron charge correlator in mesoscopic physics and the photon intensity correlator in quantum optics. While our approach to repeated quantum measurements deals with any system-memory coupling, we show that the limits of strong (weak) measurements are correctly reproduced at strong (weak) coupling.

abstract: We study the real-time evolution of large open quantum spin systems in two spatial dimensions, whose dynamics is entirely driven by a dissipative coupling to the environment. We consider different dissipative processes and investigate the real-time evolution from an ordered phase of the Heisenberg or XY-model towards a disordered phase at late times. The corresponding Kossakowski-Lindblad equation is solved via an efficient cluster algorithm. We find that the symmetry of the dissipative process determines the time scales which govern the approach towards a new equilibrium phase at late times. Most notably, we find a slow equilibration if the dissipative process conserves any of the magnetization Fourier modes. In these cases, the dynamics can be interpreted as a diffusion process of the conserved quantity.

abstract: Thermodynamic properties of the one-dimensional (1D) quantum well (QW) with miscellaneous permutations of the Dirichlet (D) and Neumann (N) boundary conditions (BCs) at its edges in the perpendicular to the surfaces electric field $\mathscr{E}$ are calculated. For the canonical ensemble, analytical expressions involving theta functions are found for the mean energy and heat capacity $c_V$ for the box with no applied voltage. Pronounced maximum accompanied by the adjacent minimum of the specific heat dependence on the temperature $T$ for the pure Neumann QW and their absence for other BCs are predicted and explained by the structure of the corresponding energy spectrum. Applied field leads to the increase of the heat capacity and formation of the new or modification of the existing extrema what is qualitatively described by the influence of the associated electric potential. A remarkable feature of the Fermi grand canonical ensemble is, at any BC combination in zero fields, a salient maximum of $c_V$ observed on the $T$ axis for one particle and its absence for any other number $N$ of corpuscles. Qualitative and quantitative explanation of this phenomenon employs the analysis of the chemical potential and its temperature dependence for different $N$. It is proved that critical temperature $T_{cr}$ of the Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation increases with the applied voltage for any number of particles and for any BC permutation except the ND case at small intensities $\mathscr{E}$ what is explained again by the modification by the field of the interrelated energies. It is shown that even for the temperatures smaller than $T_{cr}$ the total dipole moment $\langle P\rangle$ may become negative for the quite moderate $\mathscr{E}$. For either Fermi or BE system, the influence of the electric field on the heat capacity is shown to be suppressed with $N$ growing.

abstract: Analytical solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the one-dimensional quantum well with all possible permutations of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions (BCs) in perpendicular to the interfaces uniform electric field $\mathscr{E}$ are used for the comparative investigation of their interaction and its influence on the properties of the system. Limiting cases of the weak and strong voltages allow an easy mathematical treatment and its clear physical explanation; in particular, for the small $\mathscr{E}$, the perturbation theory derives for all geometries a linear dependence of the polarization on the field with the BC-dependent proportionality coefficient being positive (negative) for the ground (excited) states. Simple two-level approximation elementary explains the negative polarizations as a result of the field-induced destructive interference of the unperturbed modes and shows that in this case the admixture of only the neighboring states plays a dominant role. Different magnitudes of the polarization for different BCs in this regime are explained physically and confirmed numerically. Hellmann-Feynman theorem reveals a fundamental relation between the polarization and the speed of the energy change with the field. It is proved that zero-voltage position entropies $S_x$ are BC independent and for all states but the ground Neumann level (which has $S_x=0$) are equal to $\ln2-1$ while the momentum entropies $S_k$ depend on the edge requirements and the level. Varying electric field changes position and momentum entropies in the opposite directions such that the entropic uncertainty relation is satisfied.

abstract: In a recent paper [I. Brevik and S. Ellingsen, Phys. Rev. A 81, 063830 (2010)], a conventional general electromagnetic force definition is used for calculations of Abraham radiation torque produced by the whispering gallery mode in a micrometer-sized dielectric spherical resonator. However in this paper, we would like to indicate that this conventional force definition is flawed; namely the physical existence of the Abraham-term force in the definition is questionable.

abstract: In the present paper, it is shown that the existence of the Casimir electromotive force (EMF) is possible in nanosized configurations with nonclosed nonparallel metal plates. The nature of such EMF is associated with the drag current generation at the noncompensated Casimir action of virtual photons on the electrons in the nano-configurations. In the case of a classical configuration withstrictly parallel plates, EMF is not generated. However, EMF can be generated when even an insignificant angle between the plates appears. Angles between the plates and their effective lengths have been found, at which maximally possible EMF is generated in a configuration.

abstract: We show that certain singularities of the Hamiltonian in the complex wave vector space can be used to identify topological quantum phase transitions for $1D$ chiral topological superconductors/superfluids in the BDI class. These singularities fall into the category of the so-called exceptional points ($EP$'s) studied in the context of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing open quantum systems. We also propose a generic formula in terms of the properties of the $EP$'s to quantify the exact number of Majorana zero modes in a particular chiral topological superconducting phase, given the values of the parameters appearing in the Hamiltonian. This formula serves as an alternative to the familiar integer ($\mathbb{Z}$) winding number invariant characterizing topological superconductor/superfluid phases in the chiral BDI class.

abstract: The Dicke subradiance and superradiance resulting from the interaction between surface plasmons of a nanosphere and an ensemble of quantum emitters have been investigated using a Green function approach. Based on such an investigation, we propose a scheme for a deterministic multiqubit quantum phase gate. As an example, twoqubit, threequbit, and fourqubit quantum phase gates have been designed and analyzed in detail. Phenomena due to the losses in the metal are discussed. Potential applications of these phenomena to quantuminformation processing are anticipated.

abstract: We construct an optimal set of single-particle states for few-electron quantum dots (QDs) using the method of natural orbitals (NOs). The NOs include also the effects of the Coulomb repulsion between electrons. We find that they agree well with the noniteracting orbitals for GaAs QDs of realistic parameters, while the Coulomb interactions only rescale the radius of the NOs compared to the noninteracting case. We use NOs to show that four-electron QDs are less susceptible to charge noise than their two-electron counterparts.

abstract: We report on the time dependent solutions of the $q-$generalized Schr\"odinger equation proposed by Nobre et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 140601 (2011)]. Here we investigate the case of two free particles and also the case where two particles were subjected to a Moshinsky-like potential with time dependent coefficients. We work out analytical and numerical solutions for different values of the parameter $q$ and also show that the usual Schr\"odinger equation is recovered in the limit of $q\rightarrow 1$. An intriguing behavior was observed for $q=2$, where the wave function displays a ring-like shape, indicating a bind behavior of the particles. Differently from the results previously reported for the case of one particle, frozen states appear only for special combinations of the wave function parameters in case of $q=3$.

abstract: The relativistic scattering of spin-0 bosons by spherically symmetric Coulomb fields is analyzed in detail with an arbitrary mixing of vector and scalar couplings. It is shown that the partial wave series reduces the scattering amplitude to the closed Rutherford formula exactly when the vector and scalar potentials have the same magnitude, and as an approximation for weak fields. The behavior of the scattering amplitude near the conditions that furnish its closed form is also discussed. Strong suppressions of the scattering amplitude when the vector and scalar potentials have the same magnitude are observed either for particles or antiparticles with low incident momentum. We point out that such strong suppressions might be relevant in the analysis of the scattering of fermions near the conditions for the spin and pseudospin symmetries. From the complex poles of the partial scattering amplitude the exact closed form of bound-state solutions for both particles and antiparticles with different scenarios for the coupling constants are obtained. Perturbative breaking of the accidental degeneracy appearing in a pair of special cases is related to the nonconservation of the Runge-Lenz vector.

abstract: In Levin-Wen (LW) models, a wide class of exactly solvable discrete models, for two dimensional topological phases, it is relatively easy to describe single fluxon excitations, but not the charge and dyonic as well as many-fluxon excitations. To incorporate charged and dyonic excitations in (doubled) topological phases, a generalization of the LW models is proposed in this paper. We first enlarge the Hilbert space with adding a tail on one of the edges of each trivalent vertex, to describe its internal charge degrees of freedom. Then we study the full dyon spectrum of generalized LW models, including both quantum numbers and wave functions for dyonic quasiparticle excitations. The local operators associated with the dyonic excitations are shown to form the so-called Tube algebra, whose representations (modules) form the quantum double (categoric center) of the input data (unitary fusion category). In physically relevant cases, the input data is from a finite or quantum group (with braiding $R$-matrices), we find that the elementary excitations (or dyon species), as well as any localized/isolated excited states, are characterized by three quantum numbers: charge, fluxon type, and twist. They provide a "complete basis" for many-body states in the enlarged Hilbert space. Concrete examples are presented and the relevance of our results to the electric-magnetic duality is discussed.

abstract: A new quantum effect connected with the late time behavior of decaying states is described and its possible observational consequences are analyzed: It is shown that charged unstable particles as well as neutral unstable particles with non--zero magnetic moment which live sufficiently long may emit electromagnetic radiation. This mechanism is due to the nonclassical behavior of unstable particles at late times (at the post exponential time region). Analyzing the transition times region between exponential and non-exponential form of the survival amplitude it is found that the instantaneous energy of the unstable particle can take very large values, much larger than the energy of this state at times from the exponential time region. Based on the results obtained for the model considered, it is shown that this new purely quantum mechanical effect may be responsible for causing unstable particles produced by astrophysical sources and moving with relativistic velocities to emit electromagnetic--, $X$-- or $\gamma$--rays at some time intervals from the transition time regions.

abstract: We develop a microscopic theory describing a quantum impurity whose rotational degree of freedom is coupled to a many-particle bath. We approach the problem by introducing the concept of an 'angulon' - a quantum rotor dressed by a quantum field - and reveal its quasiparticle properties using a combination of variational and diagrammatic techniques. Our theory predicts renormalisation of the impurity rotational structure, such as observed in experiments with molecules in superfluid helium droplets, in terms of a rotational Lamb shift induced by the many-particle environment. Furthermore, we discover a rich many-body-induced fine structure, emerging in rotational spectra due to a redistribution of angular momentum within the quantum many-body system.

abstract: It is commonly believed that the fidelity of quantum teleportation using localized quantum objects with one party or both accelerated in vacuum would be degraded due to the heat-up by the Unruh effect. In this paper we point out that the Unruh effect is not the whole story in accounting for all the relativistic effects in quantum teleportation. First, there could be degradation of fidelity by a common field environment even when both quantum objects are in inertial motion. Second, relativistic effects entering the description of the dynamics such as frame dependence, time dilation, and Doppler shift, already existent in inertial motion, can compete with or even overwhelm the effect due to uniform acceleration in a quantum field. We show it is not true that larger acceleration of an object would necessarily lead to a faster degradation of fidelity. These claims are based on four cases of quantum teleportation we studied using two Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled via a common quantum field initially in the Minkowski vacuum. We find the quantum entanglement evaluated around the light cone, rather than the conventional ones evaluated on the Minkowski time-slices, is the necessary condition for the averaged fidelity of quantum teleportation beating the classical one. These results are useful as a guide to making judicious choices of states and parameter ranges and estimation of the efficiency of quantum teleportation in relativistic quantum systems under environmental influences.

abstract: A coherent-classical estimation scheme for a class of linear quantum systems is considered. Here, the estimator is a mixed quantum-classical system that may or may not involve coherent feedback and yields a classical estimate of a variable for the quantum plant. We demonstrate that with no coherent feedback, such coherent-classical estimation provides no improvement over purely-classical estimation, when the quantum plant or the quantum part of the estimator (called the coherent controller) is a passive annihilation operator system. However, when both the quantum plant and the coherent controller are active systems (that cannot be described by annihilation operators only), coherent-classical estimation without coherent feedback can provide improvement over purely-classical estimation in certain cases. Furthermore, we show that with coherent feedback, it is possible to get better estimation accuracies with coherent-classical estimation, as compared to classical-only estimation.

abstract: Recent investigations have revealed powerful selection rules for resonant energy transfer between modes of non-linear perturbations in global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. It is likely that these selection rules are due to the highly symmetric nature of the underlying AdS background, though the precise relation has remained unclear. In this article, we demonstrate that the equation satisfied by the scalar field mode functions in AdS(d+1) has a hidden SU(d) symmetry, and explicitly specify the multiplets of this SU(d) symmetry furnished by the mode functions. We also comment on the role this structure might play in explaining the selection rules.

abstract: We present a compact atomic clock interrogating ultracold 87Rb magnetically trapped on an atom chip. Very long coherence times sustained by spin self-rephasing allow us to interrogate the atomic transition with 85% contrast at 5 s Ramsey time. The clock exhibits a fractional frequency stability of $5.8\times 10^{-13}$ at 1 s and is likely to integrate into the $1\times10^{-15}$ range in less than a day. A detailed analysis of 7 noise sources explains the measured frequency stability. Fluctuations in the atom temperature (0.4 nK shot-to-shot) and in the offset magnetic field ($5\times10^{-6}$ relative fluctuations shot-to-shot) are the main noise sources together with the local oscillator, which is degraded by the 30% duty cycle. The analysis suggests technical improvements to be implemented in a future second generation set-up. The results demonstrate the remarkable degree of technical control that can be reached in an atom chip experiment.

abstract: We prove that the continuity of the maximum-entropy inference which refers to two quantum observables is equivalent to the strong continuity of vectors in the pre-image of the numerical range. A new condition for the continuity of the maximum-entropy inference, depending on analytic eigenfunctions, follows as a corollary. The condition implies that discontinuities are rare for two observables. A second corollary is that the continuity of the MaxEnt inference method is independent of the prior.

abstract: We study measures of decoherence and thermalization of a quantum system $S$ in the presence of a quantum environment (bath) $E$. The whole system is prepared in a canonical thermal state at a finite temperature. Applying perturbation theory with respect to the system-environment coupling strength, we find that under common Hamiltonian symmetries, up to first order in the coupling strength it is sufficient to consider the uncoupled system to predict decoherence and thermalization measures of $S$. This decoupling allows closed form expressions for perturbative expansions for the measures of decoherence and thermalization in terms of the free energies of $S$ and of $E$. Numerical results for both coupled and decoupled systems with up to 40 quantum spins validate these findings.

abstract: Singular behavior of the Laplace operator in spherical coordinates is investigated. It is shown that in course of transition to the reduced radial wave function in the Schrodinger equation there appears additional term consisting the Dirac delta function, which was unnoted during the full history of physics and mathematics. The possibility of avoiding this contribution from the reduced radial equation is discussed. It is demonstrated that for this aim the necessary and sufficient condition is requirement the fast enough falling of the wave function at the origin. The result does not depend on character of potential:is it regular or singular. The various manifestations and consequences of this observation are considered as well. The cornerstone in our approach is the natural requirement that the solution of the radial equation at the same time must obey to the full equation.

abstract: We report a theoretical study of a quantum optical model consisting of an array of strongly nonlinear cavities incoherently pumped by an ensemble of population-inverted two-level atoms. Projective methods are used to eliminate the atomic dynamics and write a generalized master equation for the photonic degrees of freedom only, where the frequency-dependence of gain introduces non-Markovian features. In the simplest single cavity configuration, this pumping scheme allows for the selective generation of Fock states with a well-defined photon number. For many cavities in a weakly non-Markovian limit, the non-equilibrium steady state recovers a Grand-Canonical statistical ensemble at a temperature determined by the effective atomic linewidth. For a two-cavity system in the strongly nonlinear regime, signatures of a Mott state with one photon per cavity are found.

We use two techniques to reduce losses associated with two-level systems: an additional substrate surface treatment prior to NbTiN deposition to optimize the metal-substrate interface, and deep reactive-ion etching of the substrate to displace the substrate-vacuum interfaces away from high electric fields. The temperature and power dependence of resonator behavior indicate that two-level systems still contribute significantly to energy dissipation, suggesting that more interface optimization could further improve performance.

abstract: The definition of the Hamiltonian operator H for a general wave equa-tion in a general spacetime is discussed. We recall that H depends on the coordinate system merely through the corresponding reference frame. When the wave equation involves a gauge choice and the gauge change is time-dependent, H as an operator depends on the gauge choice. This dependence extends to the energy operator E, which is the Hermitian part of H. We distinguish between this ambiguity issue of E and the one that occurs due to a mere change of the "represen-tation" (e.g. transforming the Dirac wave function from the "Dirac representation" to a "Foldy-Wouthuysen representation"). We also assert that the energy operator ought to be well defined in a given ref-erence frame at a given time, e.g. by comparing the situation for this operator with the main features of the energy for a classical Hamilto-nian particle.

abstract: Unstable separatrix solutions for the first and second Painlev\'e transcendents are studied both numerically and analytically. For a fixed initial condition, say $y(0)=0$, there is a discrete set of initial slopes $y'(0)=b_n$ that give rise to separatrix solutions. Similarly, for a fixed initial slope, say $y'(0)= 0$, there is a discrete set of initial values $y(0)=c_n$ that give rise to separatrix solutions. For Painlev\'e I the large-$n$ asymptotic behavior of $b_n$ is $b_n\sim B_{\rm I}n^{3/5}$ and that of $c_n$ is $c_n\sim C_{\rm I}n^{2/ 5}$, and for Painlev\'e II the large-$n$ asymptotic behavior of $b_n$ is $b_n \sim B_{\rm II}n^{2/3}$ and that of $c_n$ is $c_n\sim C_{\rm II}n^{1/3}$. The constants $B_{\rm I}$, $C_{\rm I}$, $B_{\rm II}$, and $C_{\rm II}$ are first determined numerically. Then, they are found analytically and in closed form by reducing the nonlinear equations to the linear eigenvalue problems associated with the cubic and quartic PT-symmetric Hamiltonians $H=\frac{1}{2}p^2+2ix^3$ and $H=\frac{1}{2}p^2-\frac{1}{2}x^4$.

abstract: We study the propagation of guided light along an array of three-level atoms in the vicinity of an optical nanofiber under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency. We examine two schemes of atomic levels and field polarizations where the guided probe field is quasilinearly polarized along the major or minor principal axis, which is parallel or perpendicular, respectively, to the radial direction of the atomic position. Our numerical calculations indicate that 200 cesium atoms in a linear array with a length of 100 $\mu$m at a distance of 200 nm from the surface of a nanofiber with a radius of 250 nm can slow down the speed of guided probe light by a factor of about $3.5\times 10^6$ (the corresponding group delay is about 1.17 $\mu$s). In the neighborhood of the Bragg resonance, a significant fraction of the guided probe light can be reflected back with a negative group delay. The reflectivity and the group delay of the reflected field do not depend on the propagation direction of the probe field. However, when the input guided light is quasilinearly polarized along the major principal axis, the transmittivity and the group delay of the transmitted field substantially depend on the propagation direction of the probe field. Under the Bragg resonance condition, an array of atoms prepared in an appropriate internal state can transmit guided light polarized along the major principal in one specific direction even in the limit of infinitely large atom numbers. The directionality of transmission of guided light through the array of atoms is a consequence of the existence of a longitudinal component of the guided light field as well as the ellipticity of both the field polarization and the atomic dipole vector.

We pay particular attention to counterintuitive or anomalous regimes, such as when the atomic motion is opposite to that of the lattice.

abstract: We focus on the issue of proper definition of entanglement entropy in lattice gauge theories, and examine a naive definition where gauge invariant states are viewed as elements of an extended Hilbert space which contains gauge non-invariant states as well. Working in the extended Hilbert space, we can define entanglement entropy associated with an arbitrary subset of links, not only for abelian but also for non-abelian theories. We then derive the associated replica formula. We also discuss the issue of gauge invariance of the entanglement entropy. In the $Z_N$ gauge theories in arbitrary space dimensions, we show that all the standard properties of the entanglement entropy, e.g. the strong subadditivity, hold in our definition. We study the entanglement entropy for special states, including the topological states for the $Z_N$ gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. We discuss relations of our definition to other proposals.

abstract: An argument by Banks, Susskind and Peskin (BSP), according to which violation of unitarity would violate either locality or energy-momentum conservation, is widely believed to be a strong argument against non-unitarity of Hawking radiation. We find that the whole BSP argument rests on the crucial assumption that the Hamiltonian is not highly degenerate, and point out that this assumption is not satisfied for systems with many degrees of freedom. Using Lindblad equation, we show that high degeneracy of the Hamiltonian allows local non-unitary evolution without violating energy-momentum conservation. Moreover, since energy-momentum is the source of gravity, we argue that energy-momentum is necessarily conserved for a large class of non-unitary systems with gravity. Finally, we explicitly calculate the Lindblad operators for non-unitary Hawking radiation and show that they conserve energy-momentum.

abstract: While different ways to realize spin-orbit coupling in Bose-Einstein condensates exist, not all are currently experimentally implementable. Here we present a detailed study of gap solitons in a Bose- Einstein condensate with experimentally realizable spin-orbit coupling and discuss two cases relating to a spin-dependent parity symmetry. In the parity symmetric case, two families of fundamental gap solitons in second linear energy gap are demonstrated with opposite sign of the parity, with one family having single humped densities and the other double humped ones. In the case of broken parity symmetry, the fundamental modes manifest spin-polarization. Both families possess an opposite sign of the spin-polarization.

abstract: We have presented here the consequences of the non-uniform exchange field on the spin transport issues in spin chiral configuration of ferromagnetic graphene. Taking resort to the spin orbit coupling (SOC) term and non-uniform exchange coupling term we are successful to express the expression of Hall conductivity in terms of the exchange field and SOC parameters through the Kubo formula approach. However, for a specific configuration of the exchange parameter we have evaluated the Berry curvature of the system. We also have paid attention to the study of SU(2) gauge theory of ferromagnetic graphene. The generation of anti damping spin orbit torque in spin chiral magnetic graphene is also briefly discussed.

abstract: The interference between optical beams of different polarizations plays a fundamental role in reproducing the optical analog of the electron spin weak measurement. The extraordinary point in optical weak measurements is represented by the possibility to estimate with great accuracy the Goos-Haenchen (GH) shift by measuring the distance between the peak of the outgoing beams for two opposite rotation angles of the polarizers located before and after the dielectric block. Starting from the numerical calculation of the GH shift, which clearly shows a frequency crossover for incidence near to the critical angle, we present a detailed study of the interference between s and p polarized waves in the critical region. This allows to determine in which conditions it is possible to avoid axial deformations and reproduce the GH curves. In view of a possible experimental implementation, we give the expected weak measurement curves for Gaussian lasers of different beam waist sizes propagating through borosilicate (BK7) and fused silica dielectric blocks.

abstract: The equivalence postulate approach to quantum mechanics aims to formulate quantum mechanics from a fundamental geometrical principle. Underlying the formulation there exists a basic cocycle condition which is invariant under $D$--dimensional M\"obius transformations with respect to the Euclidean or Minkowski metrics. The invariance under global M\"obius transformations implies that spatial space is compact. Furthermore, it implies energy quantisation and undefinability of quantum trajectories without assuming any prior interpretation of the wave function. The approach may be viewed as conventional quantum mechanics with the caveat that spatial space is compact, as dictated by the M\"obius symmetry, with the classical limit corresponding to the decompactification limit. Correspondingly, there exists a finite length scale in the formalism and consequently an intrinsic regularisation scheme. Evidence for the compactness of space may exist in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

abstract: Point defects in classical and quantum solids such as vacancies and interstitials attract each other, independently of the details of the particle interaction. This invariably leads to phase separation between perfect crystalline structures and defect conglomerates at low temperatures. Here, we propose that effective interactions between point defects can be tuned from attractive to repulsive by means of external periodic fields. In the quantum regime, this allows one to engineer strongly-correlated many-body phases. We exemplify the microscopic mechanism by considering polar molecules trapped in a weak optical lattice in a two-dimensional crystalline configuration. By tuning the lattice depth, defect interactions turn repulsive, which allows us to deterministically design a novel supersolid phase in the continuum limit, with favorable experimental parameters.

abstract: The generalized uncertainty principles (GUP) and modified dispersion relations (MDR) are much like two faces for one coin in research for the phenomenology of quantum gravity which apparently plays an important role in estimating the possible modifications of the black hole thermodynamics and the Friedmann equations. We first reproduce the horizon area for different types of black holes and investigate the quantum corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (entropy-area law). Based on this, we study further thermodynamical quantities and accordingly the modified Friedmann equation in four-dimensional de Sitter-Schwarzschild, Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom and Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black holes. In doing this we applied various quantum gravity approaches. The MDR parameter relative to the GUP one is computed and the properties of the black holes are predicted. This should play an important role in estimating response of quantum gravity to the various metric-types of black holes. We found a considerable change in the thermodynamics quantities. We find that the modified entropy of de-Sitter-Schwarzshild and Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom black holes starts to exist at a finite standard entropy. The Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black hole shows a different entropic property. The modified specific heat due to GUP and MDR approaches vanishes at large standard specific heat, while the corrections due to GUP result in different behaviors. The specific heat of modified de-Sitter-Schwarzshild and Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom black holes seems to increase, especially at large standard specific heat. In the early case, the black hole cannot exchange heat with the surrounding space. Accordingly, we would predict black hole remnants which may be considered as candidates for dark matter.

abstract: We discuss a protocol for growing states with topological order in interacting many-body systems using a sequence of flux quanta and particle insertion. We first consider a simple toy model, the superlattice Bose Hubbard model, to explain all required ingredients. Our protocol is then applied to fractional quantum Hall systems in both, continuum and lattice. We investigate in particular how the fidelity, with which a topologically ordered state can be grown, scales with increasing particle number N. For small systems exact diagonalization methods are used. To treat large systems with many particles, we introduce an effective model based on the composite fermion description of the fractional quantum Hall effect. This model also allows to take into account the effects of dispersive bands and edges in the system, which will be discussed in detail.

abstract: The occupation of more than one single-particle state and hence the emergence of fragmentation is a many-body phenomenon universal to systems of spatially confined interacting bosons. In the present study, we investigate the effect of the range of the interparticle interactions on the fragmentation degree of one- and two-dimensional systems. We solve the full many-body Schr\"odinger equation of the system using the recursive implementation of the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons method, R-MCTDHB. The dependence of the degree of fragmentation on dimensionality, particle number, areal or line density and interaction strength is assessed. It is found that for contact interactions, the fragmentation is essentially density independent in two dimensions. However, fragmentation increasingly depends on density the more long-ranged the interactions become. The degree of fragmentation is increasing, keeping the particle number $N$ fixed, when the density is decreasing as expected in one spatial dimension. We demonstrate that this remains, nontrivially, true also for long-range interactions in two spatial dimensions. We, finally, find that within our fully self-consistent approach, the fragmentation degree, to a good approximation, decreases universally as $N^{-1/2}$ when only $N$ is varied.

abstract: We construct a rigged Hilbert space for the square integrable functions on the line L^2(R) adding to the generators of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra a new discrete operator, related to the degree of the Hermite polynomials. All together, continuous and discrete operators, constitute the generators of the projective algebra io(2. L^2(R) and the vector space of the line R are shown to be isomorphic representations of such an algebra and, as both these representations are irreducible, all operators defined on the rigged Hilbert spaces L^2(R) or R are shown to belong to the universal enveloping algebra of io(2). The procedure can be extended to orthogonal and pseudo-orthogonal spaces of arbitrary dimension by tensorialization. Circumventing all formal problems the paper proposes a kind of toy model, well defined from a mathematical point of view, of rigged Hilbert spaces where, in contrast with the Hilbert spaces, operators with different cardinality are allowed.

abstract: We theoretically evaluate the feasibility to form magnetically-tunable Feshbach molecules in collisions between fermionic $^6$Li atoms and bosonic metastable $^{174}$Yb($^3$P$_2$) atoms. In contrast to the well-studied alkali-metal atom collisions, collisions with meta-stable atoms are highly anisotropic. Our first-principle coupled-channel calculation of these collisions reveals the existence of broad Feshbach resonances due to the combined effect of anisotropic-molecular and atomic-hyperfine interactions. In order to fit our predictions to the specific positions of experimentally-observed broad resonance structures \cite{Deep2015} we optimized the shape of the short-range potentials by direct least-square fitting. This allowed us to identify the dominant resonance by its leading angular momentum quantum numbers and describe the role of collisional anisotropy in the creation and broadening of this and other resonances.

abstract: The geometry of optical lattices can be engineered allowing the study of atomic transport along paths arranged in patterns that are otherwise difficult to probe in the solid state. A question readily accessible to atomic systems is related to the speed of propagation of matter-waves as a function of the lattice geometry. To address this issue, we have investigated theoretically the quantum transport of non-interacting and weakly-interacting ultracold fermionic atoms in several 2D optical lattice geometries. We find that the triangular lattice has a higher propagation velocity compared to the square lattice, despite supporting longer paths. The body-centered square lattice has even longer paths, nonetheless the propagation velocity is yet faster. This apparent paradox arises from the mixing of the momentum states which leads to different group velocities in quantum systems. Standard band theory provides an explanation and allows for a systematic way to search and design systems with controllable matter-wave propagation. Moreover, the presence of a flat band such as in a two-leg ladder geometry leads to a dynamical density discontinuity, which contrasts the behavior of mobile and localized atoms in quantum transport. Our predictions are realizable with present experimental capability.

abstract: We study theoretically the current flow along the boundary of graphene ribbons under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field $B$. In the case of specular reflections at the boundaries, the generalized Hall resistance $R_{xy}$ shows equidistant peaks, which can be understood by classical cyclotron motion. When the strength of the magnetic field is increased, we find superimposed upon the quantum Hall plateaus anomalous resistance oscillations, which are neither periodic in $B$ (cyclotron motion) nor in $1/B$ (quantum Hall effect). The oscillations are explained by the interference between the occupied edge states, which causes beatings in $R_{xy}$. We also show that the local current flow is affected significantly by the boundary geometry. A finite edge current flows on armchair boundaries, while the current on zigzag boundaries vanishes completely. The quantum Hall staircase can be observed in the case of diffusive boundary scattering. We show that the number of spatially separated edge channels in the local current equals the number of occupied Landau levels. The edge channels in the local density of states (LDOS) are smeared out but can be made visible if only a subset of the carbon atoms is taken into account.

abstract: We compute the spectral density in the normal phase of an interacting homogenous Fermi gas using a T-matrix approximation. We fit the quasiparticle peaks of the spectral density to BCS-like dispersion relations, and extract estimates of a "pseudo-gap" energy scale and an effective Fermi-wavevector as a function of interaction strength. We find that the effective Fermi-wavevector of the quasiparticles vanishes when the inverse scattering length exceeds some positive threshold. We also find that near unitarity the quasiparticle lifetimes, estimated from the widths of the peaks in the spectral density, approach values on the order of the inverse Fermi-energy. These results are consistent with the "breakdown of Fermi liquid theory" observed in recent experiments.

abstract: We investigate a semiconductor $p$-$n$ junction in contact with superconducting leads that is operated under forward bias as a light-emitting diode. The presence of superconductivity results in a significant increase of the electroluminescence in a certain frequency window. We demonstrate that the tunneling of Cooper pairs induces an additional luminescence peak on resonance. There is a transfer of superconducting to photonic coherence which results in the emission of entangled photon pairs and squeezing of the fluctuations in the quadrature amplitudes of the emitted light. The squeezing angle can be electrically manipulated by changing the relative phase of the order parameters in the superconductors. We finally derive the conditions for lasing in the system and show that the laser threshold is reduced due to superconductivity. This shows how macroscopic coherence of a superconductor can be used to control the properties of light.

As theoretical framework, we use a field theory approach in the space-time domain within the T-matrix approximation. We establish the form of the corresponding T-matrix and address the dynamical properties of the system. As a numerical application, we consider a simple system of a weakly interacting impurity in one dimension where the interaction leads to oscillations of the impurity density. Moreover, we show that the amplitude of the oscillations can be driven by periodically switching the interaction on and off.

abstract: It has been known for a long time that light carries both linear and angular momenta parallel to the direction of propagation. However, only recently it has been pointed out that beams of light, under certain conditions, may exhibit a transverse spin angular momentum perpendicular to the propagation direction. When this happens, the electric field transported by the light rotates around an axis transverse to the beam path. Such kind of fields, although deceptively elusive, are almost ubiquitous in optics as they manifests in strongly focused beams, plasmonic fields and evanescent waves. In this work we present a general formalism describing all these phenomena. In particular, we demonstrate how to mathematically generate a wave field possessing transverse spin angular momentum density, from any arbitrarily given scalar wave field, either propagating and evanescent.

abstract: The polarization operator (tensor) for planar charged fermions in constant uniform magnetic field is calculated in the one-loop approximation of the 2+1 dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_{2+1}$) with a nonzero fermion density. We construct the Green function of the Dirac equation with a constant uniform external magnetic field in the QED$_{2+1}$ at the finite chemical potential, find the imaginary part of this Green function and then obtain the polarization tensor related to the combined contribution from real particles occupying the finite number of energy levels and magnetic field. We expect that some physical effects under consideration seem to be likely to be revealed in a monolayer graphene sample in the presence of external constant uniform magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to it.

abstract: Gaussian Klauder coherent states are discussed in the context of the infinite well quantum model, otherwise known as the particle in a box. A supersymmetric partner system is also presented, as well as a construction of coherent states in this new system. We show that these states can be chosen, in both systems to have many properties usually expected for coherent states. In particular, they yield highly localised wave packets for a short period of time, which evolve in a quasi-classical manner and which saturate approximately Heisenberg uncertainty relation. These studies are elaborated in one- and two-dimensional contexts. Finally, some relations are established between the gaussian states being mostly used here and the generalised coherent states, which are more standardly found in the literature.

abstract: Several microscopic pathways have been proposed to explain the large magnetic effects observed in organic semiconductors, but identifying and characterising which microscopic process actually influences the overall magnetic field response is challenging. Pulsed electrically-detected magnetic resonance provides an ideal platform for this task as it intrinsically monitors the charge carriers of interest and provides dynamical information which is inaccessible through conventional magnetoconductance measurements. Here we develop a general time domain theory to describe the spin-dependent reaction of exciton-charge complexes following the coherent manipulation of paramagnetic centers through electron spin resonance. A general Hamiltonian is treated, and it is shown that the transition frequencies and resonance positions of the exciton-polaron complex can be used to estimate inter-species coupling. This work also provides a general formalism for analysing multi-pulse experiments which can be used to extract relaxation and transport rates.

abstract: We have studied the energy dependence of several first scattering phases with multi-atomic object. As concrete examples representing the general trends endohedrals Neon inside C60 and Argon inside C60 are considered. It appeared that the presence of an inner atom, either Ne or Ar, qualitatively affects the scattering phases, in spite of the fact that the fullerene consists of 60 carbon atoms, while the atom staffed inside is only one. Calculations are performed in the one-electron Hartree-Fock (HF) and random phase approximation with exchange (RPAE) for the inner atom while the fullerenes shell is substituted by static potential without and with the polarization potential. It appeared that the total endohedral scattering phase is simply a sum of atomic, Ne or Ar, and fullerenes C60 phases, contrary to the intuitive assumption that the total phases on C60 and Neon inside C60 or Ar inside C60 has to be the same.

abstract: Control by dissipation, or environment engineering, constitutes an important methodology within quantum coherent control which was proposed to improve the robustness and scalability of quantum control systems. The system-environment coupling, often considered to be detrimental to quantum coherence, also provides the means to steer the system to desired states. This paper aims to develop the theory for engineering of the dissipation, based on a ground-state Lyapunov stability analysis of open quantum systems via a Heisenberg-picture approach. Algebraic conditions concerning the ground-state stability and scalability of quantum systems are obtained. In particular, Lyapunov stability conditions expressed as operator inequalities allow a purely algebraic treatment of the environment engineering problem, which facilitates the integration of quantum components into a large-scale quantum system and draws an explicit connection to the classical theory of vector Lyapunov functions and decomposition-aggregation methods for control of complex systems. The implications of the results in relation to dissipative quantum computing and state engineering are also discussed in this paper.

abstract: Due to electronic many-body effects, the ionization of a molecule can trigger ultrafast electron dynamics appearing as a migration of the created hole charge throughout the system. Here we propose a scheme for control of the charge migration dynamics with a single ultrashort laser pulse. We demonstrate by fully ab initio calculations on a molecule containing a chromophore and an amine moieties that simple pulses can be used for stopping the charge-migration oscillations and localizing the charge on the desired site of the system. We argue that this control may be used to predetermine the follow-up nuclear rearrangement and thus the molecular reactivity.

abstract: We have calculated the isotropic $C\_6$ coefficients characterizing the long-range van der Waals interaction between two identical heteronuclear alkali-metal diatomic molecules in the same arbitrary vibrational level of their ground electronic state $X^1\Sigma^+$. We consider the ten species made up of $^7$Li, $^{23}$Na, $^{39}$K, $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs. Following our previous work [M.~Lepers \textit{et.~al.}, Phys.~Rev.~A \textbf{88}, 032709 (2013)] we use the sum-over-state formula inherent to the second-order perturbation theory, composed of the contributions from the transitions within the ground state levels, from the transition between ground-state and excited state levels, and from a crossed term. These calculations involve a combination of experimental and quantum-chemical data for potential energy curves and transition dipole moments. We also investigate the case where the two molecules are in different vibrational levels and we show that the Moelwyn-Hughes approximation is valid provided that it is applied for each of the three contributions to the sum-over-state formula. Our results are particularly relevant in the context of inelastic and reactive collisions between ultracold bialkali molecules, in deeply bound or in Feshbach levels.

abstract: Utilizing a SU(2) gauge symmetry technique in the quasiclassical diffusive regime, we theoretically study finite-sized two-dimensional intrinsic spin-orbit coupled superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor (S/N/S) hybrid structures with a single spin-active interface. We consider intrinsic spin-orbit interactions (ISOIs) that are confined within the N wire and absent in the s-wave superconducting electrodes (S). Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the coupling of the ISOIs and spin moment of the spin-active interface results in maximum singlet-triplet conversion and accumulation of spin current density at the corners of the N wire nearest the spin-active interface. By solely modulating the superconducting phase difference, we show how the opposing parities of the charge and spin currents provide an effective venue to experimentally examine pure edge spin currents not accompanied by charge currents. These effects occur in the absence of externally imposed fields, and moreover are insensitive to the arbitrary orientations of the interface spin moment. The experimental implementation of these robust edge phenomena are also discussed.

abstract: We investigate the subclass of reversible functions that are self-inverse and relate them to reversible circuits that are equal to their reverse circuit, which are called palindromic circuits. We precisely determine which self-inverse functions can be realized as a palindromic circuit. For those functions that cannot be realized as a palindromic circuit, we find alternative palindromic representations that require an extra circuit line or quantum gates in their construction. Our analyses make use of involutions in the symmetric group $S_{2^n}$ which are isomorphic to self-inverse reversible function on $n$ variables.

abstract: We study the fidelity susceptibility in an antiferromagnetic spin-1 XXZ chain numerically. By using the density-matrix renormalization group method, the effects of the alternating single-site anisotropy $D$ on fidelity susceptibility are investigated. Its relation with the quantum phase transition is analyzed. It is found that the quantum phase transition from the Haldane spin liquid to periodic N\'{e}el spin solid can be well characterized by the fidelity. Finite size scaling of fidelity susceptibility shows a power-law divergence at criticality, which indicates the quantum phase transition is of second order. The results are confirmed by the second derivative of the ground-state energy. We also study the relationship between the entanglement entropy, the Schmidt gap and quantum phase transitions. Conclusions drawn from these quantum information observables agree well with each other.

abstract: Density correlations unambiguously reveal the quantum nature of matter. Here, we study correlations between measurements of density in cold-atom clouds at different times at one position, and also at two separated positions. We take into account the effects of finite-size and -duration measurements made by light beams passing through the atom cloud. We specialise to the case of Bose gases in harmonic traps above critical temperature, for weakly-perturbative measurements. For overlapping measurement regions, shot-noise correlations revive after a trap oscillation period. For non-overlapping regions, bosonic correlations dominate at long times, and propagate at finite speeds. Finally, we give a realistic measurement protocol for performing such experiments.

We find that the coupling constant $\beta$ is less than 1.9 $\times10^7$~for $n=1$ at 95\% confidence level, where $n$ is an input parameter of the self--interaction of the chameleon field $\varphi$ inversely proportional to $\varphi^n$.

abstract: We study excitonic states of an atomic impurity in a Fermi gas, i.e., bound states consisting of the impurity and a hole. Previous studies considered bound states of the impurity with particles from the Fermi sea where the holes only formed part of the particle-hole dressing. Within a two-channel model, we find that, for a wide range of parameters, excitonic states are not ground but metastable states. We further calculate the decay rates of the excitonic states to polaronic and dimeronic states and find they are long lived, scaling as $\Gamma^{\rm{Exc}}_ {\rm{Pol}} \propto (\Delta\omega)^{5.5}$ and $\Gamma^{\rm{Exc}}_ {\rm{Dim}} \propto (\Delta\omega)^{4}$. We also find that a new continuum of exciton-particle states should be considered alongside the previously known dimeron-hole continuum in spectroscopic measurements. Excitons must therefore be considered as a new ingredient in the study of metastable physics currently being explored experimentally.

abstract: Two-atom systems in small traps are of fundamental interest, first of all for understanding the role of interactions in degenerate cold gases and for the creation of quantum gates in quantum information processing with single-atom traps. One of the key quantities is the inelastic relaxation (decay) time when one of the atoms or both are in a higher hyperfine state. Here we measure this quantity in a heteronuclear system of $^{87}$Rb and $^{85}$Rb in a micro optical trap and demonstrate experimentally and theoretically the presence of both fast and slow relaxation processes, depending on the choice of the initial hyperfine states. The developed experimental method allows us to single out a particular relaxation process and, in this sense, our experiment is a "superclean platform" for collisional physics studies. Our results have also implications for engineering of quantum states via controlled collisions and creation of two-qubit quantum gates.

abstract: We investigate the influence of electrical charge noise on a resonant exchange (RX) qubit in a triple quantum dot. This RX qubit is a variation of the exchange-only spin qubit which responds to a narrow-band resonant frequency. Our noise model includes uncorrelated charge noise in each quantum dot giving rise to two independent (noisy) bias parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\Delta$. We calculate the energy splitting of the two qubit states as a function of these two bias detuning parameters to find "sweet spots", where the qubit is least susceptible to noise. Our investigation shows that such sweet spots exist within the low bias regime, in which the bias detuning parameters have the same magnitude as the hopping parameters. The location of the sweet spots in the $(\varepsilon,\Delta)$ plane depends on the hopping strength and asymmetry between the quantum dots. In the regime of weak charge noise, we identify a new favorable operating regime for the RX qubit based on these sweet spots.

abstract: An accurate measurement of the bunching of photons in the fluorescent emission from an ultracold ensemble of thermal 87Rb atoms in a steady-state magneto-optical trap is presented. Time-delayed-intensity-interferometry (TDII) performed with a 5-nanosecond time resolution yielded a second-order intensity correlation function that has the ideal value of 2 at zero delay, and that shows coherent Rabi oscillations of upto 5 full periods - much longer than the spontaneous emission lifetime of the excited state of Rb. The oscillations are damped out by ~150ns, and thereafter, as expected from a thermal source, an exponential decay is observed, enabling the determination of the temperature of the atomic ensemble. Values so obtained compare well with those determined by standard techniques. TDII thus enables a quantitative study of the coherent and incoherent dynamics, even of a large thermal ensemble of atomic emitters.

abstract: The use of hyperpolarized agents in magnetic resonance (MR), such as 13C-labeled compounds, enables powerful new imaging and detection modalities that stem from a 10,000-fold boost in signal. A major challenge for the future of the hyperpolarizaton technique is the inherently short spin relaxation times, typically < 60 seconds for 13C liquid-state compounds, which limit the time that the signal remains boosted. Here, we demonstrate that 1.1% natural abundance 13C spins in synthetic nanodiamond (ND) can be hyperpolarized at cryogenic and room temperature without the use of toxic free- radicals, and, owing to their solid-state environment, exhibit relaxation times exceeding 1 hour. Combined with the already established applications of NDs in the life-sciences as inexpensive fluorescent markers and non-cytotoxic substrates for gene and drug delivery, these results extend the theranostic capabilities of nanoscale diamonds into the domain of hyperpolarized MR.

abstract: First, the article considers the nature of quantum reality (the reality responsible for quantum phenomena) and the concept of realism (our ability to represent this reality) in quantum theory, in conjunction with the roles of locality, causality, and probability and statistics there. Second, it offers two interpretations of quantum mechanics, developed by the authors of this article, the second of which is also a different (from quantum mechanics) theory of quantum phenomena. Both of these interpretations are statistical. The first interpretation, by A. Plotnitsky, "the statistical Copenhagen interpretation," is non-realist, insofar as the description or even conception of the nature of quantum objects and processes is precluded. The second, by A. Khrennikov, is ultimately realist, because it assumes that the quantum-mechanical level of reality is underlain by a deeper level of reality, described, in a realist fashion, by a model based on the pre-quantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT), the predictions of which reproduce theory of quantum mechanics. Moreover, because the continuous fields considered are transformed into discrete clicks of detectors, experimental outcomes in this model depend on the context of measurement in accordance with Bohr's interpretation and the statistical Copenhagen interpretation, which coincides with Bohr's interpretation in this regard.

abstract: We study the propagation and amplification of a microwave field in a four-level cascade quantum system which is realized in a superconducting phase quantum circuit. It is shown that by increasing the microwave pump tones feeding the system, the normal dispersion switches to the anomalous and the gain-assisted superluminal microwave propagation is obtained in this system. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the stimulated microwave field is generated via four-wave mixing without any inversion population in the energy levels of the system (amplification without inversion) and the group velocity of the generated pulse can be controlled by the external oscillating magnetic fluxes. We also show that in some special set of parameters, the absorption-free superluminal generated microwave propagation is obtained in superconducting phase quantum circuit system.

abstract: We study hole, electron and exciton transport in a charge transfer system in the presence of underdamped vibrational motion. We analyze the signature of these processes in the linear and third-, and fifth-order nonlinear electronic spectra. Calculations are performed with a numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion method for an underdamped Brownian oscillator spectral density. We find that combining electron, hole and exciton transfer can lead to non-trivial spectra with more structure than with excitonic coupling alone. Traces taken during the waiting time of a two-dimensional spectrum are dominated by vibrational motion and do not reflect the electron, hole, and exciton dynamics directly. We find that the fifth-order nonlinear response is particularly sensitive to the charge transfer process. While third-order 2D spectroscopy detects the correlation between two coherences, fifth-order 2D spectroscopy (2D population spectroscopy) is here designed to detect correlations between the excited states during two different time periods.

abstract: We study nonperturbative multiphoton electron-positron pair creation in ultra-strong electromagnetic fields formed by two counterpropagating pulses with elliptic polarization. Our numerical approach allows us to take into account the temporal as well as the spatial variation of the standing electromagnetic field. The spin and momentum resolved pair creation probabilities feature characteristic Rabi oscillations and resonance spectra. Therefore, each laser frequency features a specific momentum distribution of the created particles. We find that depending on the relative polarization of both pulses the created electrons may be spin polarized along the direction of field propagation.

abstract: We present a transparent way of deriving a systematic high-frequency expansion for the effective Hamiltonian and the micromotion operator of periodically driven quantum systems. It is based on the block diagonalization of the quasienergy operator in the extended Floquet Hilbert space by means of degenerate perturbation theory. For this purpose, we generalize the formalism of degenerate perturbation theory to the block diagonalization of hermitian operators into more than two subspaces. Our results are found to be equivalent to those obtained within a different approach in references [Phys. Rev. A 68, 013820 (2003)] and [Phys. Rev. X 4, 031027 (2014)]. We relate the high-frequency expansion to the Floquet-Magnus expansion [J. Phys. A 34, 2001 (2000)] and explain why the latter leads to an artifactual dependence of the quasienergy spectrum on the driving phase. Finally, we illustrate the method using the example of a periodically driven tight-binding lattice and discuss its limitations for systems of many interacting particles.

abstract: The rapid development of technology has provided a wealth of resources enabling the trust of everyday interactions to be undermined. Authentication schemes aim to address this challenge by providing proof of identity. This can be achieved by using devices that, when challenged, give unique but reproducible responses. At present, these distinct signatures are commonly generated by physically unclonable functions, or PUFs. These devices provide a straightforward measurement of a physical characteristic of their structure that has inherent randomness, due to imperfections in the manufacturing process. These hard-to-predict physical responses can generate a unique identity that can be used for authentication without relying on the secrecy of stored data. However, the classical design of these devices limits both their size and security. Here we show that the extensively studied problematic fluctuations in the current-voltage measurements of resonant tunnelling diodes (RTDs) provide an uncomplicated, robust measurement that can function as a PUF without conventional resource limitations. This is possible due to quantum tunnelling within the RTD, and on account of these room temperature quantum effects, we term such devices QUFs - quantum unclonable functions. As a result of the current-voltage spectra being dependent on the atomic structure and composition of the nanostructure within the RTD, each device provides a high degree of uniqueness, whilst being impossible to clone or simulate, even with state-of-the-art technology. We have thus created PUF-like devices requiring the fewest resources which make use of quantum phenomena in a highly manufacturable electronic device operating at room temperature. Conventional spectral analysis techniques, when applied to our QUFs, will enable reliable generation of unpredictable unique identities which can be employed in advanced authentication systems.

abstract: Niels Bohr's doctrine of the primacy of "classical concepts" is arguably his most criticized and misunderstood view. We present a new, careful historical analysis that makes clear that Bohr's doctrine was primarily an epistemological thesis, derived from his understanding of the functional role of experiment. A hitherto largely overlooked disagreement between Bohr and Heisenberg about the movability of the "cut" between measuring apparatus and observed quantum system supports the view that, for Bohr, such a cut did not originate in dynamical (ontological) considerations, but rather in functional (epistemological) considerations. As such, both the motivation and the target of Bohr's doctrine of classical concepts are of a fundamentally different nature than what is understood as the dynamical problem of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our analysis suggests that, contrary to claims often found in the literature, Bohr's doctrine is not, and cannot be, at odds with proposed solutions to the dynamical problem of the quantum-classical transition that were pursued by several of Bohr's followers and culminated in the development of decoherence theory.

abstract: Signal processing techniques have been developed that use different strategies to bypass the Nyquist sampling theorem in order to recover more information than a traditional discrete Fourier transform. Here we examine three such methods: filter diagonalization, compressed sensing, and super-resolution. We apply them to a broad range of signal forms commonly found in science and engineering in order to discover when and how each method can be used most profitably. We find that filter diagonalization provides the best results for Lorentzian signals, while compressed sensing and super-resolution perform better for arbitrary signals.

abstract: A simple algorithm, which exploits the associativity of the BCH formula, and that can be generalized by iteration, extends the remarkable simplification of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula, recently derived by Van-Brunt and Visser. We show that if $[X,Y]=uX+vY+cI$, $[Y,Z]=wY+zZ+dI$, and, consistently with the Jacobi identity, $[X,Z]=mX+nY+pZ+eI$, then $$ \exp(X)\exp(Y)\exp(Z)=\exp({aX+bY+cZ+dI}) $$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are solutions of four equations. In particular, the Van-Brunt and Visser formula $$\exp(X)\exp(Z)=\exp({aX+bZ+c[X,Z]+dI}) $$ extends to cases when $[X,Z]$ contains also elements different from $X$ and $Z$. Such a closed form of the BCH formula may have interesting applications both in mathematics and physics. As an application, we provide the closed form of the BCH formula in the case of the exponentiation of the Virasoro algebra, with ${\rm SL}_2({\rm C})$ following as a subcase. We also determine three-dimensional subalgebras of the Virasoro algebra satisfying the Van-Brunt and Visser condition. It turns out that the exponential form of ${\rm SL}_2({\rm C})$ has a nice representation in terms of its eigenvalues and of the fixed points of the corresponding M\"obius transformation. This may have applications in Uniformization theory and Conformal Field Theories.

We describe gauge invariant relational observables that probe the black hole interior in these states and constrain their properties using effective field theory. By adapting recent versions of the information paradox we show that these observables are necessarily described by state-dependent bulk-boundary maps, which we construct explicitly.

abstract: We consider metamolecule consisting of bosonic mode correlated with the two-level system: it can be, for example, plasmonic mode interacting with the quantum dot or molecule in the resonator. We focus on the parameter range where all the correlations are strong and of the same order: interaction between bosonic mode correlated with the two-level system, external coherent drive and dissipation. Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations show a fluorescence of this system at dissipation larger than the driving amplitude and strong (by the order of magnitude) narrowing of its spectral line. This effect may be related to kind of a quantum stochastic resonance. We show that the fluorescence corresponds to finite domain over the coherent drive with sharp lower threshold and there is splitting of the Wigner function.

abstract: We use the stationary phase method to determine the path of optical beams which propagate through a dielectric block. In the presence of partial internal reflection, we recover the geometrical result obtained by using the Snell law. For total internal reflection, the stationary phase method overreaches the Snell law predicting the Goos-Haenchen shift.

abstract: We study the non-equilibrium properties of a quantum spin array coupled to a ohmic bosonic bath. The bath induces entanglement between spins as well as dissipation. For two spins, the environment can engender a dissipative quantum phase transition of Kosterlitz-Thouless type. We develop a stochastic approach allowing to describe quantum quenches and interferometry in an exact manner in this situation. In the case of a quantum Ising chain in a transverse field, we assume long-range interactions between spins. This allows a tractable stochastic non-equilibrium mean-field theory for quantum jumps in spin arrays. We address the interplay between Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg-Majorana interferometry, many-body quenches, dissipative quantum phase transitions, and bath-engineering. We build a Kibble-Zurek type argument to account for non-equilibrium and interaction effects in the lattice. Such dissipative quantum spin arrays can be realized in ultra-cold atom, trapped ion and mesoscopic systems and are also connected to Kondo lattice systems.

abstract: Why life persists at the edge of chaos is a question at the very heart of evolution. Here we show that molecules taking part in biochemical processes from small molecules to proteins are critical quantum mechanically. Electronic Hamiltonians of biomolecules are tuned exactly to the critical point of the metal-insulator transition separating the Anderson localized insulator phase from the conducting disordered metal phase. Using tools from Random Matrix Theory we confirm that the energy level statistics of these biomolecules show the universal transitional distribution of the metal-insulator critical point and the wave functions are multifractals in accordance with the theory of Anderson transitions. The findings point to the existence of a universal mechanism of charge transport in living matter. The revealed bio-conductor material is neither a metal nor an insulator but a new quantum critical material which can exist only in highly evolved systems and has unique material properties.

abstract: The impact of interparticle correlations on the behavior of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) is discussed using two approaches. In the first approach, the wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the $N$-particle sector of an extended "catalytic state". Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can organize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$. Requiring the terms of order ${N}^{1/2}$ to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation. Going to the next order, $N^0$, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation. Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture and to apply many techniques from quantum optics. Moreover, it is easier to track different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the multi-component case. In the second approach, I consider a state of $N =l\times n$ bosons that is derived by symmetrizing the $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $l$-boson state. Particularly, we are interested in the pure state case for $l=2$, which we call the Pair-Correlated State (PCS). I show that PCS reproduces the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation; moreover, it also works in the strong interaction regime where the Bogoliubov approximation fails. For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error (measured by the trace distance of the two-particle reduced density matrices) of PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making PCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases. Amazingly, the error of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system evolves for longer times. I derive both time-dependent and -independent equations for the ground state and the time evolution of the PCS ansatz. The time complexity of simulating PCS does not depend on $N$ and is linear in the number of orbitals in use.

abstract: The fidelity susceptibility is a general purpose probe of phase transitions. With its origin in quantum information and in the differential geometry perspective of quantum states, the fidelity susceptibility can indicate the presence of a phase transition without prior knowledge of the local order parameter, as well as reveal the universal properties of a critical point. The wide applicability of the fidelity susceptibility to quantum many-body systems is, however, hindered by the limited computational tools to evaluate it. We present a generic, efficient, and elegant approach to compute the fidelity susceptibility of correlated fermions, bosons, and quantum spin systems in a broad range of quantum Monte Carlo methods. It can be applied both to the ground-state and non-zero temperature cases. The Monte Carlo estimator has a simple yet universal form, which can be efficiently evaluated in simulations. We demonstrate the power of this approach with applications to the Bose-Hubbard model, the spin-$1/2$ XXZ model, and use it to examine the hypothetical intermediate spin-liquid phase in the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice.

abstract: We study the potential energy surface of the ozone molecule by means of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the resonating valence bond concept. The trial wave function consists of an antisymmetrized geminal power arranged in a single-determinant that is multiplied by a Jastrow correlation factor. Whereas the determinantal part incorporates static correlation effects, the augmented real-space correlation factor accounts for the dynamics electron correlation. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by computing the potential energy surface for the ozone molecule in three vibrational states: symmetric, asymmetric and scissoring. We find that the employed wave function provides a detailed description of rather strongly-correlated multi-reference systems, which is in quantitative agreement with experiment.

abstract: In the context of a charge qubit under continuous monitoring by a single electron transistor, we propose an unraveling of the generalized quantum Markovian master equation into an ensemble of individual quantum trajectories for stochastic point process. A suboptimal feedback algorism is implemented into individual quantum trajectories to protect a desired pure state. Coherent oscillations of the charge qubit could be maintained in principle for an arbitrarily long time in case of sufficient feedback strength. The effectiveness of the feedback control is also reflected in the detector's noise spectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio rises significantly with increasing feedback strength such that it could even exceed the Korotkov-Averin bound in quantum measurement, manifesting almost ideal quantum coherent oscillations of the qubit. The proposed unraveling and feedback protocol may open up the prospect to sustain ideal coherent oscillations of a charge qubit in quantum computation algorithms.

abstract: Interatomic coulombic decay (ICD) is a relaxation process induced by electronic correlation. In this work we study the ICD process in a two coupled Quantum wells (QWs) nano-structure. We study a simple one-dimensional effective potential using experimental parameters of the semiconductor QW layers i.e. using the single band effective-mass approximation . In our calculations we consider the discontinuity of the effective mass of the electron in each of the QW layers. We control the ICD lifetime by changing the distance between the two wells. The expected overall trend is a decrease of ICD lifetime with a decrease in the distance between the wells. We show that the distance can be tuned such that the emitted ICD electron is trapped in a meta-stable state in the continuum i.e. a one electron resonance state. This causes the life time of the ICD to be an order of magnitude smaller even in very long distances, and improves the efficiency of the ICD. For the ICD to be dominant decay mechanism it must prevail over all other possible competitive decay processes. We have found that the lifetime of the ICD is on the timescale of picoseconds. Therefore, based on our results we can design an experiment that will observe the ICD phenomenon in QWs nano-structure for the first time. This work can lead to designing a wavelength sensitive detector which is efficient even in low intensities.

abstract: We present first results from a number of experiments conducted on a 0.53 kg cylindrical dumbbell-shaped sapphire crystal. This is the first reported optomechanical experiment of this nature utilising a novel modification to the typical cylindrical architecture. Mechanical motion of the crystal structure alters the dimensions of the crystal, and the induced strain changes the permittivity. These two effects result in parametric frequency modulation of resonant microwave whispering gallery modes that are simultaneously excited within the crystal. A novel low-noise microwave readout system is implemented allowing extremely low noise measurements of this frequency modulation near our modes of interest, having a phase noise floor of -165 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz. Fine-tuning of the crystal's suspension has allowed for the optimisation of mechanical quality factors in preparation for cryogenic experiments, with a value of Q=8 x 10^7 achieved at 127 kHz. This results in a Q x f product of 10^13, equivalent to the best measured values in a macroscopic sapphire mechanical system. Results are presented that demonstrate the excitation of mechanical modes via radiation pressure force, allowing an experimental method of determining the transducer's displacement sensitivity df/dx, and calibrating the system. Finally, we demonstrate parametric back-action phenomenon within the system. These are all important steps towards the overall goal of the experiment; to cool a macroscopic device to the quantum ground state at millikelvin temperatures.

abstract: Radiative decay processes at cold and ultra cold temperatures for Sulfur atoms colliding with protons are investigated. The MOLPRO quantum chemistry suite of codes was used to obtain accurate potential energies and transition dipole moments, as a function of internuclear distance, between low-lying states of the SH$^{+}$ molecular cation. A multi-reference configuration-interaction (MRCI) approximation together with the Davidson correction is used to determine the potential energy curves and transition dipole moments, between the states of interest, where the molecular orbitals (MO's) are obtained from state-averaged multi configuration-self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations. The collision problem is solved approximately using an optical potential method to obtain radiative loss, and a fully two-channel quantum approach for radiative charge transfer. Cross sections and rate coefficients are determined for the first time for temperatures ranging from 10 $\mu$ K up to 10,000 K. Results are obtained for all isotopes of Sulfur, colliding with H$^{+}$ and D$^{+}$ ions and comparison is made to a number of other collision systems.

abstract: We investigate the propagation of electron vortex beams in a magnetic field. It is pointed out that when electron vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate in a magnetic field, the Berry curvature associated with the scalar electron moving in a cyclic path around the vortex line is modified from that in free space. This alters the spin-orbit interaction, which affects the propagation of nonparaxial beams. The electron vortex beams with tilted vortex lead to spin Hall effect in free space. In presence of a magnetic field in time space we have spin filtering such that either positive or negative spin states emerge in spin Hall currents with clustering of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ states.

abstract: Biological samples continuously emit ultra-weak photon emission (UPE, or "biophotons") which stems from electronic excited states generated chemically during oxidative metabolism and stress. Thus, UPE can potentially serve as a method for non-invasive diagnostics of oxidative processes or, if discovered, also of other processes capable of electron excitation. While the fundamental generating mechanisms of UPE are fairly elucidated together with their approximate ranges of intensities and spectra, statistical properties of UPE is still a highly challenging topic. Here we review claims about nontrivial statistical properties of UPE, such as coherence and squeezed states of light. After introduction to the necessary theory, we categorize the experimental works of all authors to those with solid, conventional interpretation and those with unconventional and even speculative interpretation. The conclusion of our review is twofold; while the phenomenon of UPE from biological systems can be considered experimentally well established, no reliable evidence for the coherence or nonclassicality of UPE was actually achieved up to now. Furthermore, we propose perspective avenues in the research of statistical properties of biological UPE.

abstract: Energy dissipation and decoherence are at first glance harmful to acquiring long exciton lifetime desired for efficient photovoltaics. In the presence of both optically forbidden (namely, dark) and allowed (bright) excitons, however, they can be instrumental as suggested in photosynthesis. By simulating quantum dynamics of exciton relaxations, we show that the optimized decoherence that imposes a quantum-to-classical crossover with the dissipation realizes a dramatically longer lifetime. In an example of carbon nanotube, the exciton lifetime increases by nearly two orders of magnitude when the crossover triggers stable high population in the dark exciton.

abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates made of ultracold trapped bosonic atoms have become a central venue in which interacting many-body quantum systems are studied. The ground state of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate has been proven to be 100% condensed in the limit of infinite particle number and constant interaction parameter [Lieb and Seiringer, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 88}, 170409 (2002)]. The meaning of this result is that properties of the condensate, noticeably its energy and density, converge to those obtained by minimizing the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional. This naturally raises the question whether correlations are of any importance in this limit. Here, we demonstrate both analytically and numerically that even in the infinite particle limit many-body correlations can lead to a substantial modification of the \textit{variance} of any operator compared to that expected from the Gross-Pitaevskii result. The strong deviation of the variance stems from its explicit dependence on terms of the reduced two-body density matrix which otherwise do not contribute to the energy and density in this limit. This makes the variance a sensitive probe of many-body correlations even when the energy and density of the system have already converged to the Gross-Pitaevskii result. We use the center-of-mass position operator to exemplify this persistence of correlations. Implications of this many-body effect are discussed.

abstract: The protocols for the control and readout of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centres electron spins in diamond offer an advanced platform for quantum computation, metrology and sensing. These protocols are based on the optical readout of photons emitted from NV centres, which process is limited by the yield of photons collection. Here we report on a novel principle for the detection of NV centres magnetic resonance in diamond by directly monitoring spin-preserving electron transitions through measurement of NV centre related photocurrent. The demonstrated direct detection technique offers a sensitive way for the readout of diamond NV sensors and diamond quantum devices on diamond chips. The Photocurrent Detection of Magnetic Resonance (PDMR) scheme is based on the detection of charge carriers promoted to the conduction band of diamond by the two-photon ionization of NV- centres. Optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR) and PDMR are compared, by performing both measurements simultaneously. The minima detected in the measured photocurrent at resonant microwave frequencies are attributed to the spin-dependent occupation probability of the NV- ground state, originating from spin-selective non-radiative transitions.

We explore all the possible signs of the potentials and discuss their bound-state solutions for fermions and antifermions. We show the relation between spin and pseudospin symmetries by means of charge-conjugation and $\gamma^{5}$ chiral transformations. The cases of pure pseudoscalar and mixed vector-scalar potentials, already analyzed in previous works, are obtained as particular cases. The results presented can be extended to 3+1 dimensions.

The 99 +/- 1% degree of polarization at room temperature corresponds to an effective nuclear temperature of 5 microKelvin. By combining ab initio theory with the experimental identification of the color centers' optically excited states, we quantitatively model how the polarization derives from hyperfine-mediated level anticrossings. These results lay a foundation for SiC-based quantum memories, nuclear gyroscopes, and hyperpolarized probes for magnetic resonance imaging.

We review the recently obtained constraints on axion to nucleon coupling constants following from different experiments on measuring the Casimir interaction. These constraints are compared with those following from other laboratory experiments within the wide range of masses of axion-like particles from 10^{-10} to 20 eV. We also collect the most strong constraints on the Yukawa-type and power-type corrections to the Newton law of gravitation which follow from measurements of the Casimir interaction, Eotvos- and Cavendish-type experiments. The possibility to obtain stronger constraints on an axion from the Casimir effect is proposed.

abstract: An orthogonal basis of weight vectors for a class of infinite-dimensional representations of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(2m+1|2n) is introduced. These representations are particular lowest weight representations V(p), with a lowest weight of the form [-p/2,...,-p/2|p/2,...,p/2], p being a positive integer. Explicit expressions for the transformation of the basis under the action of algebra generators are found. Since the relations of algebra generators correspond to the defining relations of m pairs of parafermion operators and n pairs of paraboson operators with relative parafermion relations, the parastatistics Fock space of order p is also explicitly constructed. Furthermore, the representations V(p) are shown to have interesting characters in terms of supersymmetric Schur functions, and a simple character formula is also obtained.

abstract: A central goal in quantum information science is to efficiently interface photons with single optical modes for quantum networking and distributed quantum computing. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact and efficient method for the low-loss coupling of a solid-state qubit, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, with a single-mode optical fibre. In this approach, single-mode tapered diamond waveguides containing exactly one high quality NV memory are selected and integrated on tapered silica fibres. Numerical optimization of an adiabatic coupler indicates that near-unity-efficiency photon transfer is possible between the two modes. Experimentally, we find an overall collection efficiency between 18-40 % and observe a raw single photon count rate above 700 kHz. This integrated system enables robust, alignment-free, and efficient interfacing of single-mode optical fibres with single photon emitters and quantum memories in solids.

abstract: Quantum physics predicts that there is a fundamental maximum heat conductance across a single transport channel, and that this thermal conductance quantum $G_Q$ is universal, independent of the type of particles carrying the heat. Such universality, combined with the relationship between heat and information, signals a general limit on information transfer. We report on the quantitative measurement of the quantum limited heat flow for Fermi particles across a single electronic channel, using noise thermometry. The demonstrated agreement with the predicted $G_Q$ establishes experimentally this basic building block of quantum thermal transport. The achieved accuracy of below 10\% opens access to many experiments involving the quantum manipulation of heat.

abstract: We develop a quantum mechanical formalism to treat the strong coupling between an electromagnetic mode and a vibrational excitation of an ensemble of organic molecules. By employing a Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness approach, we show that the influence of dephasing-type interactions, i.e., elastic collisions with a background bath of phonons, critically depends on the nature of the bath modes. In particular, for long-range phonons corresponding to a common bath, the dynamics of the "bright state" (the collective superposition of molecular vibrations coupling to the cavity mode) is effectively decoupled from other system eigenstates. For the case of independent baths (or short-range phonons), incoherent energy transfer occurs between the bright state and the uncoupled dark states. However, these processes are suppressed when the Rabi splitting is larger than the frequency range of the bath modes, as achieved in a recent experiment [Shalabney et al., Nat. Commun. 6, 5981 (2015)]. In both cases, the dynamics can thus be described through a single collective oscillator coupled to a photonic mode, making this system an ideal candidate to explore cavity optomechanics at room temperature.
