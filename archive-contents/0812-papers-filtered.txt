abstract: Quantum computers can execute algorithms that dramatically outperform classical computation. As the best-known example, Shor discovered an efficient quantum algorithm for factoring integers, whereas factoring appears to be difficult for classical computers. Understanding what other computational problems can be solved significantly faster using quantum algorithms is one of the major challenges in the theory of quantum computation, and such algorithms motivate the formidable task of building a large-scale quantum computer. This article reviews the current state of quantum algorithms, focusing on algorithms with superpolynomial speedup over classical computation, and in particular, on problems with an algebraic flavor.

abstract: We consider coherent exciton transport modeled by continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on long-range interacting cycles (LRICs), which are constructed by connecting all the two nodes of distance $m$ in the cycle graph. LRIC has a symmetric structure and can be regarded as the extensions of the cycle graph (nearest-neighboring lattice). For small values of $m$, the classical and quantum return probabilities show power law behavior $p(t)\sim t^{-0.5}$ and $\pi(t)\sim t^{-1}$, respectively. However, for large values of $m$, the classical and quantum efficiency scales as $p(t)\sim t^{-1}$ and $\pi(t)\sim t^{-2}$. We give a theoretical explanation of this transition using the method of stationary phase approximation (SPA). In the long time limit, depending on the network size $N$ and parameter $m$, the limiting probability distributions of quantum transport show various patterns. When the network size $N$ is an even number, we find an asymmetric transition probability of quantum transport between the initial node and its opposite node. This asymmetry depends on the precise values of $N$ and $m$. Finally, we study the transport processes in the presence of traps and find that the survival probability decays faster on networks of large $m$.
