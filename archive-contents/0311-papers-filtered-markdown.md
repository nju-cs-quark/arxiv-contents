**1.    Quantum walk algorithm for element distinctness**  
Andris Ambainis  
SIAM Journal on Computing, 37(1):210-239, 2007  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311001  
<blockquote>
<p>
We use quantum walks to construct a new quantum algorithm for element distinctness and its generalization. For element distinctness (the problem of finding two equal items among N given items), we get an O(N^{2/3}) query quantum algorithm. This improves the previous O(N^{3/4}) query quantum algorithm of Buhrman et.al. (quant-ph/0007016) and matches the lower bound by Shi (quant-ph/0112086). The algorithm also solves the generalization of element distinctness in which we have to find k equal items among N items. For this problem, we get an O(N^{k/(k+1)}) query quantum algorithm.

**2.    Quantum random walks with history dependence**  
Adrian P. Flitney, Derek Abbott, Neil F. Johnson  
J. Phys. A 37 (2004) 7581-7591  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311009  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce a multi-coin discrete quantum random walk where the amplitude for a coin flip depends upon previous tosses. Although the corresponding classical random walk is unbiased, a bias can be introduced into the quantum walk by varying the history dependence. By mixing the biased random walk with an unbiased one, the direction of the bias can be reversed leading to a new quantum version of Parrondo's paradox.

**3.    Quantum algorithms for subset finding**  
Andrew M. Childs, Jason M. Eisenberg  
Quantum Information and Computation 5, 593 (2005)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311038  
<blockquote>
<p>
Recently, Ambainis gave an O(N^(2/3))-query quantum walk algorithm for element distinctness, and more generally, an O(N^(L/(L+1)))-query algorithm for finding L equal numbers. We point out that this algorithm actually solves a much more general problem, the problem of finding a subset of size L that satisfies any given property. We review the algorithm and give a considerably simplified analysis of its query complexity. We present several applications, including two algorithms for the problem of finding an L-clique in an N-vertex graph. One of these algorithms uses O(N^(2L/(L+1))) edge queries, and the other uses \tilde{O}(N^((5L-2)/(2L+4))), which is an improvement for L <= 5. The latter algorithm generalizes a recent result of Magniez, Santha, and Szegedy, who considered the case L=3 (finding a triangle). We also pose two open problems regarding continuous time quantum walk and lower bounds.

**4.    Multilinear Formulas and Skepticism of Quantum Computing**  
Scott Aaronson  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311039  
<blockquote>
<p>
Several researchers, including Leonid Levin, Gerard 't Hooft, and Stephen Wolfram, have argued that quantum mechanics will break down before the factoring of large numbers becomes possible. If this is true, then there should be a natural set of quantum states that can account for all experiments performed to date, but not for Shor's factoring algorithm. We investigate as a candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and tensor products. Using a recent lower bound on multilinear formula size due to Raz, we then show that states arising in quantum error-correction require n^{Omega(log n)} additions and tensor products even to approximate, which incidentally yields the first superpolynomial gap between general and multilinear formula size of functions. More broadly, we introduce a complexity classification of pure quantum states, and prove many basic facts about this classification. Our goal is to refine vague ideas about a breakdown of quantum mechanics into specific hypotheses that might be experimentally testable in the near future.

**5.    Localization of Two-Dimensional Quantum Walks**  
Norio Inui, Yoshinao Konishi, Norio Konno  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311118  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Grover walk, which is related to the Grover's search algorithm on a quantum computer, is one of the typical discrete time quantum walks. However, a localization of the two-dimensional Grover walk starting from a fixed point is striking different from other types of quantum walks. The present paper explains the reason why the walker who moves according to the degree-four Grover's operator can remain at the starting point with a high probability. It is shown that the key factor for the localization is due to the degeneration of eigenvalues of the time evolution operator. In fact, the global time evolution of the quantum walk on a large lattice is mainly determined by the degree of degeneration. The dependence of the localization on the initial state is also considered by calculating the wave function analytically.
