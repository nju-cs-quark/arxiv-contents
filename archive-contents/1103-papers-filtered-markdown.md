Norio Konno, Iwao Sato  
Quantum Information Processing, Vol.11, No.2, pp.341-349 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0079  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present an explicit formula for the characteristic polynomial of the transition matrix of the discrete-time quantum walk on a graph via the second weighted zeta function. As applications, we obtain new proofs for the results on spectra of the transition matrix and its positive support.

**2.    Quantum Walk with a four-dimensional coin**  
Craig S Hamilton, Aurel Gabris, Igor Jex, Stephen M Barnett  
New Journal of Physics, Vol 13, 013015, 2011  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0126  
<blockquote>
<p>
We examine the physical implementation of a discrete time quantum walk with a four-dimensional coin. Our quantum walker is a photon moving repeatedly through a time delay loop, with time being our position space. The quantum coin is implemented using the internal states of the photon: the polarization and two of the orbital angular momentum states. We demonstrate how to implement this physically and what components would be needed. We then illustrate some of the results that could be obtained by performing the experiment.

**3.    High-capacity quantum secure direct communication based on quantum hyperdense coding with hyperentanglement**  
Tie-Jun Wang, Tao Li, Fang-Fang Du, Fu-Guo Deng  
Chinese Physics Letters 28, 040305 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0471  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a quantum hyperdense coding protocol with hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom of photons first and then give the details for a quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocol based on this quantum hyperdense coding protocol. This QSDC protocol has the advantage of having a higher capacity than the quantum communication protocols with a qubit system. Compared with the QSDC protocol based on superdense coding with $d$-dimensional systems, this QSDC protocol is more feasible as the preparation of a high-dimension quantum system is more difficult than that of a two-level quantum system at present.

**4.    Two-photon quantum walks in an elliptical direct-write waveguide array**  
J. O. Owens, M. A. Broome, D. N. Biggerstaff, M. E. Goggin, A. Fedrizzi, T. Linjordet, M. Ams, G. D. Marshall, J. Twamley, M. J. Withford, A. G. White  
New J. Phys. 13 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0604  
<blockquote>
<p>
Integrated optics provides an ideal test bed for the emulation of quantum systems via continuous-time quantum walks. Here we study the evolution of two-photon states in an elliptic array of waveguides. We characterise the photonic chip via coherent-light tomography and use the results to predict distinct differences between temporally indistinguishable and distinguishable two-photon inputs which we then compare with experimental observations. Our work highlights the feasibility for emulation of coherent quantum phenomena in three-dimensional waveguide structures.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1180  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze final-time dependent discrete-time quantum walks in one dimension. We compute asymptotics of the return probability of the quantum walk by a path counting approach. Moreover, we discuss a relation between the quantum walk and the corresponding final-time dependent classical random walk.

**8.    Classical Simulation of Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms using Mathematica on GPUs**  
Sandra D��az-Pier, Salvador E. Venegas-Andraca, Jos�� Luis G��mez-Mu?oz  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1399  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this paper we present a simulation environment enhanced with parallel processing which can be used on personal computers, based on a high-level user interface developed on Mathematica\copyright which is connected to C++ code in order to make our platform capable of communicating with a Graphics Processing Unit. We introduce the reader to the behavior of our proposal by simulating a quantum adiabatic algorithm designed for solving hard instances of the 3-SAT problem. We show that our simulator is capable of significantly increasing the number of qubits that can be simulated using classical hardware. Finally, we present a review of currently available classical simulators of quantum systems together with some justifications, based on our willingness to further understand processing properties of Nature, for devoting resources to building more powerful simulators.

**9.    Two-state quantum walk on two- and three-dimensional lattices**  
C. M. Chandrashekar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2704  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new scheme for a discrete-time quantum walk on two- and three-dimensional lattices using a two-state particle. We use different Pauli basis as translational eigestates for different axis and show that the coin operation, which is necessary for one-dimensional walk is not a necessary requirement for two- and three- dimensional walk but can serve as an additional resource. Using this scheme, the probability distribution from Grover walk using four-state particle and other equivalent schemes on a square lattice using coin operation is reproduced. We also present the Hamiltonian form of evolution which can serve as a general framework to simulate, control, and study the dynamics in different physical systems.

**10.    Limit Theorems For Quantum Walks Associated with Hadamard Matrices**  
Clement Ampadu  
Physical Review A, Volume 84, Number 1,012324 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3899  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a one-parameter family of discrete-time quantum walk models on the line and in the xy-plane associated with the Hadamard walk. Weak convergence in the long-time limit of all moments of the walker's pseudo-velocity on the line and in the xy-plane is proved. Symmetrization on the line and in the xy-plane is theoretically investigated, leading to the resolution of the Konno-Namiki-Soshi conjecture in the special case of symmetrization of the unbiased Hadamard walk on the line . A necessary condition for the existence of a phenomenon known as localization is given.

**11.    Discrete Time Quantum Walk Approach to State Transfer**  
Pawel Kurzynski, Antoni Wojcik  
Phys. Rev. A 83, 062315 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4185  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that a quantum state transfer, previously studied as a continuous time process in networks of interacting spins, can be achieved within the model of discrete time quantum walks with position dependent coin. We argue that due to additional degrees of freedom, discrete time quantum walks allow to observe e?ects which cannot be observed in the corresponding continuous time case. First, we study a discrete time version of the engineered coupling protocol due to Christandl et. al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 187902 (2004)] and then discuss the general idea of conversion between continuous time quantum walks and discrete time quantum walks.

**12.    Topological phases and delocalization of quantum walks in random environments**  
Hideaki Obuse, Norio Kawakami  
Phys. Rev. B 84, 195139 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5545  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate one-dimensional (1D) discrete time quantum walks (QWs) with spatially or temporally random defects as a consequence of interactions with random environments. We focus on the QWs with chiral symmetry in a topological phase, and reveal that chiral symmetry together with bipartite nature of the QWs brings about intriguing behaviors such as coexistence of topologically protected edge states at zero energy and Anderson transitions in the 1D chiral class at non-zero energy in their dynamics. Contrary to the previous studies, therefore, the spatially disordered QWs can avoid complete localization due to the Anderson transition. It is further confirmed that the edge states are robust for spatial disorder but not for temporal disorder.

**13.    Cellular Algebras and Graph Invariants Based on Quantum Walks**  
Jamie Smith  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0262  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider two graph invariants inspired by quantum walks- one in continuous time and one in discrete time. We will associate a matrix algebra called a cellular algebra with every graph. We show that, if the cellular algebras of two graphs have a similar structure, then they are not distinguished by either of the proposed invariants.

**14.    A ring of BEC pools as a trap for persistent flow**  
Jacek Dziarmaga, Marek Tylutki, Wojciech H. Zurek  
Phys. Rev. B 84, 094528 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0669  
<blockquote>
<p>
Mott insulator - superfluid transition in a periodic lattice of Josephson junctions can be driven by tunneling rate increase. Resulting winding numbers $W$ of the condensate wavefunction decrease with increasing quench time in accord with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, in very slow quenches Bose-Hubbard dynamics rearranges wavefunction phase so that its random walk cools, $\bar{W^2}$ decreases and eventually the wavefunction becomes too cold to overcome potential barriers separating different $W$. Thus, in contrast with KZM, in very slow quenches $\bar{W^2}$ is set by random walk with "critical" step size, independently of $\tau_Q$.

**15.    Levinson's theorem for graphs**  
Andrew M. Childs, DJ Strouse  
Journal of Mathematical Physics 52, 082102 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5077  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove an analog of Levinson's theorem for scattering on a weighted (m+1)-vertex graph with a semi-infinite path attached to one of its vertices. In particular, we show that the number of bound states in such a scattering problem is equal to m minus half the winding number of the phase of the reflection coefficient (where each so-called half-bound state is counted as half a bound state).

**16.    Average mixing of continuous quantum walks**  
Chris Godsil  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2578  
<blockquote>
<p>
If $X$ is a graph with adjacency matrix $A$, then we define $H(t)$ to be the operator $\exp(itA)$. The Schur (or entrywise) product $H(t)\circ H(-t)$ is a doubly stochastic matrix and, because of work related to quantum computing, we are concerned the \textsl{average mixing matrix}. This can be defined as the limit of $C^{-1} \int_0^C H(t)\circ H(-t)\dt$ as $C\to\infty$. We establish some of the basic properties of this matrix, showing that it is positive semidefinite and that its entries are always rational. We find that for paths and cycles this matrix takes on a surprisingly simple form, thus for the path it is a linear combination of $I$, $J$ (the all-ones matrix), and a permutation matrix.
