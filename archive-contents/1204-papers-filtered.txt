abstract: We perform a systematic study of the discrete time Quantum Walk on one dimension using Wigner functions, which are generalized to include the chirality (or coin) degree of freedom. In particular, we analyze the evolution of the negative volume in phase space, as a function of time, for different initial states. This negativity can be used to quantify the degree of departure of the system from a classical state. We also relate this quantity to the entanglement between the coin and walker subspaces.

abstract: We study the decoherence effects originating from state flipping and depolarization for two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks using four-state and two-state particles. By quantifying the quantum correlations between the particle and position degree of freedom and between the two spatial ($x-y$) degrees of freedom using measurement induced disturbance (MID), we show that the two schemes using a two-state particle are more robust against decoherence than the Grover walk, which uses a four-state particle. We also show that the symmetries which hold for two-state quantum walks breakdown for the Grover walk, adding to the various other advantages of using two-state particles over four-state particles.

abstract: Quantum spin networks can be used to transport information between separated registers in a quantum information processor. To find a practical implementation, the strict requirements of ideal models for perfect state transfer need to be relaxed, allowing for complex coupling topologies and general initial states. Here we analyze transport in complex quantum spin networks in the maximally mixed state and derive explicit conditions that should be satisfied by propagators for perfect state transport. Using a description of the transport process as a quantum walk over the network, we show that it is necessary to phase correlate the transport processes occurring along all the possible paths in the network. We provide a Hamiltonian that achieves this correlation, and use it in a constructive method to derive engineered couplings for perfect transport in complicated network topologies.

abstract: In the setting of networked computation, data security can be a significant concern. Here we consider the problem of allowing a server to remotely manipulate client supplied data, in such a way that both the information obtained by the client about the server's operation and the information obtained by the server about the client's data are significantly limited. We present a protocol for achieving such functionality in two closely related models of restricted quantum computation -- the Boson sampling and quantum walk models. Due to the limited technological requirements of the Boson scattering model, small scale implementations of this technique are feasible with present-day technology.

abstract: We analyze the effect of a classical noise into the entanglement dynamics between two particles, initially entangled, subject to continuous time quantum walks in a one-dimensional lattice. The noise is modeled by randomizing the transition amplitudes from one site to another. Both Markovian and non-Markovian environments are considered. For the Markov regime an exponential decay of the initial quantum correlation is found, while the loss of coherence of the quantum state increases monotonically with time up to a saturation value depending upon the degrees of freedom of the system. For the non-Markov regime the presence or absence of entanglement revival and entanglement sudden death phenomena is found or deduced depending on the peculiar characteristics of the noise. Our results indicate that the entanglement dynamics in the non-Markovian regime is affected by the persistence of the memory effects of the environment and by its intrinsic features.

abstract: Multi-dimensional quantum walks can exhibit highly non-trivial topological structure, providing a powerful tool for simulating quantum information and transport systems. We present a flexible implementation of a 2D optical quantum walk on a lattice, demonstrating a scalable quantum walk on a non-trivial graph structure. We realized a coherent quantum walk over 12 steps and 169 positions using an optical fiber network. With our broad spectrum of quantum coins we were able to simulate the creation of entanglement in bipartite systems with conditioned interactions. Introducing dynamic control allowed for the investigation of effects such as strong non-linearities or two-particle scattering. Our results illustrate the potential of quantum walks as a route for simulating and understanding complex quantum systems.

abstract: We systematically investigated perfect state transfer between antipodal nodes of discrete time quantum walks on variants of the cycles C_4, C_6 and C_8 for three choices of coin operator. Perfect state transfer was found, in general, to be very rare, only being preserved for a very small number of ways of modifying the cycles. We observed that some of our useful modifications of C_4 could be generalised to an arbitrary number of nodes, and present three families of graphs which admit quantum walks with interesting dynamics either in the continuous time walk, or in the discrete time walk for appropriate selections of coin and initial conditions. These dynamics are either periodicity, perfect state transfer, or very high fidelity state transfer. These families are modifications of families known not to exhibit periodicity or perfect state transfer in general. The robustness of the dynamics is tested by varying the initial state, interpolating between structures and by adding decoherence.

abstract: We present a novel scheme for universal quantum computation based on spinless interacting bosonic quantum walkers on a piecewise-constant graph, described by the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Arbitrary X and Z rotations are constructed, as well as an entangling two-qubit CPHASE gate and a SWAP gate. Quantum information is encoded in the positions of the walkers on the graph, as in previous quantum walk-based proposals for universal quantum computation, though in contrast to prior schemes this proposal requires a number of vertices only linear in the number of encoded qubits. It allows single-qubit measurements to be performed in a straightforward manner with localized operators, and can make use of existing quantum error correcting codes either directly within the universal gate set provided, or by extending the lattice to a third dimension. We present an intuitive example of a logical encoding to implement the seven-qubit Steane code. Finally, an implementation in terms of ultracold atoms in optical lattices is suggested.

abstract: Quantum walks obey unitary dynamics: they form closed quantum systems. The system becomes open if the walk suffers from imperfections represented as missing links on the underlying basic graph structure, described by dynamical percolation. Openness of the system's dynamics creates decoherence, leading to strong mixing. We present a method to analytically solve the asymptotic dynamics of coined, percolated quantum walks for a general graph structure. For the case of a circle and a linear graph we derive the explicit form of the asymptotic states. We find that a rich variety of asymptotic evolutions occur: not only the fully mixed state, but other stationary states; stable periodic and quasiperiodic oscillations can emerge, depending on the coin operator, the initial state, and the topology of the underlying graph.
