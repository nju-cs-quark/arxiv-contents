abstract: The problem of the electromagnetic self-force can be studied in terms of a quadratic PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Here, we apply a straightforward algebraic method to determine the regions of model-parameter space where the quantum-mechanical operator exhibits real spectrum. An alternative point of view consists of finding the values of the model parameters so that a symmetric operator supports bound states.

abstract: We analyze the effect of phase fluctuations in an optical communication scheme based on collective detection of sequences of binary coherent state symbols using linear optics and photon counting. When the phase noise is absent, the scheme offers qualitatively improved nonlinear scaling of the spectral efficiency with the mean photon number in the low-power regime compared to individual detection. We show that this feature, providing a demonstration of superaddivitity of accessible information in classical communication over quantum channels, is preserved if random phases imprinted on transmitted symbols fluctuate around a reference fixed over the sequence length.

abstract: We present the exact solution of the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for inverse square root potential $V=V_0/{\sqrt{x}}$. Each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the problem is given by a combination with non-constant coefficients of two confluent hypergeometric functions of a shifted argument. Alternatively, the solution is written through the first derivative of a tri-confluent Heun function. Apart from the standard quasi-polynomial eigensolutions providing the spectrum $E_n=E_1{n^{-2/3}}$, we discuss the case of bound-state wave functions vanishing both at infinity and in the origin. The exact spectrum equation for this case involves two Hermite functions of non-integer order which are not polynomials. An accurate approximation for the spectrum providing absolute error less than $10^{-3}$ is $E_n=E_1{(n-1/(2 \pi))^{-2/3}}$ . Each of the wave functions of bound states in general involves a combination with non-constant coefficients of two confluent hypergeometric and two non-integer order Hermite functions of a scaled and shifted coordinate.

abstract: Based on the mutually unbiased bases, the mutually unbiased measurements and the general symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures, we propose three separability criteria for $d$-dimensional bipartite quantum systems, which are more powerful than the corresponding ones introduced in [C. Spengler, M. Huber, S. Brierley, T. Adaktylos, and B.C. Hiesmayr, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{86}, 022311 (2012); B. Chen, T. Ma, and S.M. Fei, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{89}, 064302 (2014); B. Chen, T. Li, and S.M. Fei, arXiv:1406.7820v1 [quant-ph] (2014)]. Some states such as Werner states and Bell-diagonal states are used to further illustrate the efficiency of the presented criteria.

abstract: In this article we discuss the formal structure of a generalized information theory based on the extension of the probability calculus of Kolmogorov to a (possibly) non-commutative setting. By studying this framework, we argue that quantum information can be considered as a particular case of a huge family of non-commutative extensions of its classical counterpart. In any conceivable information theory, the possibility of dealing with different kinds of information measures plays a key role. Here, we generalize a notion of state spectrum, allowing us to introduce a majorization relation and a new family of generalized entropic measures.

abstract: We compare the standard 1/2-efficient single beam splitter method for Bell-state measurement to a proposed 3/4-efficient extension [W. P. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011)] in light of realistic experimental conditions. Our comparison is two-fold. First, we analyze the performance when one replaces number-resolving detectors with standard non-ideal ones either individually or in multiplexed arrays. Second, we analyze the performance of various detector types when the auxiliary source of perfect Bell pairs required for the enhanced scheme is replaced with a down-conversion source. On the detector side, we find that the enhanced scheme is superior to the standard scheme if fast number-resolving detectors with efficiencies greater than 82 % are used. If the number-resolving detectors are replaced with non-number-resolving detectors, then this can significantly decrease the success rate in the enhanced scheme whereas the standard scheme is less affected. Arrays of efficient detectors of various types with negligible dark count probabilities allow to increase success rates arbitrarily close to scheme maximum rates. However, with realistic efficiency and dark count probabilities noise becomes dominant with array size greater than approximately 20. On the auxiliary state side, we find that the enhanced scheme with ideal number-resolving detectors is still superior to the standard scheme when the auxiliary state is produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion.

abstract: We consider the Jaynes-Cummings model describing the interaction of a Cooper pair box (CPB) and a nanoresonator (NR) in the presence of a Kerr medium and losses The evolution of the entropy of both subsystems and the CPB population inversion were calculated numerically. It is found that these properties increase when the NR frequency is time-dependent, even in the presence of losses; the effect is very sensitive to detuning and disappears in the resonant regime. The roles played by the losses affecting the CPB and the NR are also compared.

abstract: By using transitionless quantum driving algorithm, we present an efficient shortcut to the holonomic quantum computation (HQC) in decoherence-free subspace (DFS). The adiabatic process can be speeded up in the shortest possible time. Besides the virtues of resilience of local fluctuations inherited from HQC and robustness against the collective noises with DFS, the present proposal requires only two-body interaction, and it is more feasible to be achieved in the specific physical system. In particular, we give a physical implementation for this shortcut on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamonds coupled to a whispering-gallery mode microsphere cavity in the dispersive regime. The shortcut scheme can be efficiently realized by controlling appropriately the frequencies of the external laser pulses as long as the initial conditions are prescribed. Moreover, these accelerated holonomic quantum gates, including two noncommuting single-qubit holonomic gates and a two-qubit holonomic controlled-phase gate, are insensitive to the cavity field states due to the virtual photon property. In addition, our scheme has potential extensions and generalizations to scale up the qubits.

abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI), based on the notions of realism and noninvasive measurability, is applied in the context of a linear harmonic oscillator. It is found that merely through observing at various instants which region of the potential well, the oscillating quantum object is in, the LGI can be violated without taking recourse to any ancillary quantum system. Strikingly, this violation reveals an unexplored nonclassicality of the state which is considered the most "classical-like" of all quantum states, namely the Schr\"odinger coherent state. In the macrolimit, the extent to which such nonclassicality persists for large values of mass and classical amplitudes of oscillation is quantitatively investigated. It is found that while for any given mass and oscillator frequency, a significant quantum violation of LGI can be obtained by suitably choosing the initial peak momentum of the coherent state wave packet, as the mass is sufficiently increased, actual observability of this violation becomes increasingly difficult. A feasible experimental setup for testing the predicted quantum mechanical violation of LGI is suggested using a trapped nano-object of $\sim 10^6-10^9$ amu mass.

The focus is on how symmetry, integrability, and solvability depend on the trap shape, two-body interaction, the number of particles, and the number of spin components. A series of comments are presented that characterize the minimal symmetries possible for a composite system constructed from interacting single particles, with special focus on the contact interaction. For five and more particles with internal components like spin, a kind of universality called algebraically solvability is lost.

abstract: We present two deterministic schemes for constructing a CNOT gate and a Toffoli gate on photon-atom and photon-atom-atom hybrid quantum systems assisted by bad cavities, respectively. They are achieved by cavity-assisted photon scattering and work in the intermediate coupling region with bad cavities, which relaxes the difficulty of their implementation in experiment. Also, bad cavities are feasible for fast quantum operations and reading out information. Compared with previous works, our schemes do not need any auxiliary qubits and measurements. Moreover, the quantum circuits for these gates are simple, especially that for our Toffoli gate as only a quarter wave packet is used to interact the photon with each of the atoms every time. These atom-cavity systems can be used as the quantum nodes in long-distance quantum communication as their relatively long coherence time is suitable for multi-time operations between the photon and the system. Our calculations show that the average fidelities and efficiencies of our two universal hybrid quantum gates are high with current experimental technology.

abstract: As a follow-up to a recent study in the spin-0 case [J. Bunao and E. A. Galapon, Ann. Phys. 353, 83-106 (2015)], we construct a one-particle Time of Arrival (TOA) operator conjugate to a Hamiltonian describing a free relativistic spin-1/2 particle in one spatial dimension. Upon transformation in a representation where the Hamiltonian is diagonal, it turns out that the constructed operator consists of an operator term $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$ whose action is the same as in the spin-0 case, and another operator term $\mathcal{\hat{T}}_0$ which commutes with the Hamiltonian but breaks invariance under parity inversion. If we must impose this symmetry on our TOA operator, then we can throw away $\mathcal{\hat{T}}_0$ so that the TOA operator is just $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$.

abstract: In the present work we introduce a new way of identifying quantum phase transitions of many-body systems by means of local time correlations and Leggett-Garg inequalities. This procedure allows to experimentally determine the quantum critical points not only of finite-order transitions but also those of infinite-order as the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that is not always easy to detect with current methods. By means of an analytical calculation on a general spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonian, and matrix product simulations of one-dimensional $XXZ$ and anisotropic $XY$ models, we argue that finite-order quantum phase transitions can be determined by singularities of the time correlations or their derivatives at criticality. The same features are exhibited by corresponding Leggett-Garg functions, which remarkably indicate violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities for early times and all the Hamiltonian parameters considered. In addition, we find that the infinite-order transition of the $XXZ$ model at the isotropic point can be revealed by the maximal violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities. We thus show that quantum phase transitions can be identified by purely local measurements, and that many-body systems constitute important candidates to observe experimentally the violation of Leggett-Garg inequalities.

abstract: We construct a one-particle TOA operator $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$ canonically conjugate with the Hamiltonian describing a free, charged, spin-$0$, relativistic particle in one spatial dimension and show that it is maximally symmetric. We solve for its eigenfunctions and show that they form a complete and non-orthogonal set. Plotting the time evolution of their corresponding probability densities, it implies that the eigenfunctions become more localized at the origin at the time equal to their eigenvalues. That is, a particle being described by an eigenfunction of $\mathcal{\hat{T}}$ is in a state of definite arrival time at the origin and at the corresponding eigenvalue. We also calculate the TOA probability distribution of a particle in some initial state.

abstract: Tests of local realism and macrorealism have historically been discussed in very similar terms: Leggett-Garg inequalities follow Bell inequalities as necessary conditions for classical behavior. Here, we compare the probability polytopes spanned by all measurable probability distributions for both scenarios and show that their structure differs strongly between spatially and temporally separated measurements. We arrive at the conclusion that, in contrast to tests of local realism where Bell inequalities form a necessary and sufficient set of conditions, no set of inequalities can ever be necessary and sufficient for macrorealism. A recently proposed condition, no-signaling in time, fulfills this criterion, and we show why it is better suited for future experimental tests of macrorealism.

abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle (PEP) has a tremendous impact on the properties and the behavior of most fermionic quantum systems. Remarkably, even stronger restrictions on fermionic natural occupation numbers follow from the fermionic exchange statistics. Based on a hierarchy induced by PEP we develop an operationally meaningful measure which allows to quantify the potential physical relevance of those generalized Pauli constraints (GPC) beyond the well-established relevance of PEP. By studying a few fermions in a harmonic trap we explore and confirm for the first time such nontrivial significance of GPC not only for weak couplings but even up to medium interaction strengths.

abstract: Optical lossless beam splitters are frequently encountered in fundamental physics experiments regarding the nature of light, including "which-way" determination of light particles, N. Bohr's complementarity principle, or the EPR paradox and all their measurement apparatus. Although they look as common optical components at first glance, their behaviour remains somewhat mysterious since they apparently exhibit stand-alone particle-like features, and then wave-like characteristics when inserted into a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In this communication are examined and discussed some basic properties of these beamssplitters, both from a classical optics and quantum physics point of view. Herein some convergences and contradictions are highlighted, and the results of a few emblematic experiments demonstrating photon existence are discussed. An alternative empirical model in wave optics is also proposed in order to shed light on some remaining questions

abstract: The entropic uncertainty relation proven by Maassen and Uffink for arbitrary pairs of two observables is known to be non-optimal. Here, we call an uncertainty relation optimal, if the lower bound can be attained for any value of either of the corresponding uncertainties. In this work we establish optimal uncertainty relations by characterising the optimal lower bound in scenarios similar to the Maassen-Uffink type. We disprove a conjecture by Englert et al. and generalise various previous results. However, we are still far from a complete understanding and, based on numerical investigation and analytical results in small dimension, we present a number of conjectures.

abstract: We address the task of switching off the Hamiltonian of a system by removing all internal and system-environment couplings. We propose dynamical decoupling schemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems with local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we introduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs) and show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The derived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex schemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of $n$ qubits and a $2$-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as $O(n \log n)$, improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled quadratically with $n$. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays constructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength decoupling for any $\ell$-local Hamiltonian, where $\ell \geq 2$, can be achieved using decoupling schemes of length at most $O(n^{\ell-1} \log n)$.

abstract: Too much noise kills entanglement. This is the main problem in its production and transmission. We use a handy approach to indicate noise resistance of entanglement of a bi-partite system described by $d\times d$ Hilbert space. Our analysis uses a geometric approach based on the fact that if a scalar product of a vector $\vec{s}$ with a vector $\vec {e}$ is less than the square of the norm of $\vec{e}$, then $\vec{s}\neq\vec{e}$. We use such concepts for correlation tensors of separable and entangled states. As a general form correlation tensors for pairs of qudits, for $d>2$, is very difficult to obtain, because one does not have a Bloch sphere for pure one qudit states, we use a simplified approach. The criterion reads: if the largest Schmidt eigenvalue of a correlation tensor is smaller than the square of its norm, then the state is entangled. this criterion is applied in the case of various types of noise admixtures to the initial (pure) state. These include white noise, colored noise, local depolarizing noise and amplitude damping noise. A broad set of numerical and analytical results is presented. As the other simple criterion for entanglement is violation of Bell's inequalities, we also find critical noise parameters to violate specific family of Bell inequalities (CGLMP), for maximally entangled states. We give analytical forms of our results for $d$ approaching infinity.

abstract: Despite its age quantum theory remains ill-understood, which is partially to blame on its deep interwovenness with the mysterious concept of quantization. In this article we argue that a quantum theory recoursing to quantization algorithms is necessarily incomplete. To provide a new axiomatic foundation, we give a rigorous proof showing how the Schr\"odinger equation follows from the Madelung equations, which are formulated in the language of Newtonian mechanics. We show how the Schr\"odinger picture relates to this Madelung picture and how the "classical limit" is directly obtained. This suggests a reformulation of the correspondence principle, stating that a quantum theory must reduce to a probabilistic version of Newtonian mechanics for large masses. We then enhance the stochastic interpretation developed by Tsekov, which speculates that quantum mechanical behavior is caused by random vibrations in spacetime. A new, yet incomplete model of particle creation and annihilation is also proposed.

We propose to combine these approaches into a scalable architecture in which a single optical parametric oscillator and simple interferometer entangle up to (3 x 10^3 frequencies) x (unlimited number of temporal modes) into a computationally universal continuous-variable cluster state.

In this paper we discuss the appearance of novel families of Efimov states in the spinor three-body problem.

abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems usually strongly depends on the local structure of the Hamiltonian. For short-range interacting systems, the well-known Lieb-Robinson bound defines the effective light cone with an exponentially small error with respect to the spatial distance, whereas we can obtain only polynomial bound for long-range interacting systems. In this letter, we derive a qualitatively new bound for quantum dynamics by considering a number of spin which can couple with each other after time evolution. Our bound is exponentially strong with respect to the number of coupling and valid for large class of Hamiltonians including long-range interacting systems. To demonstrate the potential of our approach in quantum many-body systems, we apply our bound to prove several fundamental properties which cannot be derived from the Lieb-Robinson bound.

abstract: The interaction of two identical three-level atoms of the types $V$, $\Xi$ and $\Lambda$ with a quantized cavity field as well as a driving external classical field is studied. Under two certain unitary transformations, the system is converted to a typical form of the Jaynes-Cummings model for two three-level atoms. The exact analytical solutions of the wave function for different considered atom-field systems are exactly obtained with the help of the Laplace transform technique, when the atoms are initially prepared in the topmost excited state and the quantized field is in a coherent state. In order to examine the nonclassicality features of the deduced states, the dynamics of the entanglement between subsystems is discussed via two well-known measures, namely, von Neumann entropy of the reduced state and negativity. In addition, we pay attention to the temporal behaviour of quantum statistics of the photons of the field and squeezing phenomenon. Meanwhile, the influence of the external classical field on the latter physical quantities is analyzed in detail. The results show that the mentioned quantities can be sensitively controlled via the external classical field. Also, numerical computations imply the fact that the nonclassicality features in $\Xi$-type three-level atomic system is more visible than the other two configurations. In addition, it is shown that in the particular case of $\Lambda$-type atomic system, the rank of the reduced density matrix of the three-level atoms is no larger than three, so that negativity fully captures the entanglement of this system and that such entanglement is distillable.

abstract: The potential capability of resonators based on two dimensional arrays of re-entrant posts (or 3D split-rings) is demonstrated. Each posts may be regarded as a lumped element microwave harmonic oscillator, arranged in a 2D lattice of magnetically coupled $LC$-circuits and enclosed in a 3D cavity. By arranging these elements in certain patterns, one can achieve certain requirements with respect to the field localisation and the device spectra, creating a discrete mode spectrum. Special attention is paid to symmetries of the lattices, mechanical tuning, design of the spots of high localisation of magnetic energy and the given the mode spectrum. The described cavity platform has a wide range of applications requiring high versatility of the design, localisation and high energy density of the electrical or magnetic fields and wide tuning range. Applications to optomechanical systems and quantum memory are considered. Finally, we propose a generalised approach to a microwave system design based on the concept of Programmable Cavity Arrays.

abstract: Quantum feedback is a technique for measuring a qubit and applying appropriate feedback depending on the measurement results. Here, we propose a new on-chip quantum feedback method where the measurement-result information is not taken from the chip to the outside of a dilution refrigerator. This can be done by using a selective qubit-energy shift induced by measurement apparatus. We demonstrate on-chip quantum feedback and succeed in the rapid initialization of a qubit by flipping the qubit state only when we detect the ground state of the qubit. The feedback loop of our quantum feedback method closed on a chip, and so the operating time needed to control a qubit is of the order of 10 ns. This operating time is shorter than with the convectional off-chip feedback method. Our on-chip quantum feedback technique opens many possibilities such as an application to quantum information processing and providing an understanding of the foundation of thermodynamics for quantum systems.

abstract: In this paper, we present a model which exhibits two identical $\Xi$-type three-level atoms interacting with a single-mode field with $k$-photon transition in an optical cavity enclosed by a Kerr medium. Considering full nonlinear formalism, it is assumed that the single-mode field, atom-field coupling and Kerr medium are all $f$-deformed. By using the adiabatic elimination method, it is shown that, the Hamiltonian of the considered system can be reduced to an effective Hamiltonian with two two-level atoms and $f$-deformed Stark shift. In spite of the fact that, the system seems to be complicated, under initial conditions which may be prepared for the atoms (coherent superposition of their ground and upper states) and the field (coherent state), the explicit form of the state vector of the entire system is analytically obtained. Then, the entanglement dynamics between different subsystems (i.e. "field-two atoms", "atom-(field+atom)" and "atom-atom") are evaluated through appropriate measures like von Neumann entropy, tangle and concurrence. In addition, the effects of intensity-dependent coupling, deformed Kerr medium, detuning parameter, deformed Stark shift and multi-photon process on the considered entanglement measures are numerically analyzed, in detail. It is shown that the degree of entanglement between subsystems can be controlled by selecting the evolved parameters, suitably. Briefly, the Kerr medium highly decreases the amount of different considered measures of entanglement, especially for two-photon transition. This destructive effect preserves even when all other parameters are present, too. Furthermore, we find that the so-called entanglement sudden death and birth can occur in the atom-atom entanglement.

abstract: We revisit the scheme of single-photon weak-coupling optomechanics using post-selection, proposed by Pepper, Ghobadi, Jeffrey, Simon and Bouwmeester [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 023601 (2012)], by analyzing the exact solution of the dynamical evolution. Positive and negative amplification effects of the displacement of the mirror's position can be generated when the Kerr phase is considered. This effect occurs when the post-selected state of the photon is orthogonal to the initial state, which can not be explained by the usual weak measurement results. The amplification effect can be further modulated by a phase shifter, and the maximal displacement state can appear within a short evolution time.

abstract: Weak measurement [1,19] combined with quantum delayed-choice experiment that use quantum beam splitter instead of the beam splitter give rise to a surprising amplification effect, i.e., counterintuitive negative amplification effect. We show that this effect is caused by the wave and particle behaviours of the system to be and can't be explained by a semiclassical wave theory, due to the entanglement of the system and the ancilla in quantum beam splitter. The amplification mechanism about wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics lead us to a scheme for implementation of weak measurement in optomechanical system.

abstract: I describe one quantum approach to solving 3-satisfiability (3-SAT), the well known problem in computer science. The approach is based on repeatedly measuring the truth value of the clauses forming the 3-SAT proposition using a non-orthogonal basis. If the basis slowly evolves then there is a strong analogy to adiabatic quantum computing, although the approach is entirely circuit-based. To solve a 3-SAT problem of n variables requires a quantum register of $n$ qubits, or more precisely rebits i.e. qubits whose phase need only be real. For cases of up to n=26 qubits numerical simulations indicate that the algorithm runs fast, outperforming Grover's algorithm and having a scaling with n that is superior to the best reported classical algorithms. There are indications that the approach has an inherent robustness versus imperfections in the elementary operations.

abstract: The scheme recently proposed in [M. Scala et al., Phys Rev Lett 111, 180403 (2013)], where a gravity-dependent phase shift is induced on the spin of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a trapped nanodiamond by the interaction between its magnetic moment and the quantized motion of the particle, provides a way to detect spatial quantum superpositions by means of spin measurements only. Here, the effect of unwanted coupling with other motional degrees of freedom is considered and we show that it does not affect the validity of the scheme. Both this coupling and the additional error source due to misalignment between the quantization axis of the NV center spin and the trapping axis are shown not to change the qualitative behavior of the system, so that a proof-of- principle experiment can be neatly performed. Our analysis, which shows that the scheme retains the important features of not requiring ground state cooling and of being resistant to thermal fluctuations, can be useful for the several schemes which have been proposed recently for testing macroscopic superpositions in trapped microsystems.

abstract: In Bohmian mechanics particles follow continuous trajectories, hence 2-time position correlations are well defined. Nevertheless, Bohmian mechanics predicts the violation of Bell inequalities. Motivated by this fact we investigate position measurements in Bohmian mechanics by coupling the particles to macroscopic pointers. This explains the violation of Bell inequalities despite 2-time position correlations. We relate this fact to so-called surrealistic trajectories that, in our model, correspond to slowly moving pointers. Next, we emphasize that the nice feature of Bohmian mechanics, which doesn't distinguish microscopic and macroscopic systems, implies that the quantum weirdness of quantum physics also shows up at the macro-scale. Finally, we discuss the fact that Bohmian mechanics is attractive to philosophers, but not so much to physicists and argue that the Bohmian community is responsible for the latter.

abstract: Improvement in secure transmission of information is an urgent practical need for governments, corporations and individuals. Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises security based on the laws of physics and has rapidly grown from proof-of-concept to robust demonstrations and even deployment of commercial systems. Despite these advances, QKD has not been widely adopted, and practical large-scale deployment will likely require integrated chip-based devices for improved performance, miniaturisation and enhanced functionality, fully integrated into classical communication networks. Here we report low error rate, GHz clocked QKD operation of an InP transmitter chip and a SiO$_x$N$_y$ receiver chip --- monolithically integrated devices that use state-of-the-art components and manufacturing processes from the telecom industry. We use the reconfigurability of these devices to demonstrate three important QKD protocols --- BB84, Coherent One Way (COW) and Differential Phase Shift (DPS) --- with performance comparable to state-of-the-art. These devices, when combined with integrated single photon detectors, satisfy the requirements at each of the levels of future QKD networks --- from point-of-use through to backbone --- and open the way to operation in existing and emerging classical communication networks.

abstract: We present an asymmetric step-barrier potential for which the one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation is exactly solved in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given in terms of the Lambert W-function, which is an implicitly elementary function also known as the product logarithm. We present the general solution of the problem and consider the quantum reflection in transmission of a particle above this potential barrier. Compared with the abrupt-step and hyperbolic tangent potentials, which are reproduced by the Lambert potential in certain parameter and/or variable variation regions, the reflection coefficient is smaller because of the lesser steepness of the potential on the incidence side. Presenting the derivation of the Lambert potential we show that this is a four-parametric sub-potential of a more general five-parametric one also solvable in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The latter potential, however, is a conditionally integrable one. Finally, we show that there exists one more potential the solution for which is written in terms of the derivative of a bi-confluent Heun function.

abstract: We demonstrate and contrast two approaches to the stabilization of qubit entanglement by feedback. Our demonstration is built on a feedback platform consisting of two superconducting qubits coupled to a cavity which are measured by a nearly-quantum-limited measurement chain and controlled by high-speed classical logic circuits. This platform is used to stabilize entanglement by two nominally distinct schemes: a "passive" reservoir engineering method and an "active" correction based on conditional parity measurements. In view of the instrumental roles that these two feedback paradigms play in quantum error-correction and quantum control, we directly compare them on the same experimental setup. Further, we show that a second layer of feedback can be added to each of these schemes, which heralds the presence of a high-fidelity entangled state in realtime. This "nested" feedback brings about a marked entanglement fidelity improvement without sacrificing success probability.

abstract: By using a condition of average trace preservation we derive a general class of non-Markovian Gaussian diffusive unravelings [L. Diosi and L. Ferialdi, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{113}, 200403 (2014)], here valid for arbitrary non-Hermitian system operators and noise correlations. The conditions under which the generalized stochastic Schrodinger equation has the same symmetry properties (invariance under unitary changes of operator base) than a microscopic system-bath Hamiltonian dynamics are determined. While the standard quantum diffusion model (standard noise correlations) always share the same invariance symmetry, the generalized stochastic dynamics can be mapped with an arbitrary bosonic environment only if some specific correlation constraints are fulfilled. These features are analyzed for different non-Markovian unravelings equivalent in average. Results based on quantum measurement theory that lead to specific cases of the generalized dynamics [J. Gambetta and H. M. Wiseman, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{66}, 012108 (2002)]\ are studied from the perspective of the present analysis.

abstract: We determine the minimum energy required to control the evolution of any mesoscopic quantum system in the presence of arbitrary Markovian noise processes. This result provides the mesoscopic equivalent of the fundamental cost of refrigeration, sets the minimum power consumption of mesoscopic devices that operate out of equilibrium, and allows one to calculate the efficiency of any control protocol, whether it be open-loop or feedback control. As examples we calculate the energy cost of maintaining a qubit in the ground state, the efficiency of resolved-sideband cooling of nano-mechanical resonators, and discuss the energy cost of quantum information processing.

abstract: The analysis of a physical problem simplifies considerably when one uses a suitable coordinate system. We apply this approach to the discrete-time quantum walks with coins given by $2j+1$-dimensional Wigner rotation matrices (Wigner walks), a model which was introduced in T. Miyazaki et al., Phys. Rev. A 76, 012332 (2007). First, we show that from the three parameters of the coin operator only one is physically relevant for the limit density of the Wigner walk. Next, we construct a suitable basis of the coin space in which the limit density of the Wigner walk acquires a much simpler form. This allows us to identify various dynamical regimes which are otherwise hidden in the standard basis description. As an example, we show that it is possible to find an initial state which reduces the number of peaks in the probability distribution from generic $2j+1$ to a single one. Moreover, the models with integer $j$ lead to the trapping effect. The derived formula for the trapping probability reveals that it can be highly asymmetric and it deviates from purely exponential decay. Explicit results are given up to the dimension five.

Within this setup, we show how the optical bistability picture induced by the radiation-pressure force is modified by the presence of the cross-Kerr interaction term. More specifically, we show how the optically bistable region, characterising the pure radiation-pressure case, is reduced by the presence of a cross-Kerr coupling term. At the same time, the upper unstable branch is extended by the presence of a moderate cross-Kerr term, while it is reduced for larger values of the cross-Kerr coupling.

abstract: Semiconductor microcavities with artificial single-photon emitters have become one of the backbones of semiconductor quantum optics. In many cases however, technical and physical issues limit the study of optical fields to incoherently excited systems. We analyze the model of a two-level system in a single-mode cavity, where the former is incoherently driven. The specific structure of the applied master equation yields a recurrence relation for the steady-state values of correlations of the intracavity field and the emitter. We provide boundary conditions, that permit a systematical, easy to implement solution, which is numerically less demanding than standard methods. Different cavity systems from previous experiments are analyzed. The derived boundary conditions also allow us direct analytical statements about the overall quantum state and its higher order moments. With this we can give very good approximations for the full quantum state of the field and show, that for every physically reasonable set of system parameters, the state of the intracavity field is nonclassical.

abstract: We study the nonlocality of arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum states. By computing the maximal violation of a set of multi-setting Bell inequalities, an analytical and computable lower bound has been derived for general two-qubit states. This bound gives the necessary condition that a two-qubit state admits no local hidden variable models. The lower bound is shown to be better than that from the CHSH inequality in judging the nonlocality of some quantum states. The results are generalized to the case of high dimensional quantum states, and a sufficient condition for detecting the non-locality has been presented.

abstract: Ensemble of identical two level atoms in dark state neither adsorbs nor emits photons due to destructive interference. It can be used for the source of energy for nano-devices. In Tavis-Cummings cavity the change of light-atom coupling cannot destroy the dark state. We propose the method of dark states preparation based on photon pumping and drain from the optical cavity with two atoms, one from which has Stark or Zeeman splitting of energy levels. This splitting is removed before photon drain from the cavity. The dark state yield after one such cycle has the order of energy level splitting. We show the scheme of the experiment, in which such cycles repeat until the dark state is produced with high probability and the results of computer simulation.

abstract: An essential element of classical computation is the "if-then" construct, that accepts a control bit and an arbitrary gate, and provides conditional execution of the gate depending on the value of the controlling bit. On the other hand, quantum theory prevents the existence of an analogous universal construct accepting a control qubit and an arbitrary quantum gate as its input. Nevertheless, there are controllable sets of quantum gates for which such a construct exists. Here we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of unitary transformations to be controllable, and we give a complete characterization of controllable sets in the two dimensional case. This result reveals an interesting connection between the problem of controllability and the problem of extracting information from an unknown quantum gate while using it.

abstract: The density-functional approach to quantum electrodynamics is extending traditional density-functional theory and opens the possibility to describe electron-photon interactions in terms of effective Kohn-Sham potentials. In this work, we numerically construct the exact electron-photon Kohn-Sham potentials for a prototype system which consists of a trapped electron coupled to a quantized electromagnetic mode in an optical high-Q cavity. While the effective current that acts on the photons is known explicitly, the exact effective potential that describes the forces exerted by the photons on the electrons is obtained from a fixed-point inversion scheme. This procedure allows us to uncover important beyond-mean-field features of the effective potential which mark the breakdown of classical light-matter interactions. We observe peak and step structures in the effective potentials, which can be attributed solely to the quantum nature of light, i.e., they are real-space signatures of the photons. Our findings show how the ubiquitous dipole interaction with a classical electromagnetic field has to be modified in real-space in order to take the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field fully into account.

abstract: Nonclassical states of light play a central role in many quantum information protocols. Their quantum features have been exploited to improve the readout of information from digital memories, modelled as arrays of microscopic beam splitters [S. Pirandola, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 090504 (2011)]. In this model of "quantum reading", a nonclassical source of light with Einstein-Podolski-Rosen correlations has been proven to retrieve more information than any classical source. In particular, the quantum-classical comparison has been performed under a global energy constraint, i.e., by fixing the mean total number of photons irradiated over each memory cell. In this paper we provide an alternative analysis which is based on a local energy constraint, meaning that we fix the mean number of photons per signal mode irradiated over the memory cell. Under this assumption, we investigate the critical number of signal modes after which a nonclassical source of light is able to beat any classical source irradiating the same number of signals.

abstract: Classical thermodynamics is unrivalled in its range of applications and relevance to everyday life. It enables a description of complex systems, made up of microscopic particles, in terms of a small number of macroscopic quantities, such as work and entropy. As systems get ever smaller, fluctuations of these quantities become increasingly relevant, prompting the development of stochastic thermodynamics. Recently we have seen a surge of interest in exploring the quantum regime, where the origin of fluctuations is quantum rather than thermal. Many questions, such as the role of entanglement and the emergence of thermalisation, lie wide open. Answering these questions may lead to the development of quantum heat engines and refrigerators, as well as to vitally needed simple descriptions of quantum many-body systems.

abstract: We consider two bosonic Gaussian channels whose thermal noise is strong enough to break bipartite entanglement. In this scenario, we show how the presence of separable correlations between the two channels is able to restore the broken entanglement. This reactivation occurs not only in a scheme of direct distribution, where a third party (Charlie) broadcasts entangled states to remote parties (Alice and Bob), but also in a configuration of indirect distribution which is based on entanglement swapping. In both schemes, the amount of entanglement remotely activated can be large enough to be distilled by one-way distillation protocols.

abstract: Besides achieving secure communication between two spatially-separated parties, another important issue in modern cryptography is related to secure communication in time, i.e., the possibility to confidentially store information on a memory for later retrieval. Here we explore this possibility in the setting of quantum reading, which exploits quantum entanglement to efficiently read data from a memory whereas classical strategies (e.g., based on coherent states or their mixtures) cannot retrieve any information. From this point of view, the technique of quantum reading can provide a new form of technological security for data storage.

abstract: We consider two remote parties connected to a relay by two quantum channels. To generate a secret key, they transmit coherent states to the relay, where the states are subject to a continuous-variable (CV) Bell detection. We study the ideal case where Alice's channel is lossless, i.e., the relay is locally situated in her lab and the Bell detection is performed with unit efficiency. This configuration allows us to explore the optimal performances achievable by CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD). This corresponds to the limit of a trusted local relay, where the detection loss can be re-scaled. Our theoretical analysis is confirmed by an experimental simulation where 10^-4 secret bits per use can potentially be distributed at 170km assuming ideal reconciliation.

abstract: As experimental quantum information processing (QIP) rapidly advances, an emerging challenge is to design a scalable architecture that combines various quantum elements into a complex device without compromising their performance. In particular, superconducting quantum circuits have successfully demonstrated many of the requirements for quantum computing, including coherence levels that approach the thresholds for scaling. However, it remains challenging to couple a large number of circuit components through controllable channels while suppressing any other interactions. We propose a hardware platform intended to address these challenges, which combines the advantages of integrated circuit fabrication and long coherence times achievable in three-dimensional circuit quantum electrodynamics (3D cQED). This multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuit (MMIQC) platform provides a path toward the realization of increasingly complex superconducting devices in pursuit of a scalable quantum computer.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01150
abstract: The Kapitza-Dirac effect, which refers to electron scattering at standing light waves, is studied in the Bragg regime with counterpropagating elliptically polarized electromagnetic waves having the same intensity, wavelength, and degree of polarization for two different setups. In the first setup, where the electric field components of the counterpropagating waves have the same sense of rotation, we find distinct spin effects. The spin of the scattered electrons and of the nonscattered electrons, respectively, precesses with a frequency that is of the order of the Bragg-reflection Rabi frequency. When the electric field components of the counterpropagating waves have opposite sense of rotation, which is the second considered setup, the standing wave has linear polarization and no spin effects can be observed. Our results are based on numerical solutions of the time-dependent Dirac equation and the analytical solution of a relativistic Pauli equation, which accounts for the leading relativistic effects.

abstract: We model repetitive quantum error correction (QEC) with the single-error-correcting five-qubit code on a network of individually-controlled qubits with always-on Ising couplings, using our previously designed universal set of quantum gates based on sequences of shaped decoupling pulses. In addition to serving as accurate quantum gates, the sequences also provide dynamical decoupling (DD) of low-frequency phase noise. The simulation involves integrating unitary dynamics of six qubits over the duration of tens of thousands of control pulses, using classical stochastic phase noise as a source of decoherence. The combined DD/QEC protocol dramatically improves the coherence, with the QEC alone responsible for more than an order of magnitude infidelity reduction.

abstract: Sources of photon pairs based on the spontaneous parametric down conversion process are commonly used for long distance quantum communication. The key feature for improving the range of transmission is engineering their spectral properties. Following two experimental papers [Opt. Lett., 38, 697 (2013)] and [Opt. Lett., 39, 1481 (2014)] we analytically and numerically analyze the characteristics of a source. It is based on a $\beta$-barium borate (BBO) crystal cut for type II phase matching at the degenerated frequencies 755 nm $\rightarrow$ 1550 nm + 1550 nm. Our analysis shows a way for full control of spectral correlation within a fiber-coupled photon pair simultaneously with optimal brightness.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01265
abstract: The Madelung equations map the non-relativistic time-dependent Schrodinger equation into hydrodynamic equations of a virtual fluid. In this short note we show that an increase of the quantum fluid's Gibbs entropy is proportional to the expectation value of the Madelung fluid divergence results from advective processes. Therefore, it must be accompanied by expansion of the Madelung fluid. This intuitive result stands in agreement with the consequence of previous energy considerations of the Madelung fluid in which adiabatic expansion increases "disorder" and decreases the internal energy represented by the Fisher information. We also show that unlike diffusive processes, the entropy production is not proportional to the Fisher information, simply because the quantum continuity equation does not obey Fick's second law. Nonetheless, the entropy production is also equal to the expectation value of the inner product between the advective and the diffusive velocities of the Madelung fluid, which are proportional respectively to the real and imaginary parts of the complex momentum. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient of the Madelung fluid, in its simplest form of ideal gas, gives rise to the lower bound of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in terms of the gas mean free path and the Brownian momentum.

abstract: In the paper we define a notion of quantum resistant ($(\epsilon,\delta)$-resistant) hash function which combine together a notion of pre-image (one-way) resistance ($\epsilon$-resistance) property we define in the paper and the notion of collision resistance ($\delta$-resistance) properties. We show that in the quantum setting a one-way resistance property and collision resistance property are correlated: the "more" a quantum function is one-way resistant the "less" it collision resistant and vice versa. We present an explicit quantum hash function which is "balanced" one-way resistant and collision resistant and demonstrate how to build a large family quantum hash functions. Balanced quantum hash functions need a high degree of entanglement between the qubits. We use a "phase constructions" technique to express quantum hashing constructions, which is good to map hash states to coherent states in a superposition of time-bin modes. The later is ready to be implemented with current optical technology.

authors: Seth Lloyd, Barbara Terhal

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01278
abstract: We show how to perform universal Hamiltonian and adiabatic computing using a time-independent Hamiltonian on a 2D grid describing a system of hopping particles which string together and interact to perform the computation. In this construction, the movement of one particle is controlled by the presence or absence of other particles, an effective quantum field effect transistor that allows the construction of controlled-NOT and controlled-rotation gates. The construction translates into a model for universal quantum computation with time-independent 2-qubit ZZ and XX+YY interactions on an (almost) planar grid. The effective Hamiltonian is arrived at by a single use of first-order perturbation theory avoiding the use of perturbation gadgets. The dynamics and spectral properties of the effective Hamiltonian can be fully determined as it corresponds to a particular realization of a mapping between a quantum circuit and a Hamiltonian called the space-time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction. Because of the simple interactions required, and because no higher-order perturbation gadgets are employed, our construction is potentially realizable using superconducting or other solid-state qubits.

The two components of the superposition can differ by of order 250 eV in energy, allowing highly sensitive tests of energy decoherence models. We take into account the effects of higher-order nonlinearities, spatial inhomogeneity of the interaction, decay from the Rydberg state, and diminishing Rydberg level separation for increasing principal number.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01373
abstract: We test the validity of Feynman's idea that a two-slit experiment performed with classical objects (bullets) does not produce observable interference fringes on the detection screen because the Compton's wavelength of the bullets is so tiny, that no real detector could resolve individual interference fringes, thus producing only an average signal which is the observed smooth curve. To test this idea, we study the two-slit experiment in two different situations using light to simulate both wave-like and particle-like bullets. In the first case, we consider coherent light with short wavelengths and in the second case incoherent light with not-so-short wavelength. While in the former case (simulating Feynman's wave-like bullets) the interference fringes are so dense that they cannot be resolved by a detector, therefore resulting in an averaged smooth signal, in the latter case (simulating Feynman's particle-like bullets), although the detector is fully capable of discriminating each fringe, the observed classical smooth pattern limit is produced because of the lack of spatial coherence of the impinging field.

abstract: We present an analytical solution for classical correlation, defined in terms of linear entropy, in an arbitrary $d\otimes 2$ system when the second subsystem is measured. We show that the optimal measurements used in the maximization of the classical correlation in terms of linear entropy, when used to calculate the quantum discord in terms of von Neumann entropy, result in a tight upper bound for arbitrary $d\otimes 2$ systems. This bound agrees with all known analytical results about quantum discord in terms of von Neumann entropy and, when comparing it with the numerical results for $10^6$ two-qubit random density matrices, we obtain an average deviation of order $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, our results give a way to calculate the quantum discord for arbitrary $n$-qubit GHZ and W states evolving under the action of the amplitude damping noisy channel.

abstract: In this work I show that the hybrid ground state of a quantum system, which consists of particles dipole-coupled to photons in a cavity, is uniquely determined by the charge density of the particles and the expectation value of the displacement operators of the cavity modes. This result extends ground-state density-functional theory to include photons and allows to determine all properties of the coupled quantum system by only knowing these two observables. The corresponding Kohn-Sham scheme shows how the photon field can be replaced by a classical electro-magnetic field and a non-linear coupling to the particles.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.01435
abstract: Collective coherent scattering of laser light induces strong light forces between polarizable point particles. These dipole forces are strongly enhanced in magnitude and distance within the field of an optical waveguide so that at low temperature the particles self-order in strongly bound regular patterns. The stationary configurations typically exhibit super-radiant scattering with strong particle and light confinement. Here we study collective excitations of such self-consistent crystalline particle-light structures as function of particle number and pump strength. Multiple scattering and absorption modify the collective particle-field eigenfrequencies and create eigenmodes of surprisingly complex nature. For larger arrays this often leads to dynamical instabilities and disintegration of the structures even if additional damping is present.

We focus on Glauber's wave function for the emitted photon, a quantity which we find is nonzero outside the lightcone at all times after the start of the emission. We identify the uncertainty on the position of the decaying electron as a source of departure from causality in the naive sense of the term. We carry out a detailed study of the emitted electric field in the mid- and far-field regions, through analytical and numerical computations as well as asymptotic arguments.

abstract: A quantum simulator allows for investigating static and dynamic properties of a complex quantum system, difficult to access directly, by means of another physical system that is well understood and controlled. A universal quantum computer would be suitable for that purpose. However, other, more specialized physical systems -- already in close experimental reach -- promise groundbreaking new insight in quantum phenomena when used as quantum simulators. Here, we show how a tailored and versatile effective spin-system suitable for quantum simulations and universal quantum computation is realized using trapped atomic ions. Each single spin can be addressed individually, and, simply by the application of microwave pulses, selected spins can be decoupled from the remaining system. Furthermore, the sign of the couplings can be changed, as well as the effective strength of spin-spin coupling determined. Thus, all operations for a versatile quantum simulator are implemented. In addition, taking advantage of simultaneous coupling between three spins a coherent quantum Fourier transform -- an essential building block for many quantum algorithms -- is efficiently realized. This approach based on microwave-driven trapped ions, complementary to laser-based methods, opens a new route to overcome technical and physics challenges in the quest for a quantum simulator and quantum computer.

abstract: We introduce a coarse-graining procedure based on matrix product operators to define a hybrid variational ansatz combining ideas of matrix product states (MPS), Wilson's numerical renormalization group and entanglement renormalization. As a primary application, we show how the infinite quantum transfer matrix, associated to the path integral description of a translation invariant quantum system, can be coarse-grained to obtain a layered decomposition of a uniform MPS with finite bond dimension. Through numerical comparison with conventional MPS algorithms, we explicitly verify the impurity interpretation of MPS compression, as put forward by Zauner et al., for the transverse field Ising model. Additionally, we motivate the conceptual usefulness of endowing MPS with an internal layered structure and study restricted variational subspaces to describe elementary excitations on top of the ground state, which serves to elucidate the renormalization group structure ingrained in MPS descriptions of ground states.

abstract: The generalized bunching (antibunching) corresponds to the maximum (minimum) probability of detecting all identical particles in a subset of output modes of a unitary linear network with arbitrary state of single particles at the input. The generalized antibunching is shown to be a universal (i.e., network-independent) attribute of the completely indistinguishable fermions. The generalized bunching is generally a network-dependent effect, if quantum-correlated states of identical particles are allowed at a network input. Using numerical simulations and an old conjecture in linear algebra, we show that the generalized bunching is an universal attribute of the completely indistinguishable bosons in two cases: for $\mathcal{K}\ge N$ output modes for $N$ particles or for $\mathcal{K}\ge 1$ output modes for only classically-correlated states of particles. The generalized bunching allows for an efficient verification of the BosonSampling with \textit{an arbitrary network}.

abstract: Recently, consensus-type problems have been formulated in the quantum domain. Obtaining average quantum consensus consists in the dynamical symmetrization of a multipartite quantum system while preserving the expectation of a given global observable. In this paper, two improved ways of obtaining consensus via dissipative engineering are introduced, which exploit quasi local preparation of mixtures of symmetric pure states, and show better performance in terms of purity dynamics with respect to existing algorithms. In addition, the second method guarantees a stronger type of consensus, namely single-measurement consensus. This implies that outcomes of local measurements on different subsystems are perfectly correlated when consensus is achieved. Both dynamics can be randomized and are suitable for feedback implementation.

abstract: While quantum mechanics exquisitely describes the behavior of microscopic systems, one ongoing challenge is to explore its applicability to systems of larger size and mass. Unfortunately, quantum states of increasingly macroscopic objects are more easily corrupted by unintentional measurements from the classical environment. Additionally, even the intentional measurements from the observer can further perturb the system. In optomechanics, coherent light fields serve as the intermediary between the fragile mechanical states and our inherently classical world by exerting radiation pressure forces and extracting mechanical information. Here we engineer a microwave cavity optomechanical system to stabilize a nonclassical steady-state of motion while independently, continuously, and nondestructively monitoring it. By coupling the motion of an aluminum membrane to two microwave cavities, we separately prepare and measure a squeezed state of motion. We demonstrate a quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of sub-vacuum mechanical quadrature fluctuations. The techniques developed here have direct applications in the areas of quantum-enhanced sensing and quantum information processing, and could be further extended to more complex quantum states.

We find that the sensitivity to magnetic fields can be significantly improved in isotopically purified diamond. Furthermore, the long-term stability of magnetic field measurements is significantly enhanced, thereby reducing the minimum detectable long-term field variations for both quasi-static and periodic fields. The method is useful both for sensing applications and as a spin qubit manipulation technique.

abstract: It is shown that the semiclassical coherent state propagator takes its simplest form when the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian is replaced by its Weyl symbol in defining the classical action, in that there is then no need of a Solari-Kochetov correction. It is also shown that such a correction exists if a symbol other than the Weyl symbol is chosen, and that its form is different depending on the symbol chosen. The various forms of the propagator based on different symbols are shown to be equivalent provided the correspondingly correct Solari-Kochetov correction is included. All these results are shown for both particle and spin coherent state propagators. The global anomaly in the fluctuation determinant is further elucidated by a study of the connection bewteen the discrete fluctuation determinant and the discrete Jacobi equation.

abstract: Everyday experience supports the existence of physical properties independent of observation in strong contrast to the predictions of quantum theory. In particular, existence of physical properties that are independent of the measurement context is prohibited for certain quantum systems. This property is known as contextuality. This paper studies whether the process of decay in space-time generally destroys the ability of revealing contextuality. We find that in the most general situation the decay property does not diminish this ability. However, applying certain constraints due to the space-time structure either on the time evolution of the decaying system or on the measurement procedure, the criteria revealing contextuality become inherently dependent on the decay property or an impossibility. In particular, we derive how the context-revealing setup known as Bell's nonlocality tests changes for decaying quantum systems. Our findings illustrate the interdependence between hidden and local hidden parameter theories and the role of time.

abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in our understanding of quantum many body physics, and is fundamental in characterising quantum phases and quantum phase transitions. Developing protocols to detect and quantify entanglement of many-particle quantum states is thus a key challenge for present experiments. Here, we show that the quantum Fisher information, representing a witness for genuinely multipartite entanglement, becomes measurable for thermal ensembles via the dynamic susceptibility, i.e., with resources readily available in present cold atomic gas and condensed-matter experiments. This moreover establishes a fundamental connection between multipartite entanglement and many-body correlations contained in response functions, with profound implications close to quantum phase transitions. There, the quantum Fisher information becomes universal, allowing us to identify strongly entangled phase transitions with a divergent multipartiteness of entanglement. We illustrate our framework using paradigmatic quantum Ising models, and point out potential signatures in optical-lattice experiments.

In sharply contrast to the super-operator method, the KBES method is applicable for any master equation of finite-level system in theory, and the calculation can be completed by computer. With this method, we obtain the exact dynamic evolution of a radioactivity damped 2-level atom in time-dependent external field, and a 3-level atom coupled with bath; Moreover, the master equation of N-qubits Heisenberg chain each qubit coupled with a reservoir is also resolved in Sec.III; Besides, the paper briefly discuss the physical implications of the solution.

abstract: We address the problem of detecting non-locality in coupled N level systems in the language of spin. Through a number of examples, we show that non-locality can be detected via a violation of the standard Bell inequality, irrespective of what N is, with correlations from observables of order k ~ 2s in the fundamental spin operators. We further show that, contrarily, if the order k is frozen, then non-locality eludes a detection when s >> k, leading to a weak classical limit. Armed with these results, we proceed to characterize observables that 'genuinely' reflect non-locality in higher dimensions, and demonstrate that one needs to go beyond the standard set-ups such as Stern-Gerlach and those with correlations involving measurement of spin projections along quantization axes.

abstract: Accessing the connection between classical chaos and quantum many-body systems has been a long-standing experimental challenge. Here, we investigate the onset of chaos in periodically driven two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, whose small quantum uncertainties allow for exploring the phase space with high resolution. By analyzing the uncertainties of time-evolved many-body states, we find signatures of elliptic and hyperbolic periodic orbits generated according to the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff theorem, and the formation of a chaotic region at increasing driving strengths. The employed fluctuation analysis allows for probing the phase-space structure by use of only short-time quantum dynamics.

abstract: In the general bipartite quantum system $m \otimes n$, Wang \emph{et al.} [Y.-L Wang \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{92}, 032313 (2015)] presented $3(m+n)-9$ orthogonal product states which cannot be distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In this paper, we aim to construct less locally indistinguishable orthogonal product states in $m\otimes n $. First, in $3\otimes n (3< n)$ quantum system, we construct $3n-2$ locally indistinguishable orthogonal product states which are not unextendible product bases. Then, for $m\otimes n (4\leq m\leq n)$, we present $3n+m-4$ orthogonal product states which cannot be perfectly distinguished by LOCC. Finally, in the general bipartite quantum system $m\otimes n(3\leq m\leq n)$, we show a smaller set with $2n-1$ orthogonal product states and prove that these states are LOCC indistinguishable using a very simple but quite effective method. All of the above results demonstrate the phenomenon of nonlocality without entanglement.

abstract: We present a new method for describing quantum measurements in relativistic systems that applies (i) to any QFT and for any field-detector coupling, (ii) to the measurement of any observable, and (iii) to arbitrary size, shape and motion of the detector. We explicitly construct the probabilities associated to $n$ measurement events, while treating the spacetime coordinates of the events are random variables. These probabilities define a linear functional of a $2n$ unequal time correlation function of the field, and thus, they are Poincar\'e covariant. The probability assignment depends on the properties of the measurement apparatuses, their state of motion, intrinsics dynamics, initial states and couplings to the measured field. For each apparatus, this information is contained in a function, the detector kernel, that enters into the probability assignment. In a companion paper, we construct the detector kernel for different types of measurement.

abstract: This is the second paper on a new formalism for relativistic quantum measurements. Here, we construct a fully relativistic model for detectors that takes into account the detector's state of motion, intrinsics dynamics, initial states and couplings to the measured field. The dual classical/quantum description of the detector is implemented by using a master-equation type of approximation for the coarse-grained pointer variables. Then we identify the probabilities that correspond to ideal measurements, i.e., measurements that are largely insensitive to modeling details of the apparatus. The Unruh-Dewitt and Glauber detectors are recovered at the appropriate limits. We employ our results to models of particle detection, photodetection and relativistic spin measurements, and we derive an ideal distribution for relativistic time-of-arrival probabilities.

abstract: We study the energy relaxation times ($T_1$) of superconducting transmon qubits in 3D cavities as a function of dielectric participation ratios of material surfaces. This surface participation ratio, representing the fraction of electric field energy stored in a dissipative surface layer, is computed by a two-step finite-element simulation and experimentally varied by qubit geometry. With a clean electromagnetic environment and suppressed non-equilibrium quasiparticle density, we find an approximately proportional relation between the transmon relaxation rates and surface participation ratios. These results suggest dielectric dissipation arising from material interfaces is the major limiting factor for the $T_1$ of transmons in 3D cQED architecture. Our analysis also supports the notion of spatial discreteness of surface dielectric dissipation.

abstract: Unitary processes allow for the transfer of work to and from Hamiltonian systems. However, to achieve non-zero power for the practical extraction of work, these processes must be performed within a finite-time, which inevitably induces excitations in the system. We characterize this by introducing a measure that indicates the need for an external driving to preserve quantum adiabaticity. We show that depending on the time-scale of the process and the physical realization of the external driving employed, the use of transitionless quantum driving (TQD) to extract more work is not always effective. Furthermore, by virtue of the two-time energy measurement definition of quantum work, we also demonstrate that the cost of TQD can be significantly reduced by selecting a restricted form of the driving Hamiltonian that depends on the outcome of the first energy measurement. We apply our analysis to systems ranging from a two-level Landau-Zener problem to a many-body quantum Ising chain.

abstract: We extend the concepts of quantum complete synchronization and phase synchronization, which are proposed firstly in [Phys. Rev. Lett, 111 103605 (2013)], to more widespread quantum generalized synchronization. The generalized synchronization can be considered as a necessary condition or a more flexible derivative of complete synchronization, and its criterion and synchronization measurement are further proposed and analyzed in this paper. As an example, we consider two typical generalized synchronizations in a designed optomechanical system. Unlike the effort to construct a special coupling synchronization system, we purposefully design extra control fields based on Lyapunov control theory. We find that the Lyapunov function can adapt to more flexible control objectives, which is more suitable for generalized synchronization control, and the control fields can be achieved simply with a time-variant voltage. Finally, the existence of quantum entanglement in different generalized synchronizations is also discussed.

abstract: The most general class of Bell's inequalities for $N$-partite $d$-chotomic systems, with $k$ number of obervables, is derived using the formalism of generic correlation functions, which are obtained as a fourier transformation of probability spectrums. It is found that they provide full description of the probability space together with corresponding operator decomposition for experimentally accessible local measurement settings. It turns out that the conditions for the local hidden variable (LHV) model are violated by quantum correlated states in general and they constitute the general correlation space for Bell theorem. It provides the most general constraints for the LHV model and the conditions for the quantum violation. Quantum violation is evident by maximally entangled states.

abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum error correction is an absolute necessity for any quantum architecture destined to tackle interesting, large-scale quantum algorithms. The theoretical formalism of quantum error correction codes, fault-tolerant circuit constructions, gate decompositions and relevant optimisations have been well founded for nearly two decades. However, at this point we still do not have a reliable compiler to adapt a high level circuit description to a fully fault-tolerant, error corrected description. There are many technical hurdles to this, including dynamic circuit constructions that occur due to teleportation protocols necessary to achieve fault-tolerance with commonly used error correction codes. We combine multiple results to develop a package that takes any high level quantum circuit consisting of CNOT, Toffoli, Controlled-$\sqrt{X}$ and arbitrary single qubit rotations and converts it to a equivalent quantum circuit employing ancillary protocols needed for fault-tolerant error correction. We call this representation the (I)initialisation, (C)NOT, (M)measurement representation (ICM) and consists of an initialisation layer of qubits into one of four distinct states, a massive array of CNOT operations that implement the relevant algorithmic decompositions and fault-tolerant ancillary protocols and a series of time ordered $X$- and $Z$-basis measurements. Our package will output either a standard circuit description or a canonical geometric structure that represents its implementation for topological quantum codes that can be further optimised and implemented on actual quantum hardware.

abstract: We describe the entanglement of two delocalized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the simplest spatial configuration of three spatial modes with at most one particle per mode. It is show that this is the only number of modes for which maximally entangled states exist in such a system. The set of entangled states, including the set of maximally entangled states, is described and different types of entanglement in terms of Bell-nonlocal correlations for different partitions of the system are identified. In particular we focus on the entangled states that are Bell-local for a tri-partition of the system and cannot be described as a superposition of bi-partite entangled pairs of localized particles. Two entanglement monotones are constructed and it is shown that all other monotones are functions of these. Furthermore, the system has a generic non-trivial local unitary symmetry with a corresponding $2\pi/3$ fractional topological phase.

abstract: We analyze the influence of relativistic effects on the minimum evolution time between two orthogonal states of a quantum system. Defining the initial state as an homogeneous superposition between two Hamiltonian eigenstates of an electron in a uniform magnetic field, we obtain a relation between the minimum evolution time and the displacement of the mean radial position of the electron wavepacket. The quantum speed limit time is calculated for an electron dynamics described by Dirac and Schroedinger-Pauli equations considering different parameters, such as the strength of magnetic field and the linear momentum of the electron in the axial direction. We highlight that when the electron undergoes a region with extremely strong magnetic field the relativistic and non-relativistic dynamics differ substantially, so that the description given by Schroedinger-Pauli equation enables the electron traveling faster than c, which is prohibited by Einstein's theory of relativity. This approach allows a connection between the abstract Hilbert space and the space-time coordinates, besides the identification of the most appropriate quantum dynamics used to describe the electron motion.

abstract: Computing entanglement of an arbitrary bipartite or multipartite mixed state is in general not an easy task as it usually involves complex optimization. Here we show that exploiting symmetries of certain mixed states, we can compute a genuine multiparty entanglement measure, the generalized geometric measure for these classes of mixed states. The chosen states have different ranks and consist of an arbitrary number of parties.

abstract: Motivated by the Dirac idea that fundamental constant are dynamical variables and by conjectures on quantum structure of spacetime at small distances, we consider the possibility that Planck constant $\hbar$ is a time depending quantity, undergoing random gaussian fluctuations around its measured constant mean value, and with a typical correlation timescale $\tau$. We consider the case of propagation of a free particle and a one--dimensional harmonic oscillator coherent state, and show that the time evolution in both cases is different from the standard behaviour. Finally, we discuss how interferometric experiments or exploiting coherent electromagnetic fields in a cavity may put effective bounds on the value of $\tau$.

abstract: We explore theoretically the physics of dynamic hysteresis for driven-dissipative nonlinear photon resonators. In the regime where the semiclassical mean-field theory predicts bistability, the exact steady-state density matrix is known to be unique, being a statistical mixture of two states: in particular, no static hysteresis cycle of the excited population occurs as a function of the driving intensity. Here, we predict that in the quantum regime a {\it dynamic} hysteresis with a rich phenomenology does appear when sweeping the driving amplitude in a finite time. The hysteresis area as a function of the sweep time reveals a power-law decay with an universal exponent, with a behavior qualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. The dynamic hysteresis power-law defines a characteristic time, which depends dramatically on the size of the nonlinearity and on the frequency detuning between the driving and the resonator. In the strong nonlinearity regime, the characteristic time oscillates as a function of the intrinsic system parameters due to multiphotonic resonances. We also consider the case of two coupled driven-dissipative nonlinear resonators, showing that dynamic hysteresis and power-law behavior occur also in presence of correlations between the resonators. Our theoretical predictions can be explored in a broad variety of physical systems, e.g., circuit QED superconducting resonators and semiconductor optical microcavities.

abstract: The implementation of optimal statistical inference protocols for high-dimensional quantum systems is often computationally expensive. To avoid the difficulties associated with optimal techniques, here I propose an alternative approach to quantum estimation and detection based on Volterra filters. Volterra filters have a clear hierarchy of computational complexities and performances, depend only on finite-order correlation functions, and are applicable to systems with no simple Markovian model. These features make Volterra filters appealing alternatives to optimal nonlinear protocols for the estimation and control of complex quantum systems.

abstract: A general theory of preparational uncertainty relations for a quantum particle in one spatial dimension is developed. We derive conditions which determine whether a given smooth function of the particle's variances and its covariance is bounded from below. Whenever a global minimum exists, an uncertainty relation has been obtained. The squeezed number states of a harmonic oscillator are found to be universal: no other pure or mixed states will saturate any such relation. Geometrically, we identify a convex uncertainty region in the space of second moments which is bounded by the inequality derived by Robertson and Schr\"{o}dinger. Our approach not only unifies existing uncertainty relations but also leads to new inequalities for second moments.

abstract: The Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect for massive particles is theoretically analysed using quantum wave-packets, to provide a better understanding of its quantum interpretation. The effect is demonstrated for two independent particles governed by Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac statistics. The HBT effect is also analysed for pairs of entangled particles. Surprisingly, entanglement has almost no effect on the interference seen in the HBT effect. In the light of the results, an old quantum optics experiment is reanalysed, and it is argued that the interference seen in that experiment is not a consequence of non-local correlations between the photons, as is commonly believed.

abstract: This paper is concerned with coherent quantum control design for translation invariant networks of identical quantum stochastic systems subjected to external quantum noise. The network is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator and is governed by a set of linear quantum stochastic differential equations. The dynamic variables of this quantum plant satisfy the canonical commutation relations. Similar large-scale systems can be found, for example, in quantum metamaterials and optical lattices. The problem under consideration is to design a stabilizing decentralized coherent quantum controller in the form of another translation invariant quantum system, directly coupled to the plant, so as to minimize a weighted mean square functional of the dynamic variables of the interconnected networks. We consider this problem in the thermodynamic limit of infinite network size and present first-order necessary conditions for optimality of the controller.

abstract: We probe small scalar coupling differences via the coherent interactions between two nuclear spin singlet states in organic molecules. We show that the spin-lock induced crossing (SLIC) technique enables the coherent transfer of singlet order between one spin pair and another. The transfer is mediated by the difference in cis and trans vicinal J couplings among the spins. By measuring the transfer rate, we calculate a J coupling difference of $8 \pm 2$ mHz in phenylalanine-glycine-glycine and $2.57 \pm 0.04$ Hz in glutamate. We also characterize a coherence between two singlet states in glutamate, which may enable the creation of a long-lived quantum memory.

abstract: In common sense, postselected weak amplification must be related to destructive interference effect of the meter system, and a single photon exerts no effect on thermal field via cross-phasemodulation (XPM) interaction. In this Letter we present, for the first time, a thermal light cross-Kerr effect. Through analysis, we reveal two unexpected results: i) postselection and weak amplification can be explained at a classical level without destructive interference, and ii) weak amplification and weak value are not one thing. After postselection a new mixed light can be generated which is nonclassical. This scheme can be realized via electromagnetically-induced transparency.

abstract: We consider the many-body spectra of interacting bosonic quantum fields on a lattice in the semiclassical limit of large particle number $N$. We show that the many-body density of states can be expressed as a coherent sum over oscillating long-wavelength contributions given by periodic, non-perturbative solutions of the, typically non-linear, wave equation of the classical (mean-field) limit. To this end we construct the semiclassical approximation for both the smooth and oscillatory part of the many-body density of states in terms of a trace formula starting from the exact path integral form of the propagator between many-body quadrature states. We therefore avoid the use of a complexified classical limit characteristic of the coherent state representation. While quantum effects like vacuum fluctuations and gauge invariance are exactly accounted for, our semiclassical approach captures quantum interference and therefore is valid well beyond the Ehrenfest time where naive quantum-classical correspondence breaks down. Remarkably, due to a special feature of harmonic systems with incommensurable frequencies, our formulas are valid also in the free field case of non-interacting bosons.

The proposed Lagrangian is written in terms of the local superposition of the particle fields with the applied electromagnetic fields, not in terms of the particle charge and of the electromagnetic potentials as is usual. The total Lagrangian for a set of charged particles assumes a simple elegant form with the alternative formulation, giving an aesthetic support for it. The proposed Lagrangian is equivalent to the traditional one in their domain of validity and provides an interesting description of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

abstract: We describe a general method to obtain quantum speedups of classical algorithms which are based on the technique of backtracking, a standard approach for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Backtracking algorithms explore a tree whose vertices are partial solutions to a CSP in an attempt to find a complete solution. Assume there is a classical backtracking algorithm which finds a solution to a CSP on n variables, or outputs that none exists, and whose corresponding tree contains T vertices, each vertex corresponding to a test of a partial solution. Then we show that there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm which completes the same task using O(sqrt(T) n^(3/2) log n) tests. In particular, this quantum algorithm can be used to speed up the DPLL algorithm, which is the basis of many of the most efficient SAT solvers used in practice. The quantum algorithm is based on the use of a quantum walk algorithm of Belovs to search in the backtracking tree. We also discuss how, for certain distributions on the inputs, the algorithm can lead to an average-case exponential speedup.

Our method is based on a Poissonian unraveling of the master equation whose deterministic part exhibits soliton-like solutions that can be identified with the pointer states. In the semiclassical limit, their phase space trajectories turn into those of classical diffusion, yielding a clear picture of the induced quantum- classical transition.

abstract: We consider a thought experiment where the preparation of a macroscopically massive or charged particle in a quantum superposition and the associated dynamics of a distant test particle apparently allow for superluminal communication. We give a solution to the paradox which is based on the following fundamental principle: any local experiment, discriminating a coherent superposition from an incoherent statistical mixture, necessarily requires a minimum time proportional to the mass (or charge) of the system. For a charged particle, we consider two examples of such experiments, and show that they are both consistent with the previous limitation. In the first, the measurement requires to accelerate the charge, that can entangle with the emitted photons. In the second, the limitation can be ascribed to the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. On the other hand, when applied to massive particles our result provides an indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational vacuum fluctuations and for the possibility of entangling a particle with quantum gravitational radiation.

abstract: We devise a phase-coherent three-pulse protocol to probe the polariton dynamics in a trapped-ion quantum simulation. In contrast to conventional nonlinear signals, the presented scheme does not change the number of excitations in the system, allowing for the investigation of the dynamics within an $N$-excitation manifold. In the particular case of a filling factor one ($N$ excitations in an $N$-ion chain), the proposed interaction induces coherent transitions between a delocalized phonon superfluid and a localized atomic insulator phase. Numerical simulations of a two-ion chain demonstrate that the resulting two-dimensional spectra allow for the unambiguous identification of the distinct phases, and the two-dimensional lineshapes efficiently characterize the relevant decoherence mechanism.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02442
abstract: A Lagrangian formulation is constructed for particle interpretations of quantum mechanics, a well-known example of such an interpretation being the Bohm model. The advantages of such a description are that the equations for particle motion, field evolution and conservation laws can all be deduced from a single Lagrangian density expression. The formalism presented is Lorentz invariant. This paper follows on from a previous one which was limited to the single-particle case. The present paper treats the more general case of many particles in an entangled state. It is found that describing more than one particle while maintaining a relativistic description requires the introduction of final boundary conditions as well as initial, thereby entailing retrocausality.

One defines geometric contextuality from the discrepancy between the commutativity of cosets on $\mathcal{G}$ and that of quantum observables.It is shown in this paper that Kleinian subgroups $K=\left\langle f,g\right\rangle$ that are non-compact, arithmetic, and generated by two elliptic isometries $f$ and $g$ (the Martin-Maclachlan classification), are appropriate contextuality filters. Standard contextual geometries such as some thin generalized polygons (starting with Mermin's $3 \times 3$ grid) belong to this frame. The Bianchi groups $PSL(2,O\_d)$, $d \in \{1,3\}$ defined over the imaginary quadratic field $O\_d=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ play a special role.

abstract: We derive steerability criteria applicable for both finite and infinite dimensional quantum systems using covariance matrices of local observables. We show that these criteria are useful to detect a wide range of entangled states particularly in high dimensional systems and that the Gaussian steering criteria for general M x N-modes of continuous variables are obtained as a special case. Extending from the approach of entanglement detection via covariance matrices, our criteria are based on the local uncertainty principles incorporating the asymmetric nature of steering scenario. Specifically, we apply the formulation to the case of local orthogonal observables and obtain some useful criteria that can be straightforwardly computable, and testable in experiment, with no need for numerical optimization.

abstract: Entanglement lies at the heart of quantum mechanics $-$ as a fundamental tool for testing its deep rift with classical physics, while also providing a key resource for quantum technologies such as quantum computation and cryptography. In 1987 Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger realized that the entanglement of more than two particles implies a non-statistical conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics. The resulting predictions were experimentally confirmed by entangling three photons in their polarization. Experimental efforts since have singularly focused on increasing the number of particles entangled, while remaining in a two-dimensional space for each particle. Here we show the experimental generation of the first multi-photon entangled state where both $-$ the number of particles and the number of dimensions $-$ are greater than two. Interestingly, our state exhibits an asymmetric entanglement structure that is only possible when one considers multi-particle entangled states in high dimensions. Two photons in our state reside in a three-dimensional space, while the third lives in two dimensions. Our method relies on combining two pairs of photons, high-dimensionally entangled in their orbital angular momentum, in such a way that information about their origin is erased. Additionally, we show how this state enables a new type of "layered" quantum cryptographic protocol where two parties share an additional layer of secure information over that already shared by all three parties. In addition to their application in novel quantum communication protocols, such asymmetric entangled states serve as a manifestation of the complex dance of correlations that can exist within quantum mechanics.

abstract: We explore to what extent path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods can efficiently simulate the tunneling behavior of quantum adiabatic optimization algorithms. Specifically we look at symmetric cost functions defined over n bits with a single potential barrier that a successful optimization algorithm will have to tunnel through. The height and width of this barrier depend on n, and by tuning these dependencies, we can make the optimization algorithm succeed or fail in polynomial time. In this article we compare the strength of quantum adiabatic tunneling with that of path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods. We find numerical evidence that quantum Monte Carlo algorithms will succeed in the same regimes where quantum adiabatic optimization succeeds.

abstract: We present a time-dependent calculation of the velocity-dependent van der Waals force which acts on an excited atom in relative motion with respect to ground state atoms of a different kind. Both, its interaction with a single atom and with a dilute atomic plate are evaluated. We find that, at leading order, these interactions are linear in the velocity. Whereas the associated forces are antiparallel to the velocity in the nonretarded regime, they oscillate in space in the retarded regime. These forces correspond to the velocity-dependent recoil experienced by the excited atom in the processes of absorption and emission of the photons that it exchanges with the ground state atoms on a periodic basis.

abstract: Using the adaptive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method, we numerically investigate the expansion dynamics of bosons in a one-dimensional hard-core boson model with three-body interactions. It is found that the bosons expand ballistically with weak interaction, which are obtained by local density and the radius $R_n$. It is shown that the expansion velocity $V$, obtained from $R_n=Vt$, is dependent on the number of bosons. As a prominent result, the expansion velocity decreases with the enhancement of three-body interaction. We further study the dynamics of the system, which quenches from the ground state with two-thirds filling, the results indicate the expansion is also ballistic in the gapless phase regime. It could help us detect the phase transition in the system.

abstract: We study the strong coupling between photons and atoms that can be achieved in an optical nanofiber geometry when the interaction is dispersive. While the Purcell enhancement factor for spontaneous emission into the guided mode does not reach the strong-coupling regime for individual atoms, one can obtain high cooperativity for ensembles of a few thousand atoms due to the tight confinement of the guided modes and constructive interference over the entire chain of trapped atoms. We calculate the dyadic Green's function, which determines the scattering of light by atoms in the presence of the fiber, and thus the phase shift and polarization rotation induced on the guided light by the trapped atoms. The Green's function is related to a full Heisenberg-Langevin treatment of the dispersive response of the quantized field to tensor polarizable atoms. We apply our formalism to quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the atoms via polarimetry. We study shot-noise-limited detection of atom number for atoms in a completely mixed spin state and the squeezing of projection noise for atoms in clock states. Compared with squeezing of atomic ensembles in free space, we capitalize on unique features that arise in the nanofiber geometry including anisotropy of both the intensity and polarization of the guided modes. We use a first principles stochastic master equation to model the squeezing as function of time in the presence of decoherence due to optical pumping. We find a peak metrological squeezing of ~5 dB is achievable with current technology for ~2500 atoms trapped 180 nm from the surface of a nanofiber with radius a=225 nm.

abstract: Many physical systems of interest that are encountered in practice are input-output open quantum systems described by quantum stochastic differential equations and defined on an infinite-dimensional underlying Hilbert space. Most commonly, these systems involve coupling to a quantum harmonic oscillator as a system component. This paper is concerned with the error in the finite-dimensional approximation of input-output open quantum systems defined on an infinite-dimensional underlying Hilbert space. We present explicit error bounds between the time evolution of the state of a class of infinite-dimensional quantum systems and its approximation on a finite-dimensional subspace of the original, when both are initialized in the latter subspace. Applications to some physical examples drawn from the literature are provided to illustrate our results.

abstract: In this work we proof that boson sampling with $N$ particles in $M$ modes is equivalent to short-time evolution with $N$ excitations in an XY model of $2N$ spins. This mapping is efficient whenever the boson bunching probability is small, and errors can be efficiently postselected. This mapping opens the door to boson sampling with quantum simulators or general purpose quantum computers, and highlights the complexity of time-evolution with critical spin models, even for very short times.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.02721
abstract: We study the biased version of the \emph{causal inseparable} game introduced in [Nat. Commun. {\bf3}, 1092 (2012)]. Two separated parties, Alice and Bob, generate biased bits (say input bit) in their respective local laboratories. Bob generates another biased bit (say decision bit) which determines their goal: whether Alice has to guess Bob's bit or vice-verse. Under the assumption that events are ordered with respect to some global causal relation, we show that the success probability of this biased causal game is upper bounded, giving rise to \emph{biased causal inequality} (BCI). However there exist valid \emph{inseparable} process matrices that violate the BCI for arbitrary bias in the decision bit. We provide a \emph{causal witness} that can detect the causal inseparability of these process matrices. We also derive the maximal violation of the BCI under local operations involving traceless binary observables. However for biased input bit we find that there is a threshold bias beyond which no valid qubit process matrix can violate the causal inequality under \emph{measurement-repreparation} type operation.

This effect is obtained by parametric modulation of the optical spring in a cavity opto-mechanical system. In addition to stationary variance measurements, we describe the dynamic behavior in the regime of pulsed parametric excitation, showing enhanced squeezing effect surpassing the stationary 3dB limit. While the present experiment is in the classical regime, our technique can be exploited to produce entangled, macroscopic quantum opto-mechanical modes.

abstract: The G\"oppert-Mayer (GM) gauge transformation, of central importance in atomic, molecular, and optical physics since it connects the length gauge and the velocity gauge, becomes unphysical as the field frequency declines towards zero. This is not consequential for theories of transverse fields, but it is the underlying reason for the failure of gauge invariance in the dipole-approximation version of the Strong-Field Approximation (SFA). This failure of the GM gauge transformation explains why the length gauge is preferred in analytical approximation methods for fields that possess a constant electric field as a zero-frequency limit.

abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts a number of at first sight counterintuitive phenomena. It is therefore a question whether our intuition is the best way to find new experiments. Here we report the development of the computer algorithm Melvin which is able to find new experimental implementations for the creation and manipulation of complex quantum states. And indeed, the discovered experiments extensively use unfamiliar and asymmetric techniques which are challenging to understand intuitively. The results range from the first implementation of a high-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, to a vast variety of experiments for asymmetrically entangled quantum states - a feature that can only exist when both the number of involved parties and dimensions is larger than 2. Additionally, new types of high-dimensional transformations are found that perform cyclic operations. Melvin autonomously learns from solutions for simpler systems, which significantly speeds up the discovery rate of more complex experiments. The ability to automate the design of a quantum experiment can be applied to many quantum systems and allows the physical realization of quantum states previously thought of only on paper.

abstract: A propagator for the one dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with an asymmetric rectangular potential is obtained using the multiple-scattering theory approach. It allows for the consideration of the reflection and transmission processes as the particle scattering at the potential jump (in contrast to the conventional wave-like picture) and for accounting for the nonclassical counterintuitive contribution of the backward-moving component of the wave packet attributed to the particle. This propagator completely resolves the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (defines the wave function ${\psi}(x,t)$) and allows for considering the quantum mechanical effects of a particle reflection from the potential downward step/well and a particle tunneling through the potential barrier as a function of time. These results are related to fundamental issues such as measuring time in quantum mechanics (tunneling time, time of arrival, dwell time). For imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature $(t\rightarrow-i{\hbar}/k_{B}T)$, the obtained propagator is equivalent to the density matrix for a particle that is in a heat bath and is subject to a rectangular potential. If one shifts to imaginary time $(t\rightarrow-it)$, the matrix element of the calculated propagator in the spatial basis provides a solution to the diffusion-like equation with a rectangular potential. The obtained exact results are presented as the integrals from elementary functions and thus allow for a numerical visualization of the probability density $|\psi(x,t)|^2$, the density matrix and the solution of the diffusion-like equation. The results obtained may also be useful for spintronics applications due to the fact that the asymmetric (spin-dependent) rectangular potential can model the potential profile in layered magnetic nanostructures.

abstract: Quantum error correction will be a necessary component towards realizing scalable quantum computers with physical qubits. Theoretically, it is possible to perform arbitrarily long computations if the error rate is below a threshold value. The two-dimensional surface code permits relatively high fault-tolerant thresholds at the ~1% level, and only requires a latticed network of qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. Superconducting qubits have continued to steadily improve in coherence, gate, and readout fidelities, to become a leading candidate for implementation into larger quantum networks. Here we describe characterization experiments and calibration of a system of four superconducting qubits arranged in a planar lattice, amenable to the surface code. Insights into the particular qubit design and comparison between simulated parameters and experimentally determined parameters are given. Single- and two-qubit gate tune-up procedures are described and results for simultaneously benchmarking pairs of two-qubit gates are given. All controls are eventually used for an arbitrary error detection protocol described in separate work [Corcoles et al., Nature Communications, 6, 2015]

abstract: We study the influence of photons on the dynamics and the ground state of the atoms in a Bosonic Josephson junction inside an optical resonator. The system is engineered in such a way that the atomic tunneling can be tuned by changing the number of photons in the cavity. In this setup the cavity photons are a new means of control, which can be utilized both in inducing self-trapping solutions and in driving the crossover of the ground state from an atomic coherent state to a Schr\"odinger's cat state. This is achieved, for suitable setup configurations, with interatomic interactions weaker than those required in the absence of cavity. This is corroborated by the study of the entanglement entropy. In the presence of a laser, this quantum indicator attains its maximum value (which marks the formation of the cat-like state and, at a semiclassical level, the onset of self-trapping) for attractions smaller than those of the bare junction.

abstract: We propose a deterministic scheme for teleporting an unknown qubit through continuous-variable entangled states in superconducting circuits. The qubit is a superconducting two-level system and the bipartite quantum channel is a photonic entangled coherent state between two cavities. A Bell-type measurement performed on the hybrid state of solid and photonic states brings a discrete-variable unknown electronic state to a continuous-variable photonic cat state in a cavity mode. This scheme further enables applications for quantum information processing in the same architecture of circuit-QED such as verification and error-detection schemes for entangled coherent states. Finally, a dynamical method of a self-Kerr tunability in a cavity state has been investigated for minimizing self-Kerr distortion and all essential ingredients are shown to be experimentally feasible with the state of the art superconducting circuits.

abstract: The power of optical holography stems from its ability to reveal complete, phase-amplitude spatial information about detected light. Standard holographic methods require a well-defined phase relation between measured and reference beams that is fundamentally impossible to fulfill for a single photon due to its entirely indeterminate global phase. We introduce a method to create a hologram of a single photon (HSP) probed by a reference photon, based on an essentially different concept of quantum interference between two-photon probability amplitudes. Similarly to classical holograms, HSP encodes full information about photon's "shape", i.e. its quantum wavefunction whose local amplitude and phase are retrieved in the presented experiment. The HSP technique can be applied also to measure wavefunctions of other bosons, such as integer spin atoms.

abstract: Electron-positron pair production by the superposition of two laser pulses with different frequencies and amplitudes is analyzed as a particular realization of the assisted dynamic Schwinger effect. It is demonstrated that, within a non-perturbative kinetic equation framework, an amplification effect is conceivable for certain parameters. When both pulses have wavelengths longer than the Compton wavelength, the residual net density of produced pairs is determined by the resultant field strength. The number of pairs starts to grow rapidly if the wavelength of the high-frequency laser component gets close to the Compton wavelength.

abstract: Quantum gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a promising method for the full characterization of quantum logic gates. In contrast to quantum process tomography (QPT), GST self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than QPT as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of GST and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of GST as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of GST and QPT using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by QPT near quantum error correction thresholds, while GST is accurate in this regime.

abstract: Strongly unforgeable signature schemes provide a more stringent security guarantee than the standard existential unforgeability. It requires that not only forging a signature on a new message is hard, it is infeasible as well to produce a new signature on a message for which the adversary has seen valid signatures before. Strongly unforgeable signatures are useful both in practice and as a building block in many cryptographic constructions. This work investigates a generic transformation that compiles any existential-unforgeable scheme into a strongly unforgeable one, which was proposed by Teranishi et al. and was proven in the classical random-oracle model. Our main contribution is showing that the transformation also works against quantum adversaries in the quantum random-oracle model. We develop proof techniques such as adaptively programming a quantum random-oracle in a new setting, which could be of independent interest. Applying the transformation to an existential-unforgeable signature scheme due to Cash et al., which can be shown to be quantum-secure assuming certain lattice problems are hard for quantum computers, we get an efficient quantum-secure strongly unforgeable signature scheme in the quantum random-oracle model.

abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation is a model for quantum information processing utilizing local measurements on suitably entangled resource states for the implementation of quantum gates. A complete characterization for universal resource states is still missing. It has been shown that symmetry-protected topological order in one dimension can be exploited for the protection of certain quantum gates in measurement-based quantum computation. In this paper we show that the two-dimensional plaquette states on arbitrary lattices exhibit nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order in terms of symmetry fractionalization and that they are universal resource states for quantum computation. Our results of the nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order on arbitrary 2D lattices are based on an extension of the recent construction by Chen, Gu, Liu and Wen {[Phys. Rev. B \textbf{87}, 155114 (2013)]} on the square lattice.

We illustrate how this approach works in the one dimensional quantum Ising model in the transverse field. Several closed-form analytical expressions for fidelity are discussed. An example of what insights fidelity provides into the dynamics of quantum phase transitions is carefully described. The role of fidelity in central spin systems is pointed out.

We then determine the Casimir--Polder potential of an atom with the grating. In particular, we find that strong anisotropy can lead to a repulsive Casimir--Polder potential in the normal direction.

The environment consists of a large number of independent non-interacting and non-interfering elementary quantum systems - qubits. The qubits travelling through the channel can only be randomly replaced by environmental qubits. We investigate a conditional cooling limit that exploits an additional probing output. The limit specifies when the single-qubit channel is quantum, i.e. it preserves entanglement. It is a fundamental condition for entanglement-based quantum technology.

abstract: We demonstrate a solid state spin-wave optical memory based on stopped light in a spectral hole. A long lived narrow spectral hole is created by optical pumping in the inhomogeneous absorption profile of a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal. Optical pulses sent through the spectral hole experience a strong reduction of their group velocity and are spatially compressed in the crystal. A short Raman pulse transfers the optical excitation to the spin state before the light pulse exits the crystal, effectively stopping the light. After a controllable delay, a second Raman pulse is sent, which leads to the emission of the stored photons. We reach storage and retrieval efficiencies for bright pulses of up to $39\,\%$ in a $5 \,\mathrm{mm}$-long crystal. We also show that our device works at the single photon level by storing and retrieving $3\,\mathrm{\mu s}$-long weak coherent pulses with efficiencies up to $31\,\%$, demonstrating the most efficient spin-wave solid state optical memory at the single-photon level so far. We reach an unconditional noise level of $(9\pm1)\times 10^{-3}$ photons per pulse in a detection window of $4\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ leading to a signal-to-noise ratio of $33 \pm 4$ for an average input photon number of 1, making our device promising for long-lived storage of non-classical light.

abstract: The generation and storage of entangled photons play important roles in quantum information technique. Spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) in atomic ensembles provides a promising method to generate entangled photons capable of storage. In the past experiments, a spin-wave-photon entangled state is produced via SRS in an atomic ensemble, with which a pair of entangled photons is obtained. Here, we report a scheme of simultaneously generating two spin-wave-photon entangled states in an atomic ensemble by collecting Stokes photons at two different directions. Based on the obtained two atom-photon entangled sources, we generate a three-photon GHZ polarization-entangled state and conditionally prepare a polarization-entangled photon pair, respectively.

abstract: We investigate spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in a single-channel side-coupled integrated spaced sequence of resonators (SCISSOR). Analytic expressions for the number of photon pairs generated, as well as the biphoton wave function (joint spectral amplitude) describing the pairs, are derived and numerically computed for different pump pulse durations and numbers of ring resonators. In the limit of a long input pump pulse, we show a strong analogy between super-linear scaling of generation efficiency with respect to the number of rings in the structure and Dicke superradiance. More generally, we discuss in detail the factors that influence the shape of the biphoton wave function, as well as the conditions for observing super-SFWM.

abstract: This paper considers quantum communication involving an ensemble of states. Apart from the von Neumann entropy, it considers other measures one of which may be useful in obtaining information about an unknown pure state and another that may be useful in quantum games. It is shown that under certain conditions in a two-party quantum game, the receiver of the states can increase the entropy by adding another pure state.

abstract: Entropic Dynamics is a framework in which dynamical laws are derived as an application of entropic methods of inference. No underlying action principle is postulated. Instead, the dynamics is driven by entropy subject to the constraints appropriate to the problem at hand. In this paper we review three examples of entropic dynamics. First we tackle the simpler case of a standard diffusion process which allows us to address the central issue of the nature of time. Then we show that imposing the additional constraint that the dynamics be non-dissipative leads to Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, considerations from information geometry naturally lead to the type of Hamiltonian that describes quantum theory.

abstract: We show how to perform a fault-tolerant universal quantum computation in 2D architectures using only transversal unitary operators and local syndrome measurements. Our approach is based on a doubled version of the 2D color code. It enables a transversal implementation of all logical gates in the Clifford+T basis using the gauge fixing method proposed recently by Paetznick and Reichardt. The gauge fixing requires six-qubit parity measurements for Pauli operators supported on faces of the honeycomb lattice with two qubits per site. Doubled color codes are promising candidates for the experimental demonstration of logical gates since they do not require state distillation. Secondly, we propose a Maximum Likelihood algorithm for the error correction and gauge fixing tasks that enables a numerical simulation of logical circuits in the Clifford+T basis. The algorithm can be used in the online regime such that a new error syndrome is revealed at each time step. We estimate the average number of logical gates that can be implemented reliably for the smallest doubled color code and a toy noise model that includes depolarizing memory errors and syndrome measurement errors.

abstract: Information-theoretical quantities such as statistical distinguishability typically result from optimisations over all conceivable observables. Physical theories, however, are not generally considered valid for all mathematically allowed measurements. For instance, quantum field theories are not meant to be correct or even consistent at arbitrarily small lengthscales. A general way of limiting such an optimisation to certain observables is to first coarse-grain the states by a quantum channel. We show how to calculate contractive quantum information metrics on coarse-grained equilibrium states of free bosonic systems (Gaussian states), in directions generated by arbitrary perturbations of the Hamiltonian. As an example, we study the Klein-Gordon field. If the phase-space resolution is coarse compared to h-bar, the various metrics become equal and the calculations simplify. In that context, we compute the scale dependence of the distinguishability of the quartic interaction.

abstract: We examine the locality assumption of Bell's theorem in three steps of EPRB experiment. Depending on the context, locality is embodied in the conditions of separability, local causality, factorizability, relativistic causality, and non-contextuality. We show that separability, characterized by the constraint of zero covariance, is equivalent to local causality which leads to factorizability through the measurement process. Factorizability is the conjunction of parameter independence and outcome independence. It is commonly believed that relativistic causality is equivalent to parameter independence, which is satisfied by quantum mechanics. According to our approach, however, this is unjustified due to the second step analysis of EPRB experiment, including the measurement on the first particle. We define non-contextuality based on preparation procedure and measurement process. Preparation-based non-contextuality is an independent assumption, but non-locality within the framework of a separable model can be interpreted as measurement-based contextuality. Finally, we show that any fundamental theory consistent with quantum mechanics, should refute outcome independence in its framework of description.

abstract: We propose an experimentally accessible scheme to determine lower bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which ascertains multipartite entanglement or usefulness for quantum metrology. The scheme is based on comparing the measurement statistics of a state before and after a small unitary rotation. We argue that, in general, limited resolution of collective observables prevents the detection of large QFI. This can be overcome by performing an additional operation prior to the measurement. We illustrate the power of this protocol for present-day spin-squeezing experiments, where the same operation used for the preparation of the initial spin-squeezed state improves the lower bound on the QFI by two orders of magnitude. We also establish a connection to Leggett-Garg inequalities. We show how to simulate a variant of the inequalities with our protocol and demonstrate that a large QFI is necessary for their violation with coarse-grained detectors.

abstract: We propose a quantitative criterion to determine whether the coupled quantum systems can achieve complete synchronization or phase synchronization in the process of analyzing quantum synchronization. Adopting the criterion, we discuss the quantum synchronization effects between optomechanical systems and find that the error between the systems and the fluctuation of error are sensitive to coupling intensity by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent of the model and quantum fluctuation, respectively. Through taking the appropriate coupling intensity, we can control quantum synchronization even under different logical relationship between switches. Finally, we simulate the dynamical evolution of the system to verify the quantum synchronization criterion and to show the ability of synchronization control.

abstract: Atomic-scale logic and the minimization of heating (dissipation) are both very high on the agenda for future computation hardware. An approach to achieve these would be to replace networks of transistors directly by classical reversible logic gates built from the coherent dynamics of a few interacting atoms. As superpositions are unnecessary before and after each such gate (inputs and outputs are bits), the dephasing time only needs to exceed a single gate operation time, while fault tolerance should be achieved with low overhead, by classical coding. Such gates could thus be a spin-off of quantum technology much before full-scale quantum computation. Thus motivated, we propose methods to realize the 3-bit Toffoli and Fredkin gates universal for classical reversible logic using a single time-independent 3-qubit Hamiltonian with realistic nearest neighbour two-body interactions. We also exemplify how these gates can be composed to make a larger circuit. We show that trapped ions may soon be scalable simulators for such architectures, and investigate the prospects with dopants in silicon.

abstract: We propose an implementation of a universal quantum gate between pairs of spatially separated atoms in a microwave cavity at finite temperature. The gate results from reversible laser excitation of Rydberg states of atoms interacting with each other via exchange of virtual photons through a common cavity mode. Quantum interference of different transition paths between the two-atom ground and double-excited Rydberg states makes both the transition amplitude and resonance largely insensitive to the excitations in the microwave cavity "quantum bus" which can therefore be in any superposition or mixture of photon number states. Our scheme for attaining ultralong-range interactions and entanglement also applies to mesoscopic atomic ensembles in the Rydberg blockade regime and is scalable to many ensembles trapped within a centimeter sized microwave resonator.

abstract: In non-relativistic Bohmian mechanics the universe is represented by a probability space whose sample space is composed of the Bohmian trajectories. In relativistic Bohmian mechanics an entire class of empirically equivalent probability spaces can be defined, one for every foliation of spacetime. In the literature the hypothesis has been advanced that a single preferred foliation is allowed, and that this foliation derives from the universal wave function by means of a covariant law. In the present paper the opposite hypothesis is advanced, i.e., no law exists for the foliations and therefore all the foliations are allowed. The resulting model of the universe is basically the "union" of all the probability spaces associated with the foliations. This hypothesis is mainly motivated by the fact that any law defining a preferred foliation is empirically irrelevant. It is also argued that the absence of a preferred foliation may reduce the well known conflict between Bohmian mechanics and Relativity.

One can also consistently suppose predictions and probabilities which are neither classical nor quantum, but which are subject to subclassicality; that is, the additivity of probability for mutually exclusive, co-measurable observables, as formalized by admissibility rules and frame functions.

abstract: Optical access networks connect multiple endpoints to a common network node via shared fibre infrastructure. They will play a vital role to scale up the number of users in quantum key distribution (QKD) networks. However, the presence of power splitters in the commonly used passive network architecture makes successful transmission of weak quantum signals challenging. This is especially true if QKD and data signals are multiplexed in the passive network. The splitter introduces an imbalance between quantum signal and Raman noise, which can prevent the recovery of the quantum signal completely. Here we introduce a method to overcome this limitation and demonstrate coexistence of multi-user QKD and full power data traffic from a gigabit passive optical network (GPON). The dual feeder implementation is compatible with standard GPON architectures and can support up to 128 users, highlighting that quantum protected GPON networks could be commonplace in the future.

abstract: A long-lived and multimode quantum memory is a key component needed for the development of quantum communication. Here we present temporally multiplexed storage of 5 photonic polarization qubits encoded onto weak coherent states in a rare-earth-ion doped crystal. Using spin refocusing techniques we can preserve the qubits for more than half a millisecond. The temporal multiplexing allows us to increase the effective rate of the experiment by a factor of 5, which emphasizes the importance of multimode storage for quantum communication. The fidelity upon retrieval is higher than the maximum classical fidelity achievable with qubits encoded onto single photons and we show that the memory fidelity is mainly limited by the memory signal-to-noise ratio. These results show the viability and versatility of long-lived, multimode quantum memories based on rare-earth-ion doped crystals.

Different from other quantumness-oriented method, e.g. quantum entanglement et al., the coherence susceptibility method has no trouble of delicately choosing system bipartition. The influence of thermal fluctuation at finite temperatures is also discussed. The coherence susceptibility method performs well for identifying different types of quantum phase transition points even at finite temperature.

abstract: We consider a central system which is coupled via dephasing to an open system, i.e. an intermediate system which in turn is coupled to another environment. Considering intermediate and far environment as one composite system, the coherences in the central system are given in the form of fidelity amplitudes for a certain perturbed echo dynamics in the composite environment. On the basis of the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a master equation for the reduction of that dynamics to the intermediate system alone. In distinction to an earlier paper [arXiv: 1502.04143 (2015)] where we discussed the stabilizing effect of the far environment on the decoherence in the central system, we focus here on the possibility to use the measurable coherences in the central system for probing the open quantum dynamics in the intermediate system. We illustrate our results for the case of chaotic dynamics in the near environment, where we compare random matrix simulations with our analytical result.

abstract: We investigate a possibility to generate non-classical states in light-matter coupled noisy quantum systems - the Rabi and Dicke models. In these hybrid quantum systems a competing influence of coherent internal dynamics and environment induced dissipation drives the system into non-equilibrium steady states. Explicitly, for the Rabi model the steady state is given by an incoherent mixture of two states of opposite parities, but as each parity state displays light-matter entanglement we also find that the full state is entangled. Furthermore, we also propose to combine an all-optical feedback strategy for quantum state protection and for establishing quantum control in these systems. Our present work further elucidates the relevance of such hybrid open quantum systems for potential applications in quantum architectures.

abstract: The interpretation of quantum theory is one of the longest-standing debates in physics. Type-I interpretations see quantum probabilities as determined by intrinsic properties of the world. Type-II interpretations see quantum probabilities as not directly dealing with intrinsic properties of the world but with relational experiences between an observer and the world. It is usually believed that deciding between these two types cannot be made simply on purely physical grounds but it requires an act of metaphysical judgement. Here we show that, although the problem is undecidable within the framework of quantum theory, it is decidable, under some assumptions, within the framework of thermodynamics. We prove that type-I interpretations are incompatible with the following assumptions: (i) the decision of which measurement is performed on a quantum system can be made independently of the system, (ii) a quantum system has limited memory, and (iii) Landauer's principle is valid. We consider an ideal experiment in which an individual quantum system is submitted to a sequence of quantum projective measurements that leave the system in pure quantum states. We show that in any type-I interpretation satisfying (i)-(iii) the system must reset its internal state, which implies that a minimum amount of heat per measurement has to be dissipated into the system's environment. We calculate a lower bound to the heat dissipated per measurement assuming that the measurements are chosen from a set of size $2^n$. Then, we show that this lower bound becomes infinite in the limit of $n$ tending to infinity. This leads to the conclusion that either type-I interpretations are untenable or at least one of the assumptions (i)-(iii) has to be abandoned.

We also propose a new complex extension of P-transformation and T-transformation (the `parity' and `time reflection' respectively). Particularly, the P-transformation realizes the left-right reflection in the complex plane.

abstract: In this article we present a concrete proposal for spin squeezing the ultracold ground state polar paramagnetic molecule OH, a system currently under fine control in the laboratory. In contrast to existing work, we consider a single, non-interacting molecule with angular momentum greater than $1/2$. Starting from an experimentally relevant effective Hamiltonian, we identify a parameter regime where different combinations of static electric and magnetic fields can be used to realize the single-axis twisting Hamiltonian of Kitagawa and Ueda [M. Kitagawa and M. Ueda, Phys. Rev. A 47, 5138 (1993)], the uniform field Hamiltonian proposed by Law et al. [C. K. Law, H. T Ng and P. T. Leung, Phys. Rev. A 63, 055601 (2001)], and a model of field propagation in a Kerr medium considered by Agarwal and Puri [G. S. Agarwal and R. R. Puri, Phys. Rev. A 39, 2969 (1989)]. To support our conclusions, we provide analytical expressions as well as numerical calculations, including optimization of field strengths and accounting for the effects of field misalignment. Our results have consequences for applications such as precision spectroscopy, techniques such as magnetometry, and stereochemical effects such as the orientation-to-alignment transition.

abstract: Optical nanofibers provide a rich platform for exploring atomic and optical phenomena even when they support only a single spatial mode. Nanofibers supporting higher-order modes provide additional degrees of freedom to enable complex evanescent field profiles for interaction with the surrounding medium, but local control of these profiles requires nondestructive evaluation of the propagating fields. Here, we use Rayleigh scattering for rapid measurement of the propagation of light in few-mode optical nanofibers. Imaging the Rayleigh scattered light provides direct visualization of the spatial evolution of propagating fields throughout the entire fiber, including the transition from core-cladding guidance to cladding-air guidance. We resolve the interference between higher-order modes to determine local beat lengths and modal content along the fiber, and show that the modal superposition in the waist can be systematically controlled by adjusting the input superposition. With this diagnostic we can measure variations in the radius of the fiber waist to below 3 nm in situ using purely optical means. This nondestructive technique also provides useful insight into light propagation in optical nanofibers.

abstract: Schr\"odinger's thought experiment to prepare a cat in a superposition of both alive and dead states reveals profound consequences of quantum mechanics and has attracted enormous interests. Here we propose a straightforward method to create quantum superposition states of a living microorganism by putting a small bacterium on top of an electromechanical oscillator. Our proposal is based on recent developments that the center-of-mass oscillation of a 15-$\mu$m-diameter aluminium membrane has been cooled to its quantum ground state [Nature 475, 359 (2011)], and entangled with a microwave field [Science, 342, 710 (2013)]. A microorganism with a mass much smaller than the mass of the electromechanical membrane will not significantly affect the quality factor of the membrane and can be cooled to the quantum ground state together with the membrane. Quantum superposition and teleportation of its center-of-mass motion state can be realized with the help of superconducting microwave circuits. More importantly, the internal states of a microorganism, such as the electron spin of a glycine radical, can be prepared in a quantum superposition state and entangled with its center-of-mass motion. Our proposal can be realized with state-of-art technologies. The proposed setup is also a quantum-limited magnetic resonance force microscope (MRFM) that not only can detect the existence of an electron spin, but also can coherently manipulate and detect the quantum state of the spin.

We have found that for proper values of the characteristic parameters of the hybrid system and the intensity of the applied field we can produce steady state quantum correlations of significant value so that they can be useful in quantum information and computation processes.

abstract: In recent years, Bayesian methods have been proposed as a solution to a wide range of issues in quantum state and process tomography. State-of- the-art Bayesian tomography solutions suffer from three problems: numerical intractability, a lack of informative prior distributions, and an inability to track time-dependent processes. Here, we solve all three problems. First, we use modern statistical methods, as pioneered by Husz\'ar and Houlsby and by Ferrie, to make Bayesian tomography numerically tractable. Our approach allows for practical computation of Bayesian point and region estimators for quantum states and channels. Second, we propose the first informative priors on quantum states and channels. Finally, we develop a method that allows online tracking of time-dependent states and estimates the drift and diffusion processes affecting a state. We provide source code and animated visual examples for our methods.

abstract: We present an exact quantization condition for the time independent solutions (energy eigenstates) of the one-dimensional Dirac equation with a scalar potential well that gives only two `effective' turning points (defined by the roots of $V(x)+mc^2=\pm E$) for a given energy $E$ and satisfies $\min V(x)+mc^2\geq 0$. This result generalizes the previously known non-relativistic quantization formula and preserves many physically desirable symmetries, besides, attaining the correct non-relativistic limit. A numerical routine is also presented that makes the formulation useful for computing energy eigenvalues.

abstract: In general, classical measurement statistics of a quantum measurement is disturbed by performing an additional incompatible quantum measurement beforehand. Using this observation, we introduce a state-independent definition of disturbance by relating it to the distinguishability problem between two classical statistical distributions --- one resulting from a single quantum measurement and the other from a succession of two quantum measurements. Interestingly, we find an error-disturbance trade-off relation for any measurements in two-dimensional Hilbert space and for measurements with mutually unbiased bases in any finite-dimensional Hilbert space. This relation shows that error should be reduced to zero in order to minimize the sum of error and disturbance. We conjecture that a similar trade-off relation can be generalized to any measurements in an arbitrary finite-dimensional Hilbert space.

abstract: Decoherence of superconducting transmon qubits is purported to be consistent with surface loss from two-level systems on the substrate surface. Here, we present a study of surface loss in transmon devices, explicitly designed to have varying sensitivities to different surface loss contributors. Our experiments also encompass two particular different sapphire substrates, which reveal the onset of a yet unknown additional loss mechanism outside of surface loss for one of the substrates. Tests across different wafers and devices demonstrate substantial variation, and we emphasize the importance of testing large numbers of devices for disentangling di?erent sources of decoherence.

abstract: We demonstrate the simultaneous dressing of both vacuum-to-exciton and exciton-to-biexciton transitions of a single semiconductor quantum dot in a high-Q micropillar cavity, using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton is achieved by spectrally tuning the quantum dot emission with respect to the cavity mode. The cavity couples to both transitions and amplifies the Rabi-frequency of the likewise resonant cw laser, driving the transitions. We observe strong-field splitting of the emission lines, which depend on the driving Rabi field amplitude and the cavity-laser detuning. A dressed state theory of a driven 4-level atom correctly predicts the distinct spectral transitions observed in the emission spectrum, and a detailed description of the emission spectra is further provided through a polaron master equation approach which accounts for cavity coupling and acoustic phonon interactions of the semiconductor medium.

abstract: Conventional statistical mechanics describes large systems and averages over many particles or over many trials. But work, heat, and entropy impact the small scales that experimentalists can increasingly control, e.g., in single-molecule experiments. The statistical mechanics of small scales has been quantified with two toolkits developed in quantum information theory: resource theories and one-shot information theory. The field has boomed recently, but the theorems amassed have hardly impacted experiments. Can thermodynamic resource theories be realized experimentally? Via what steps can we shift the theory toward physical realizations? Should we care? I present eleven opportunities in physically realizing thermodynamic resource theories.

abstract: We systematically study the localization effect in discrete-time quantum walks on a honeycomb network and establish the mathematical framework. We focus on the Grover walk first and rigorously derive the limit form of the walker's state, showing it has a certain probability to be localized at the starting position. The relationship between localization and the initial coin state is concisely represented by a linear map. We also define and calculate the average probability of localization by generating random initial states. Further, coin operators varying with positions are considered and the sufficient condition for localization is discussed. We also similarly analyze another four-state Grover walk. Theoretical predictions are all in accord with numerical simulation results. Finally, our results are compared with previous works to demonstrate the unusual trapping effect of quantum walks on a honeycomb network, as well as the advantages of our method.

abstract: We consider a system consisting of a large individual quantum dot with excitonic resonance coupled to a single mode photonic cavity in the nonlinear regime when exciton- exciton interaction becomes important. We show that in the presence of time-modulated external coherent pumping the system demonstrates essentially non classical behavior reflected in sub-Poissonian statistics of exciton- and photon-modes and the Wigner functions with negative values in phase-space for time-intervals exceeding the characteristic time of dissipative processes, $t\gg\gamma^{-1}$. It is shown that these results are cardinally different from the analogous results in the regime of the monomode continues-wave (cw) excitation.

It is shown that the QFI depends on the estimated parameter and its decay could be reduced by the squeezed reservoir compared with thermal (vacuum) reservoir, in particular, if the squeezing phase matching is satisfied.

abstract: The generic bound of quantum speed limit time (the minimal evolution time) for a qubit system interacting with structural environment is investigated. We define a new bound for the quantum speed limit. It is shown that the non-Markovianity and the population of the excited state can fail to signal the quantum evolution acceleration, but the initial-state dependence is an important factor. In particular, we find that different quantum speed limits could produce contradictory predictions on the quantum evolution acceleration.

abstract: In this paper we present a high-level numerical model for estimating rates of accidental coincidence between a pair of passively quenched Geiger mode avalanche photodiodes operating in the saturated regime. By considering the recovery time of both the photodiodes and the detection circuit we introduce the concept of an "effective duty cycle" and show that it may be estimated by numeric simulation. The impact of effective duty cycle on the observed accidental rate is examined and we demonstrate that post-processing using the updated model leads to improved visibility in actual experiments. This will improve the signal-to-noise ratio in some applications which depend on coincidence measurements and can be extended to scenarios with more than two detectors.

abstract: We present a quantum circuit representation consisting entirely of qubit initialisations (I), a network of controlled-NOT gates (C) and measurements with respect to different bases (M). The ICM representation is useful for optimisation of quantum circuits that include teleportation, which is required for fault-tolerant, error corrected quantum computation. The non-deterministic nature of teleportation necessitates the conditional introduction of corrective quantum gates and additional ancillae during circuit execution. Therefore, the standard optimisation objectives, gate count and number of wires, are not well-defined for general teleportation-based circuits. The transformation of a circuit into the ICM representation provides a canonical form for an exact fault-tolerant, error corrected circuit needed for optimisation prior to the final implementation in a realistic hardware model.

abstract: Quantum simulators based on nuclear spin-systems controlled by NMR techniques have been used for studying various quantum phenomena. In this work, using a four-qubit NMR quantum simulator, we investigate the recently postulated quantum pigeon-hole effect. In mathematics, the pigeonhole effect is described by a set of three objects being allocated with only two containers. Classically, one would expect at least one container to accommodate more than one object. However, recently it was predicted that there exist quantum scenarios wherein three quantum particles appear to reside in two containers in such a way that no two particles can be simultaneously assigned with a single container. In our experiments, quantum pigeons are emulated by three nuclear qubits whose states are probed jointly and noninvasively by an ancillary spin. The qubit-states $\{\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}\}$ emulate the two containers available for each of the qubits. The experimental results are in good agreement with quantum theoretical predictions.

abstract: One long-standing difficult problem in quantum dissipative dynamics is to solve the spin-boson model in a non-Markovian regime where a tractable systematic master equation does not exist. The spin-boson model is particularly important due to its crucial applications in quantum noise control and manipulation as well as its central role in developing quantum theories of open systems. Here we solve this important model by developing a non-Markovian quantum Langevin approach. By projecting the quantum Langevin equation onto the coherent states of the bath, we can derivie a set of non-Markovian quantum Bloch equations containing no explicit noise variables. This special feature offers a tremendous advantage over the existing stochastic Schr\"odinger equations in numerical simulations. The physical significance and generality of our approach are briefly discussed.

abstract: We derive a general theory for the joint weak measurement with arbitrary postselection and employ it in the time-delay measurement. Especially, we study two special cases, i.e., the balanced and unbalanced postselection regimes, and present an experiment to verify the theoretical results. The experimental results show that under similar conditions, the signal-to-noise ratio of using joint weak measurement scheme remains higher than 12 dB when the measured time-delay is smaller the ultimate precision limit of the weak-value amplification scheme. Moreover, the joint weak measurement scheme is robust to the misalignment errors and the wavelength-dependency of optical components, which indicates its advantage of improving the measurement precision with convenient laboratory equipments.

abstract: In order to improve the key rate of the decoy-state method, we need to jointly study yields of different bases. Given the delicate fact that pulses of the same preparation state can have different counting rates if they are measured in different bases, for example, those vacuum pulses and those single-photon pulses, existing results of decoy-state quantum key distribution using biased bases are actually flawed by assuming that they are equal. We fix this flaw through using the idea that yields of pulses prepared in different bases are same provided that they are prepared in the same state and also they are measured in the same basis, for example, those single-photon pulses prepared in different bases but measured in the same basis. Based on this, we present correct formulas for the decoy-state method using biased bases. Taking the effects of statistical fluctuations into account, we then numerically study the key rates of different protocols with all parameters being fully optimized. Our result confirms the prior art conclusion that decoy-state method using biased bases can have advantage to the symmetric protocol with unbiased bases. We obtain high key rates of our 4-intensity protocol (two in X bases and two in Z bases) without using any vacuum source.

We also show that spin squeezing has no relationship with quantum entanglement.

We test our scheme by simulating coherence and entanglement detection in a three-qubit GHZ-diagonal state.

abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum estimation by means of parametric amplification in circuit Quantum Electrodynamics. The modulation of a SQUID interrupting a superconducting waveguide transforms an initial thermal two-mode squeezed state in such a way that the new state is sensitive to the features of the parametric amplifier. We find the optimal initial parameters which maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. In order to achieve a large number of independent measurements we propose to use an array of non-interacting resonators. We show that the combination of both large QFI and large number of measurements enables -in principle- the use of this setup for Quantum Metrology applications.

abstract: The security proof of continuous variable (CV) measurement device independent (MDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) cannot be reduced to the analysis of one-mode Gaussian attacks (in particular, independent entangling-cloner attacks). To stress this point, the present note provides a very simple (almost trivial) argument, showing that there are an infinite number of two-mode Gaussian attacks which cannot be reduced to or simulated by one-mode Gaussian attacks. This result further confirms that the security analysis of CV-MDI-QKD must involve a careful minimization over two-mode attacks as originally performed in [S. Pirandola et al., Nature Photon. 9, 397-402 (2015)].

abstract: We present a few-parameter ansatz for pulses to implement arbitrary simultaneous single-qubit rotations in frequency-crowded multi-level systems. Specifically, we consider a system of two qutrits whose working and leakage transitions suffer from spectral crowding (detuned by $\delta$). In order to achieve precise controllability, we make use of two driving fields (each having two quadratures) at two different tones to implement arbitrary simultaneous rotations. Expanding the waveforms in terms of Hanning windows, we show how analytic pulses containing smooth and composite-pulse features can easily achieve gate errors $<10^{-4}$ and considerably outperform known adiabatic techniques. Moreover, we find a generalization of the WahWah method by Schutjens et al. [Phys. Rev. A 88, 052330 (2013)] that allows precise separate single-qubit rotations for all gate times beyond a quantum speed limit. We find in all cases a quantum speed limit $\sim 2\pi/\delta$ for the gate time and show that our pulses are robust against variations in system parameters and filtering due to transfer functions, making them suitable for experimental implementations.

abstract: Adiabatic state engineering is a powerful technique in quantum information and quantum control. However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as provided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up the adiabatic quantum behavior. Here, we propose a superadiabatic route to implement universal quantum computation. Our method is based on the realization of piecewise controlled superadiabatic evolutions. Remarkably, they can be obtained by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. In particular, we discuss the implementation of fast rotation gates and arbitrary n-qubit controlled gates, which can be used to design different sets of universal quantum gates. Concerning the energy cost of the superadiabatic implementation, we show that it is dictated by the quantum speed limit, providing an upper bound for the corresponding adiabatic counterparts.

abstract: The laws of thermodynamics put limits to the efficiencies of thermal machines. Analogues of these laws are now established for quantum engines weakly and passively coupled to the environment providing a framework to find improvements to their performance. Systems whose interaction with the environment is actively controlled do not fall in that framework. Here we consider systems actively and locally coupled to the environment, evolving with a so-called boundary-driven Lindblad equation. Starting from a unitary description of the system plus the environment we simultaneously obtain the Lindblad equation and the appropriate expressions for heat, work and entropy-production of the system extending the framework for the analysis of new, and some already proposed, quantum heat engines. We illustrate our findings in spin 1/2 chains and explain why an XX chain coupled in this way to a single heat bath relaxes to thermodynamic-equilibrium while and XY chain does not. Additionally, we show that an XX chain coupled to a left and a right heat baths behaves as a quantum engine, a heater or refrigerator depending on the parameters, with efficiencies bounded by Carnot efficiencies.

abstract: The properties of quantum information in space-time can be investigated by studying operational tasks. In one such task, summoning, an unknown quantum state is supplied at one point, and a call is made at another for it to be returned at a third. Hayden-May recently proved necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteeing successful return of a summoned state for finite sets of call and return points when there is a guarantee of at most one summons. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions when there may be several possible summonses and complying with any one constitutes success. We show there is a "quantum paradox of choice" in summoning: the extra freedom in completing the task makes it strictly harder. This intriguing result has practical applications for distributed quantum computing and cryptography and also implications for our understanding of relativistic quantum information and its localization in space-time.

abstract: We study discrete quantum dynamics where single evolution step consists of unitary system transformation followed by decoherence via coupling to an environment. Often non-Markovian memory effects are attributed to structured environments whereas here we take a more general approach within discrete setting. In addition of controlling the structure of the environment, we are interested in how local unitaries on the open system allow the appearance and control of memory effects. Our first simple qubit model, where local unitary is followed by dephasing, illustrates how memory effects arise despite of having no-structure in the environment the system is coupled with. We then elaborate this observation by constructing a model for open quantum walk where the unitary coin and transfer operation is augmented with dephasing of the coin. The results demonstrate that in the limit of strong dephasing within each evolution step, the combined coin-position open system always displays memory effects and their quantity is independent of the structure of the environment. Our construction makes possible an experimentally realizable open quantum walk with photons exhibiting non-Markovian features.

abstract: We present recursive multiport schemes for implementing quantum Fourier transforms and the inversion step in Grover's algorithm on an integrated linear optics device. In particular, each scheme shows how to execute a quantum operation on $2d$ modes using a pair of circuits for the same operation on $d$ modes. To evaluate the schemes against realistic errors, we ran simulations of proof-of-principle experiments using a simple fabrication model of silicon-based photonic integrated devices that employ directional couplers and thermo-optic modulators for beam splitters and phase shifters, respectively. We find that high-fidelity performance is achievable with our multiport circuits for $2$-qubit and $3$-qubit quantum Fourier transforms, and for quantum search on $4$-item and $8$-item databases.

abstract: We introduce a new class of 3D color codes, which we call stacked codes, together with a fault-tolerant transformation that will map logical qubits encoded in 2D color codes into stacked codes and back. The stacked code allows for the transversal implementation of a non-Clifford $\pi/8$ logical gate, which when combined with the logical Clifford gates that are transversal in the 2D color code give a gate set which is both fault-tolerant and universal without requiring non-stabilizer magic states. We then show that the layers forming the stacked code can be unfolded and arranged in a 2D layout. As only Clifford gates can be implemented transversally for 2D topological stabilizer codes, a non-local operation must be incorporated in order to allow for this transversal application of a non-Clifford gate. Our code achieves this operation through the transformation from a 2D color code to the unfolded stacked code induced by measuring only geometrically local stabilizers and gauge operators within the bulk of 2D color codes together with a non-local operator that has support on a 1D boundary between such 2D codes. We believe that this proposed method to implement the non-local operation is a realistic one for 2D stabilizer layouts and would be beneficial in avoiding the large overheads caused by magic state distillation.

The eigenvalues of the latter matrix are the natural frequencies of the Hamiltonian operator. When all the eigenvalues of the matrix are real, then the spectrum of the symmetric Hamiltonian is real and the operator is Hermitian. As illustrative examples we choose the quadratic Hamiltonians that model a pair of coupled resonators with balanced gain and loss, the electromagnetic self-force on an oscillating charged particle and an active LRC circuit.

abstract: Many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements when compared to what is available today. To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as "the quantum variational eigensolver" was developed with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through relaxation of exponential splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.

abstract: We put forward a strategy to encode a quantum algorithm into the unmodulated dynamics of a quantum network without the need of external control pulses, measurements or active feedback. Our optimization scheme, inspired by supervised machine learning, consists in engineering the pairwise couplings between the network qubits so that the target quantum operation is encoded in the natural reduced dynamics of a network section. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by the finding of uncontrolled four-qubit networks which implement either the Toffoli gate, the Fredkin gate, or remote logic operations. The proposed Toffoli gate is stable against imperfections, has a high-fidelity for fault tolerant quantum computation, and is fast, being based on the non-equilibrium dynamics.

abstract: The geometric phase deficit is defined as the difference between the geometric phase acquired by the global system and sum of the geometric phases acquired by subsystems during local unitary evolutions. We show that a non-zero value of the geometric phase deficit for a composite quantum system can be a signature of quantum entanglement. In the context of macroscopic quantum systems, we illustrate how the geometric phase deficit can be used to detect macroscopically entangled states. In particular, we use the geometric phase deficit to detect the entanglement for macroscopic superposition of coherent states. Furthermore, we show that by measuring the geometric phase deficit one can measure the concurrence of two spin singlets between distant boundaries.

abstract: We consider bipartite systems as versatile probes for the estimation of transformations acting locally on one of the subsystems. We investigate what resources are required for the probes to offer a guaranteed level of metrological performance, when the latter is averaged over specific sets of local transformations. We quantify such a performance via the average skew information, a convex quantity which we compute in closed form for bipartite states of arbitrary dimensions, and which is shown to be strongly dependent on the degree of local purity of the probes. Our analysis contrasts and complements the recent series of studies focused on the minimum, rather than the average, performance of bipartite probes in local estimation tasks, which was instead determined by quantum correlations other than entanglement. We provide explicit prescriptions to characterize the most reliable states maximizing the average skew information, and elucidate the role of state purity, separability and correlations in the classification of optimal probes. Our results can help in the identification of useful resources for sensing, estimation and discrimination applications when complete knowledge of the interaction mechanism realizing the local transformation is unavailable, and access to pure entangled probes is technologically limited.

abstract: We discuss the known construction of two interacting superconducting circuits, based on Josephson junctions, that can be precisely engineered and easily controlled. In particular, we use the parametric excitation of two circuits, realized by an instant change of the qubit coupling, to study entropic and information properties of the density matrix of the composite system. The density matrix is obtained from the initial thermal state and is then analyzed in the approximation of small perturbation parameter and sufficiently low temperature. We also check the subadditivity condition for this system both for von Neumann and deformed entropies and look at the dependance of mutual information on the temperature of the system. Finally, we discuss the applicability of this approach to describe such system of two coupled superconducting qubits as harmonic oscillators with limited Hilbert space.

authors: Lorenzo Campos Venuti
comments: Text updated. Added discussion on quantum speed limit
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.04352
abstract: Generic quantum systems --as much as their classical counterparts-- pass arbitrarily close to their initial state after sufficiently long time. Here we provide an essentially exact computation of such recurrence times for generic non-integrable quantum models. The result is a universal function which depends on just two parameters, an energy scale and the effective dimension of the system. As a by-product we prove that the density of orthogonalization times is zero if at least nine levels are populated and connections with the quantum speed limit are discussed. We also extend our results to integrable, quasi-free fermions. For generic systems the recurrence time is generally doubly exponential in the system volume whereas for the integrable case the dependence is only exponential. The recurrence time can be decreased by several orders of magnitude by performing a small quench close to a quantum critical point. This setup may lead to the experimental observation of such \emph{fast} recurrences.

abstract: In this paper we address the question of whether it is possible to obtain evidence that we are in a superposition of different worlds, as suggested by the relative state interpretation of quantum mechanics. We find that it is impossible to find definitive proof, and that if one wishes to retain reliable memories of which world one was in, no evidence at all can be found. We then show that even for completely linear quantum state evolution, there is a test that can be done to tell if you can be placed in a superposition.

abstract: A fundamental element of quantum information processing with photonic qubits is the nonclassical quantum interference between two photons when they bunch together via the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect. Ultimately, many such pure photons must be processed in complex interferometric networks, and for this it is essential to synchronize the arrival times of the flying photons preserving their purity. Here we demonstrate for the first time the HOM interference of two heralded, pure optical photons synchronized through two independent quantum memories. Controlled storage times up to 1.8 microseconds for about 90 events per second were achieved with purities sufficiently high for a negative Wigner function confirmed with homodyne measurements.

abstract: For the past twenty years, Matrix Product States (MPS) have been widely used in solid state physics to approximate the ground state of one-dimensional spin chains. In this Letter, exploiting an unnoticed connection with the theory of matrix algebras, we derive two structural properties of MPS, namely: a) there exist local operators which are invisible for all MPS of a given bond dimension; and b) there exist local transformations which, when applied over any MPS of a given bond dimension, decouple (cut) the particles where they act from the spin chain while at the same time join (glue) the two loose ends back again into an MPS. We use the notions of `invisible' and `cut-and-glue' operators to explore the limitations of the MPS approximation. In addition, we show how the high dimensionality of the `invisible space' leads to an exponential decrease in complexity of the SDP hierarchies described in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 020501 (2015)] for the characterization of finite-dimensional quantum correlations. Finally, we generalize some of our results to the ansatz of Projected Entangled Pairs States (PEPS).

abstract: A distribution function approach is applied to describe the dynamics of the laser beam in the Earth atmosphere. Using a formal solution of the kinetic equation for the distribution function, we have developed an iterative scheme for calculation of the scintillation index ($\sigma^2$). The problem reduces to obtaining the photon trajectories and their correlations. Bringing together theoretical calculations and many-fold computer integrations, the value of $\sigma^2$ is obtained. It is shown that a considerable growth of $\sigma^2$ in the range of a moderate turbulence is due to the correlations of different trajectories. The criteria of applicability of our approach for both the coherent and partially coherent light are derived.

abstract: We introduce three tunable parameters to optimize the fidelity of quantum teleportation with continuous-variable in nonideal scheme. Using the characteristic function formalism, we present the condition that the teleportation fidelity is independent of the amplitude of input coherent states for any entangled resource. Then we investigate the effects of tunable parameters on the fidelity with or without the presence of environment and imperfect measurements, by analytically deriving the expression of fidelity for three different input coherent state distributions. It is shown that, for the linear distribution, the optimization with three tunable parameters is the best one with respect to single- and two-parameter optimization. Our results reveal the usefulness of tunable parameters for improving the fidelity of teleportation and the ability against the decoherence.

abstract: Quantum computation with a complete graph of superconducting qubits has been recently proposed, and applications to amplitude amplification, phase estimation, and the simulation of realistic atomic collisions given [Phys. Rev. A 91, 062309 (2015)]. This single-excitation subspace (SES) approach does not require error correction and is practical now. Previously it was shown how to implement symmetric nxn unitaries in a single step, but not general unitaries. Here we show that any element in the unitary group U(n) can be executed in no more than three steps, for any n. This enables the implementation of highly complex operations in constant time, and in some cases even allows for the compilation of an entire algorithm down to only three operations. Using this protocol we show how to prepare any pure state of an SES chip in three steps, and also how to compute, for a given SES state rho, the expectation value of any nxn Hermitian observable O in a constant number of steps.

abstract: The investigation of arXiv 1409.2766v2 [quant-ph] has been continued by the general form of the numerous equations with partial values of arbitrary spin, which were considered in above mentioned preprint. The general forms of quantum-mechanical and covariant equations for arbitrary spin together with the general description of the arbitrary spin field formalism are presented. The corresponding relativistic quantum mechanics of arbitrary spin is given as the system of axioms. Previously ignored partial example of the spin s=(0,0) particle-antiparticle doublet is considered. The partial example of spin s=(3/2,3/2) particle-antiparticle doublet is highlighted. The new 64 dimensional Clifford--Dirac algebra over the field of real numbers is suggested. The general operator, which transformed the relativistic canonical quantum mechanics of arbitrary spin into the locally covariant field theory, has been introduced. Moreover, the study of the place of the results given in arXiv 1409.2766v2 [quant-ph] among the results of other authors is started. The review of the different investigations in the area of relativistic canonical quantum mechanics is given and the brief analysis of the existing approaches to the covariant field theory of arbitrary spin is initiated. The consideration of some important details of arXiv 1409.2766v2 [quant-ph] is improved.

We show a class of coupled systems whose interaction leaves invariant the steady state of one of the systems, i.e., only one of the reduced steady states is sensitive to the interactions. A detailed proof with the help of the Trotter product formula is presented. We apply this general statement to a few models, one of which is the optomechanical coupling model where an optical cavity is coupled to a small mechanical oscillator.

abstract: We obtain an explicit solution for the stationary state populations of a dissipative Fano model, where a discrete excited state is coupled to a continumm set of states; both excited set of states are reachable by photo-excitation from the ground state. The dissipative dynamic is described by a Liouville equation in Lindblad form and the field intensity can take arbitrary values. We show that the continuum states population as a function of laser frequency can always be expressed as a Fano profile plus a Lorentzian function with effective parameters whose explicit expressions are given in the case of a closed system coupled to a bath as well as for the original Fano scattering framework. Although the solution is intricate, it can be elegantly expressed as a linear transformation of the kernel of a $4\times 4$ matrix which has the meaning of an effective Liouvillian. We unveil key notable processes related to the optical nonlinearity and which had not been reported to date: electromagnetic induced-transparency, population inversions, power narrowing and broadening, as well as an effective reduction of the Fano asymmetry parameter.

abstract: Motivated by some recent news, a journalist asks a group of physicists: "What's the meaning of the violation of Bell's inequality?" One physicist answers: "It means that non-locality is an established fact". Another says: "There is no non-locality; the message is that measurement outcomes are irreducibly random". A third one says: "It cannot be answered simply on purely physical grounds, the answer requires an act of metaphysical judgement". Puzzled by the answers, the journalist keeps asking questions about quantum theory: "What is teleported in quantum teleportation?" "How does a quantum computer really work?" Shockingly, for each of these questions, the journalist obtains a variety of answers which, in many cases, are mutually exclusive. At the end of the day, the journalist asks: "How do you plan to make progress if, after 90 years of quantum theory, you still don't know what it means? How can you possibly identify the physical principles of quantum theory or expand quantum theory into gravity if you don't agree on what quantum theory is about?" Here we argue that it is becoming urgent to solve this too long lasting problem. For that, we point out that the interpretations of quantum theory are, essentially, of two types and that these two types are so radically different that there must be experiments that, when analyzed outside the framework of quantum theory, lead to different empirically testable predictions. Arguably, even if these experiments do not end the discussion, they will add new elements to the list of strange properties that some interpretations must have, therefore they will indirectly support those interpretations that do not need to have all these strange properties.

abstract: We study the spectral properties of a family of quantum antiferromagnets on two-dimensional (2D) lattices. This family of models is obtained by a deformation of the well-studied 2D quantum antiferromagnetic model of Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT); they are described by two-body, frustration-free Hamiltonians on a three-colourable lattice of spins, and with ground states that are resources for universal quantum computation. Although the existence of a spectral gap in the 2D AKLT model remains an open question, we rigorously prove the existence of a gap for a subset of this family of quantum antiferromagnets. This result provides a family of two-body Hamiltonians for which the ground state is a resource for universal quantum computation and for which a spectral gap is proven to exist.

abstract: Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols allow for the establishment of a secret key between two users Alice and Bob, when one of the two users (typically Bob) is limited or "classical" in nature. Recently it was shown that protocols exists when both parties are limited/classical in nature if they utilize the services of a quantum server. These protocols are called mediated SQKD protocols. This server, however, is untrusted and, in fact, adversarial. In this paper, we reconsider a mediated SQKD protocol and derive a new proof of unconditional security for it. In particular, we derive a new lower bound on its key rate in the asymptotic scenario. Furthermore, we show this new lower bound is an improvement over prior work, thus showing that the protocol in question can tolerate higher rates of error than previously thought.

abstract: We examine the effect of adding PT-symmetric gain and loss terms to quasi 1D lattices (ribbons) that possess flat bands. We focus on three representative cases: (a) The Lieb ribbon, (b) The kagome ribbon, and (c) The stub Ribbon. In general we find that the effect on the flat band depends strongly on the geometrical details of the lattice being examined. One interesting and novel result that emerge from an analytical calculation of the band structure of the Lieb ribbon including gain and loss, is that its flat band survives the addition of PT-symmetry for any amount of gain and loss, while for the other two lattices, any presence of gain and loss destroys the flat bands. For all three ribbons, there are finite stability windows whose size decreases with the strength of the gain and loss parameter. For the Lieb and kagome cases, the size of this window converges to a finite value. The existence of finite stability windows, plus the constancy of the Lieb flat band are in marked contrast to the behavior of a pure one-dimensional lattice.

abstract: We present a parameter estimation technique based on performing joint measurements of a weak interaction away from the weak-value-amplification approximation. Two detectors are used to collect full statistics of the correlations between two weakly entangled degrees of freedom. Without the need of postselection, the protocol resembles the anomalous amplification of an imaginary-weak-value-like response. The amplification is induced in the difference signal of both detectors allowing robustness to different sources of technical noise, and offering in addition the advantages of balanced signals for precision metrology. All of the Fisher information about the parameter of interest is collected, and a phase controls the amplification response. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed technique by measuring polarization rotations in a linearly polarized laser pulse. The effective sensitivity and precision of a split detector is increased when compared to a conventional continuous-wave balanced detection technique.

abstract: We study the ground state quantum correlation of Ising model in a transverse field by implementing the quantum renormalization group (QRG) theory. It is shown that various quantum correlation measures and the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality will highlight the critical point related with quantum phase transitions, and demonstrate nonanalytic phenomenon and scaling behavior when the size of the system becomes large. Our results also indicate a universal behavior of the critical exponent of Ising model under QRG that the critical exponent will not change with the variation of different quantities, even when the quantities vary from entanglement measures to quantum correlation measures. This means that the two kinds of quantum correlation criterion, including the entanglement/separability paradigm and the information-theoretic paradigm, have some connections between them. These remarkable behaviors may have important implications on condensed matter physics because the critical exponent directly associates with the correlation length exponent.

This algorithm is distinguished by accuracy in obtaining high probability of finding any marked state in a shorter time than Grover algorithm time. The algorithm performance can be improved with respect to the different values of the controlled phase. A new technique is used to generate the dynamical quantum gates in the presence of dissipation effect that helps in implementing the current algorithm.

They are: i) repeated measurements on a single copy can not provide any information on it and further, that in the limit of very large such measurements, weak measurements have exactly the same characterstics as strong measurements, ii) the apparent non-invasiveness of weak measurements is \emph{illusory} and they are no more advantageous than strong measurements even in the specific context of establishing Leggett-Garg inequalities, when errors are properly taken into account, and, finally, iii) weak value measurements are optimal, in the precise sense of Wootters and Fields, when the post-selected states are mutually unbiased with respect to the eigenstates of the observable whose weak values are being measured. Notion of weak value coordinates for state spaces are introduced and elaborated.

abstract: The readings of a highly inaccurate "weak" quantum meter, employed to determine the value of a dichotomous variable $S$ without destroying the interference between the alternatives,may take arbitrary values. We show that the expected values of its readings may take any real value, depending on the the choice of the states in which the system is pre- and post-selected. Some of these values must fall outside the range of eigenvalues of $A$, in which case they may be expressed as "anomalous" averages obtained with negative probability weights, constructed from available probability amplitudes. This behaviour is a natural consequence of the Uncertainty Principle. The phenomenon of "anomalous weak values" has no non-trivial analogue in classical statistics.

abstract: The quantum wave-function of a massive particle with small initial uncertainties (consistent with the uncertainty relation) is believed to spread very slowly, so that the dynamics is deterministic. This assumes that the classical motions for given initial data are unique. In fluid turbulence non-uniqueness due to "roughness" of the advecting velocity field is known to lead to stochastic motion of classical particles. Vanishingly small random perturbations are magnified by Richardson diffusion in a "nearly rough" velocity field so that motion remains stochastic as the noise disappears, or classical spontaneous stochasticity, . Analogies between stochastic particle motion in turbulence and quantum evolution suggest that there should be quantum spontaneous stochasticity (QSS). We show this for 1D models of a particle in a repulsive potential that is "nearly rough" with $V(x) \sim C|x|^{1+\alpha}$ at distances $|x|\gg \ell$ , for some UV cut-off $\ell$, and for initial Gaussian wave-packet centered at 0. We consider the WKB limit with $\hbar/m \to 0$, then position-spread $\sigma\to 0$. The limit of the position density is non-deterministic, with equal probabilities of the particle following either of two, non-unique classical solutions and with "Richardson-like" spreading of the wave-packet. The splitting of the wave-packet occurs in a very short time $t\sim(\ell^{1+\alpha}/C)^{1/2}$ for small $\ell$. QSS also occurs in the scattering of a wave-packet off the rough potential, for careful fine-tuning. We also consider other semi-classical limits by a numerical solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, observing QSS both in position- and momentum-space. Although the wave-function remains split into two widely separated branches in the classical limit, rapid phase oscillations within each branch prevent any coherent superposition. These effects should be observable in laboratory experiments.

abstract: A quantum particle subjected to a constant force undergoes an accelerated motion following a parabolic path, which differs from the classical motion just because of wave packet spreading (quantum diffusion). However, when a periodic potential is added (such as in a crystal) the particle undergoes Bragg scattering and an oscillatory (rather than accelerated) motion is found, corresponding to the famous Bloch oscillations. Here we introduce an exactly-solvable quantum Hamiltonian model, corresponding to a generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$, in which a quantum particle shows an intermediate dynamical behavior, namely an oscillatory motion superimposed to an accelerated one. Such a novel dynamical behavior is referred to as {\it accelerated Bloch oscillations}. Analytical expressions of the spectrum, improper eigenfunctions and propagator of the generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ are derived. Finally, it is shown that acceleration and quantum diffusion in the generalized Wannier-Stark Hamiltonian are prevented for Airy wave packets, which undergo a periodic breathing dynamics that can be referred to as {\it Airy-Bloch oscillations}.

abstract: We analyse a model for fault-tolerant quantum computation with low overhead suitable for situations where the noise is biased. The basis for this scheme is a gadget for the fault-tolerant preparation of magic states that enable universal fault-tolerant quantum computation using only Clifford gates that preserve the noise bias. We analyse the distillation of $|T\rangle$-type magic states using this gadget at the physical level, followed by concatenation with the 15-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code, and comparing our results with standard constructions. In the regime where the noise bias (rate of Pauli $Z$ errors relative to other single-qubit errors) is greater than a factor of 10, our scheme has lower overhead across a broad range of relevant noise rates.

abstract: We present several polynomial- and quasipolynomial-time approximation schemes for a large class of generalized operator norms. Special cases include the $2\rightarrow q$ norm of matrices for $q>2$, the support function of the set of separable quantum states, finding the least noisy output of entanglement-breaking quantum channels, and approximating the injective tensor norm for a map between two Banach spaces whose factorization norm through $\ell_1^n$ is bounded. These reproduce and in some cases improve upon the performance of previous algorithms by Brand\~ao-Christandl-Yard and followup work, which were based on the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy and whose analysis used techniques from quantum information such as the monogamy principle of entanglement. Our algorithms, by contrast, are based on brute force enumeration over carefully chosen covering nets. These have the advantage of using less memory, having much simpler proofs and giving new geometric insights into the problem. Net-based algorithms for similar problems were also presented by Shi-Wu and Barak-Kelner-Steurer, but in each case with a run-time that is exponential in the rank of some matrix. We achieve polynomial or quasipolynomial runtimes by using the much smaller nets that exist in $\ell_1$ spaces. This principle has been used in learning theory, where it is known as Maurey's empirical method.

abstract: We investigate the prospects of creating broad rotational wave packets by means of molecular interaction with long sequences of intense femtosecond pulses. Using state-resolved rotational Raman spectroscopy of oxygen, subject to a sequence of more than 20 laser pulses with peak intensities exceeding $10^{13}$ W/cm$^{2}$ per pulse, we show that the centrifugal distortion is the main obstacle on the way to reaching high rotational states. We demonstrate that the timing of the pulses can be optimized to partially mitigate the centrifugal limit. The cumulative effect of a long pulse sequence results in high degree of rotational coherence, which is shown to cause an efficient spectral broadening of probe light via cascaded Raman transitions.

abstract: Controlling the properties of single photons is essential for a wide array of emerging optical quantum technologies spanning quantum sensing, quantum computing, and quantum communications. Essential components for these technologies include single photon sources, quantum memories, waveguides, and detectors. The ideal spectral operating parameters (wavelength and bandwidth) of these components are rarely similar; thus, frequency conversion and spectral control are key enabling steps for component hybridization. Here we perform signal processing of single photons by coherently manipulating their spectra via a modified quantum memory. We store 723.5 nm photons, with 4.1 nm bandwidth, in a room-temperature diamond crystal; upon retrieval we demonstrate centre frequency tunability over 4.2 times the input bandwidth, and bandwidth modulation between 0.5 to 1.9 times the input bandwidth. Our results demonstrate the potential for diamond, and Raman memories in general, to be an integrated platform for photon storage and spectral conversion.

abstract: We previously extended Luenberger's approach for observer design to the quantum case, and developed a class of coherent observers which tracks linear quantum stochastic systems in the sense of mean values. In light of the fact that the Luenberger observer is commonly and successfully applied in classical control, it is interesting to investigate the role of coherent observers in quantum feedback. As the first step in exploring observer-based coherent control, in this paper we study pole-placement techniques for quantum systems using coherent observers, and in such a fashion, poles of a closed-loop quantum system can be relocated at any desired locations. In comparison to classical feedback control design incorporating the Luenberger observer, here direct coupling between a quantum plant and the observer-based controller are allowed to enable a greater degree of freedom for the design of controller parameters. A separation principle is presented, and we show how to design the observer and feedback independently to be consistent with the laws of quantum mechanics. The proposed scheme is applicable to coherent feedback control of quantum systems, especially when the transient dynamic response is of interest, and this issue is illustrated in an example.

abstract: Leggett-Garg inequalities are an important milestone in our quest to bridge the classical-quantum divide. An experimental investigation of these inequalities requires the so called \emph{non-invasive measurements}(NIM). It has become popular to invoke weak measurements as the means of realising NIMs to very good approximation, because of their allegedly low disturbance of systems under measurement. In this note, this is shown to be a myth; it is shown, by simple estimates of errors, that for comparable levels of statistical errors, even the strong or projective measurements can be used. In fact, it is shown that resource-wise, strong measurements are even preferable.

abstract: We investigate decoupling, one of the most important primitives in quantum Shannon theory, by replacing the uniformly distributed random unitaries (and more specifically, unitary 2-designs) commonly used to achieve the protocol, with random diagonal-unitaries. In particular, we show that the alternate application of random diagonal-unitaries in the Pauli-$Z$ and -$X$ bases can achieve a decoupling rate equal to that achieved with uniformly distributed random unitaries. This strategy was recently shown to achieve an approximate unitary $2$-design after a number of repetitions of the process. This implies that the strategy gradually achieves decoupling. Here, we prove that even fewer repetitions of the process are sufficient to achieve decoupling. Based on this, we provide a simple quantum circuit achieving decoupling, which can be partitioned into a constant number of commuting parts. We also present applications of our decoupling theorem to coherent state merging and relative thermalization.

abstract: We generalize the control power of a perfect controlled teleportation on some entangled three-qubit pure state suggested in [Phy. Rev. A {\bf 90}, 052305 (2014)] to the control power of a general controlled teleportation on a multi-qubit pure state. In addition, we define the minimal control power, and calculate the values of the minimal control power on a class of general three-qubit GHZ states and the three-qubit W class whose states have zero three-tangles. Moreover, we show that the standard GHZ state and the standard W state have the maximal values of the minimal control power on the two classes, respectively. This means that the minimal control power can be interpreted as not only an operational quantity of a multi-partite quantum communication but also a degree of multi-partite entanglement.

abstract: The pioneering experiments of linear spectroscopy were performed using flames in the 1800s, but nonlinear optical measurements had to wait until lasers became available in the twentieth century. Because the nonlinear cross section of materials is very small, usually macroscopic bulk samples and pulsed lasers are used. Numerous efforts have explored coherent nonlinear signal generation from individual nanoparticles or small atomic ensembles with millions of atoms. Experiments on a single semiconductor quantum dot have also been reported, albeit with a very small yield. Here, we report on coherent nonlinear spectroscopy of a single molecule under continuous-wave single-pass illumination, where efficient photon-molecule coupling in a tight focus allows switching of a laser beam by less than a handful of pump photons nearly resonant with the sharp molecular transition. Aside from their fundamental importance, our results emphasize the potential of organic molecules for applications such as quantum information processing, which require strong nonlinearities.

abstract: In an accompanying paper, we have put forward an interpretation of quantum mechanics grounded on a non-relativistic, Lagrangian, 3+1 formalism of a closed Universe, existing on timeless configuration space. However, not much was said there about the role of locality, which was not assumed. In this paper, I describe how subsystems existing in (spatial) regions with fixed boundary conditions can be represented as submanifolds of the complete configuration space. I show that if the action functional can be put in the form of Riemannian distance element, then dynamical independence of the subsystem implies that the respective submanifolds are totally geodesic. When two regions are mutually independent the semi-classical path integral kernel factorizes, showing cluster decomposition. To exemplify these constructions I then construct a specific gravitational system with two propagating physical degrees of freedom and no refoliation-invariance. Finally, considering the path integral in this 3+1 context, I implement an unusual sort of gauge-fixing for this system: given an initial representative of the gauge orbit, it fixes the path velocities to be parallel propagated, i.e. it fixes a horizontal lift for each path in the principal fiber bundle as opposed to a section of the principal fiber bundle. This facilitates the writing of the Fadeev-Popov determinant for our system, and completely determines the gauge-fixed path integral.

abstract: Operators in quantum mechanics - either observables, density or evolution operators, unitary or not - can be represented by c-numbers in operator bases. The position and momentum bases are in one to one correspondence with lagrangian planes in double phase space, but this is also true for the well known Wigner-Weyl correspondence based on translation and reflection operators. These phase space methods are here extended to the representation of superoperators. We show that the Choi-Jamiolkowsky isomorphism between the dynamical matrix and the linear action of the superoperator constitutes a "double" Wigner or chord transform when represented in double phase space. As a byproduct several previously unknown integral relationships between products of Wigner and chord distributions for pure states are derived.

abstract: We study the performance of two measures of non-Markovianity in detecting memory effects in two-qubit dephasing channels. By combining independent Markovian and non-Markovian noise on the qubits, our results show that the trace distance measure is able to detect the memory effects when at least one of the local channels displays non-Markovianity. A measure based on channel capacity, in turn, becomes non-zero when the global two-qubit dynamics shows memory effects. We apply these schemes to a well-known superdense coding protocol and demonstrate an optimal noise configuration to maximize the information transmission with independent local noises.

We realize both single-qubit operations and nearest-neighbor entangling gates with Raman laser beams, and we interleave the two gate types. We report average single-qubit gate fidelities as high as 0.970(1) for two-, three-, and four-ion chains, characterized with randomized benchmarking. We generate Bell states between the nearest-neighbor pairs of a three-ion chain, with fidelity up to 0.84(2). We combine one- and two-qubit gates to perform quantum process tomography of a CNOT gate in a two-ion chain, and we report an overall fidelity of 0.76(3).

abstract: We present an analysis of electron transport through two weakly coupled precision placed phosphorus donors in silicon. In particular, we examine the (1,1) to (0,2) charge transition where we predict a new type of current blockade driven entirely by the nuclear spin dynamics. Using this nuclear spin blockade mechanism we devise a protocol to readout the state of single nuclear spins using electron transport measurements only. We extend our model to include realistic effects such as Stark shifted hyperfine interactions and multi-donor clusters. In the case of multi-donor clusters we show how nuclear spin blockade can be alleviated allowing for low magnetic field electron spin measurements.

abstract: The ability to characterize static and time-dependent electric fields in situ is an important prerequisite for quantum-optics experiments with atoms close to surfaces. Especially in experiments which aim at coupling Rydberg atoms to the near field of superconducting circuits, the identification and subsequent elimination of sources of stray fields is crucial. We present a technique that allows the determination of stray-electric-field distributions $(F^\text{str}_\text{x}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{y}(\vec{r}),F^\text{str}_\text{z}(\vec{r}))$ at distances of less than $2~\text{mm}$ from (cryogenic) surfaces using coherent Rydberg-Stark spectroscopy in a pulsed supersonic beam of metastable $1\text{s}^12\text{s}^1~{}^{1}S_{0}$ helium atoms. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by characterizing the electric stray field emanating from a structured superconducting surface. Exploiting coherent population transfer with microwave radiation from a coplanar waveguide, the same technique allows the characterization of the microwave-field distribution above the surface.

abstract: Leakage errors occur when a quantum system leaves the two-level qubit subspace. Reducing these errors is critically important for quantum error correction to be viable. To quantify leakage errors, we use randomized benchmarking in conjunction with measurement of the leakage population. We characterize single qubit gates in a superconducting qubit, and by refining our use of Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) pulse shaping along with detuning of the pulses, we obtain gate errors consistently below $10^{-3}$ and leakage rates at the $10^{-5}$ level. With the control optimized, we find that a significant portion of the remaining leakage is due to incoherent heating of the qubit.

abstract: This paper presents a model reduction method for the class of linear quantum stochastic systems often encountered in quantum optics and their related fields. The approach is proposed on the basis of an interpolatory projection ensuring that specific input-output responses of the original and the reduced-order systems are matched at multiple selected points (or frequencies). Importantly, the physical realizability property of the original quantum system imposed by the law of quantum mechanics is preserved under our tangential interpolatory projection. An error bound is established for the proposed model reduction method and an avenue to select interpolation points is proposed. A passivity preserving model reduction method is also presented. Examples of both active and passive systems are provided to illustrate the merits of our proposed approach.

abstract: This paper establishes that generic linear quantum stochastic systems have a pure cascade realization of their transfer function, generalizing an earlier result established only for the special class of completely passive linear quantum stochastic systems. In particular, a cascade realization therefore exists for generic active linear quantum stochastic systems that require an external source of quanta to operate. The results facilitate a simplified realization of generic linear quantum stochastic systems for applications such as coherent feedback control and optical filtering. The key tools that are developed are algorithms for symplectic QR and Schur decompositions. It is shown that generic real square matrices of even dimension can be transformed into a lower $2 \times 2$ block triangular form by a symplectic similarity transformation. The linear algebraic results herein may be of independent interest for applications beyond the problem of transfer function realization for quantum systems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the main results. In particular, one example describes an equivalent realization of the transfer function of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier as the cascade interconnection of two degenerate parametric amplifiers with an additional outcoupling mirror.

abstract: One main goal of quantum control is to steer a quantum system toward an expected state or dynamics. For measurement-induced quantum control, measurements serve as the only control, which is like the cases in quantum Zeno and anti-zeno effects. In this paper, this scenario will be investigated in a general $N$-level quantum system. It is proved that, when the intial and expected states are both pure, the control space could be reduced to an effective subspace spanned by these two states only. This result will greatly simplify the measurement-induced control strategy of an $N$-level quantum system.

In this way, not quite obvious consequences of standard quantum mechanics are derived that may look quite different from what is usually written in textbooks. In addition, some truly new ideas are introduced concerning quantum models of classical properties as well as quantum theory of measurement. Such ideas are necessary to make the interpretation self-consistent. The book ought to be accessible to students of theoretical physics that finished the standard course of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We present a scheme of positioning a single electron spin with sub-nanometer resolution through multiple nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. With unwanted noise suppressed by dynamical decoupling, the spin coherence of each center develops characteristic oscillations due to a single electron spin located $4{\sim20}$ nm away from the centers. We can extract the position information from the characteristic oscillations of each center. This scheme is useful for high-resolution nanoscale magnetometry and spin-based quantum computing.

abstract: We propose a new protocol for thr manipulation of a three-level artificial atom in Lambda ($\Lambda$) configuration in the absence of a direct pump coupling. It allows faithful, selective and robust population transfer analogous to stimulated Raman adiabatic passage ($\Lambda$-STIRAP), in highly noise protected superconducting artificial atoms. It combines the use of a two-photon pump pulse with suitable advanced control, operated by a slow modulation of the phase of the external fields, leveraging on the stability of semiclassical microwave drives. This protocol is a building block for novel tasks in complex quantum architectures. Its demonstration would be a benchmark for the implementation of a class of multilevel advanced control procedures for quantum computation and microwave quantum photonics in systems based on artificial atoms.

Specifically, we discuss the matter-wave analogue of the rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) technique for a high fidelity and robust loading of a single atom into a harmonic ring potential from a harmonic trap, and for its transport between two concentric rings. We also consider a system of three concentric rings and investigate the transport of a single atom between the innermost and the outermost rings making use of the matter-wave analogue of the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) technique. We describe the RAP-like and STIRAP-like dynamics by means of a two- and a three-state models, respectively, obtaining good agreement with the numerical simulations of the corresponding two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation.

Using natural abundance Rb in \SI{100}{Torr}of N$_2$ buffer gas, and squeezed light from a sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator stabilized \SI{20}{GHz}to the blue of the D$_1$ resonance, we observe that an input squeezing of \SI{3.0}{dB} improves the signal-to-noise ratio by \SI{1.5}{dB} to \SI{2.6}{dB} over the combined (power)$\otimes$(number density) ranges (\SI{0.5}{mW} to \SI{4.0}{mW})$\otimes$(\SI{1.5d12}{cm\tothe{-3}} to \SI{1.3d13}{cm\tothe{-3}}), covering the full practical range and into the strongly-perturbed regime. We show that in these conditions squeezing improves the trade-off between statistical noise and systematic shifts, a new kind of quantum advantage.

abstract: In this work we present a new generic feature of PT-symmetric Bose-Einstein condensates by studying the many-particle description of a two-mode condensate with balanced gain and loss. This is achieved using a master equation in Lindblad form whose mean-field limit is a PT-symmetric Gross-Pitaevskii equation. It is shown that the purity of the condensate periodically drops to small values but then is nearly completely restored. This has a direct impact on the average contrast in interference experiments which cannot be covered by the mean-field approximation, in which a completely pure condensate is assumed.

We conditionally enhance the interqubit coupling by quantum interference. Both before and after the interqubit interaction, one of the qubits is coherently coupled to an auxiliary quantum system, and finally it is projected back onto qubit subspace. We experimentally verify the practical feasibility of this technique by using a linear optical setup with weak interferometric coupling between single-photon qubits. Our procedure is universally applicable to a wide range of physical platforms including hybrid systems such as atomic clouds or optomechanical oscillators coupled to light.

abstract: Extending the single photon transmission distance is a basic requirement for the implementation of quantum communication on a global scale. In this work we report the single photon exchange from a medium Earth orbit satellite (MEO) at more than 7000 km of slanted distance to the ground station at the Matera Laser Ranging Observatory. The single photon transmitter was realized by exploiting the corner cube retro-reflectors mounted on the LAGEOS-2 satellite. Long duration of data collection is possible with such altitude, up to 43 minutes in a single passage. The mean number of photons per pulse ({\mu}sat) has been limited to 1 for 200 seconds, resulting in an average detection rate of 3.0 cps and a signal to noise ratio of 1.5. The feasibility of single photon exchange from MEO satellites paves the way to tests of Quantum Mechanics in moving frames and to global Quantum Information.

abstract: We address the problem of understanding from first principles the conditions under which a closed quantum system equilibrates rapidly with respect to a concrete observable. Previously known general upper bounds on the time scales of equilibration were extremely long, with times scaling linearly with the dimension of the Hilbert space. Moreover, these bounds proved to be tight, since particular constructions of observables scaling in this way were found. In this paper we provide a new upper bound on the equilibration time scales which shows, in fact, equilibration is much faster under some physically reasonable conditions. In particular, we apply this result to give bounds on the time scales of equilibration for a system interacting with a thermal bath which do not scale with the size of the bath.

abstract: The recent progress in the analytical solution of models invented to describe theoretically the interaction of matter with light on an atomic scale is reviewed. The methods employ the classical theory of linear differential equations in the complex domain (Fuchsian equations). The linking concept is provided by the Bargmann Hilbert space of analytic functions, which is isomorphic to $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, the standard Hilbert space for a single continuous degree of freedom in quantum mechanics. I give the solution of the quantum Rabi model in some detail and sketch the solution of its generalization, the asymmetric Dicke model. Characteristic properties of the respective spectra are derived directly from the singularity structure of the corresponding system of differential equations.

abstract: The problem of construction of a quantum master equation for a system of sites weakly coupled to each other and to one or more reservoirs (open quantum network) is considered. Microscopic derivation of a quantum master equation requires a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the network, which can be a difficult task. When the inter-site couplings are weak, the local approach, which neglects the influence of the inter-site couplings on the system-reservoir couplings, is often used. Recently, some doubts were cast to the consistency of the local approach. We develop a systematic perturbation expansion to derive corrections to the local approach and establish its range of validity. Using this extension of the local approach, we derive an expression for the heat flux for a particular model and show that it does not violate the second law of thermodynamics.

For parameters corresponding to up-to-date experimental devices we predict succesful operation of the router with probabilities above 94%.

Using these tools, we develop the first provably efficient quantum algorithm for finding hidden subhypergroups of nilpotent abelian hypergroups and, via the aforementioned connection, a new, hypergroup-based algorithm for the HNSP on nilpotent groups. We also give efficient methods for manipulating non-unitary, non-monomial stabilizers and an adaptive Fourier sampling technique of general interest.

abstract: Superconducting microresonators have been successfully utilized as detection elements for a wide variety of applications. With multiplexing factors exceeding 1,000 detectors per transmission line, they are the most scalable low-temperature detector technology demonstrated to date. For high-throughput applications, fewer detectors can be coupled to a single wire but utilize a larger per-detector bandwidth. For all existing designs, fluctuations in fabrication tolerances result in a non-uniform shift in resonance frequency and sensitivity, which ultimately limits the efficiency of band-width utilization. Here we present the design, implementation, and initial characterization of a superconducting microresonator readout integrating two tunable inductances per detector. We demonstrate that these tuning elements provide independent control of both the detector frequency and sensitivity, allowing us to maximize the transmission line bandwidth utilization. Finally we discuss the integration of these detectors in a multilayer fabrication stack for high-speed readout of the D-Wave quantum processor, highlighting the use of control and routing circuitry composed of single flux-quantum loops to minimize the number of control wires at the lowest temperature stage.

We demonstrate that for particular coin operators the system generates a highly entangled cluster state, of use in one way quantum computation.

In the proposed device, a superconducting qubit is coupled dispersively to two resonators: one is used to form an impedance-matched $\Lambda$ system that deterministically captures incoming photons, and the other is used for continuous monitoring of the event. The present scheme enables efficient photon detection: for realistic system parameters, the detection efficiency reaches 0.9 with a bandwidth of about ten megahertz.

In this paper, we propose two BQC protocols, in which the client does not have to generate photons, but only has to perform either rotation or reorder on the received photons.

We report an efficient protocol to realize CQSDC using Cluster state and then go on to construct a (2-3)-CQSDC using Brown state, where a coalition of any two of the three controllers is required to retrieve the complete message. We argue both protocols to be unconditionally secure and analyze the efficiency of the protocols to show it to outperform the existing schemes while maintaining the same security specifications.

A close correlation between the classical Lyapunov exponents and the quantum Participation Ratio of coherent states on the eigenenergy basis is exhibited for different points in the phase space. It is also shown that the Participation Ratio scales linearly with the number of atoms in chaotic regions, and with its square root in the regular ones.

abstract: Moving cavities promise to be a suitable system for relativistic quantum information processing. It has been shown that an inertial and a uniformly accelerated one-dimensional cavity can become entangled by letting an atom emit an excitation while it passes through the cavities, but the acceleration degrades the ability to generate entanglement. We show that in the two-dimensional case the entanglement generated is affected not only by the cavity's acceleration but also by its transverse dimension which plays the role of an effective mass.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.05968
abstract: We consider some of the methods that can be used to reveal the general features of how wave functions evolve with time in the harmonic oscillator. We first review the periodicity properties over each multiple of a quarter of the classical period of oscillation. Then we show that any wave function can be simply transformed so that its centroid, defined by the expectation values of position and momentum, remains at rest at the center of the oscillator. This implies that we need only consider the evolution of this restricted class of wave functions; the evolution of all others can be reduced to these. The evolution of the spread in position $\Delta_x$ and momentum $\Delta_p$ throws light on energy and uncertainty and on squeezed and coherent states. Finally we show that any wave function can be transformed so that $\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_p$ do not change with time and that the evolution of all wave functions can easily be found from the evolution of those at rest at the origin with unchanging $\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_p$.

abstract: We analyze the problem of quantifying entanglement in pure and mixed states of fermionic systems with fixed number parity yet not necessarily fixed particle number. The "mode entanglement" between one single-particle level and its orthogonal complement is first considered, and an entanglement entropy for such a partition of a particular basis of the single-particle Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ is defined. The sum over all single-particle modes of this entropy is introduced as a measure of the total entanglement of the system with respect to the chosen basis and it is shown that its minimum over all bases of $\mathcal H$ is a function of the one-body density matrix. Furthermore, we show that if minimization is extended to all bases related through a Bogoliubov transformation, then the entanglement entropy is a function of the generalized one-body density matrix. These results are then used to quantify entanglement in fermion systems with four single-particle levels. For general pure states of such a system a closed expression for the fermionic concurrence is derived, which generalizes the Slater correlation measure defined in [J. Schliemann et al, Phys. Rev. A 64, 022303 (2001)], implying that "particle entanglement" may be seen as minimum "mode entanglement". It is also shown that the entanglement entropy defined before is related to this concurrence by an expression analogous to that of the two-qubit case. For mixed states of this system the convex roof extension of the previous concurrence and entanglement entropy are evaluated analytically, extending the results of previous ref. to general states.

However, the uncertainty relation is usually applied to two incompatible measurements. We present tighter bounds on both entropic uncertainty relation and information exclusion principle for multiple measurements in the presence of quantum memory. As applications, three incompatible measurements on Werner state and Horodecki's bound entangled state are investigated in details.

abstract: We analyze the photon statistics of a weakly driven cavity quantum electrodynamics system and discuss the effects of photon blockade and photon-induced tunneling by effectively utilizing instead of avoiding the center-of-mass motion of a two-level atom trapped in the cavity. With the resonant interaction between atom, photon and phonon, it is shown that the bunching and anti-bunching of photons can occur with properly driving frequency. Our study shows the influence of the imperfect cooling of atom on the blockade and provides an attempt to take advantage of the center-of-mass motion.

However, we can show that so does every original type non-contextuality inequality, especially the SIC ones. Here we take YO-13-ray [3] and KCBS inequality [4] for example.

abstract: One of Feynman's greatest contributions to physics was the interpretation of negative energies as antimatter in quantum field theory. A key component of this interpretation is the Feynman propagator, which seeks to describe the behavior of antimatter at the virtual particle level. Ironically, it turns out that one can dispense with the Feynman propagator in a direct-action theory of fields, while still retaining the interpretation of negative energy solutions as antiparticles.

abstract: When an atom is strongly coupled to a cavity, the two systems can exchange a single photon through a coherent Rabi oscillation. This process enables precise quantum-state engineering and manipulation of atoms and photons in a cavity, which play a central role in quantum information and measurement. Recently, a new regime of cavity QED has been reached experimentally where the strength of the interaction between light and artificial atoms (qubits) becomes comparable to the atomic transition frequency or the resonance frequency of the cavity mode. Here we show that this regime can strongly modify the concept of vacuum Rabi oscillations, enabling multiphoton exchanges between the qubit and the resonator. We find that experimental state-of-the-art circuit- QED systems can undergo two- and three-photon vacuum Rabi oscillations. These anomalous Rabi oscillations can be exploited for the realization of efficient Fock-state sources of light and complex entangled states of qubits.

abstract: Non-linearity of the current-phase relationship of a Josephson junction is the key resource for a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA), the only device in which the quantum limit has so far been achieved at microwave frequencies. A standard approach to describe JPA takes into account only the lowest order (cubic) non-linearity resulting in a Duffing-like oscillator equation of motion or in a Kerr-type non-linearity term in the Hamiltonian. In this paper we derive the quantum expression for the gain of JPA including all orders of the Josephson junction non-linearity in the linear response regime. We then analyse gain saturation effect for stronger signals within semi-classical approach. Our results reveal non-linear effects of higher orders and their implications for operation of a JPA.

abstract: Fast control of quantum systems is essential in order to make use of quantum properties before they are degraded by decoherence. This is important for quantum-enhanced information processing, as well as for pushing quantum systems into macroscopic regimes at the boundary between quantum and classical physics. Bang-bang control attains the ultimate speed limit by making large changes to control fields on timescales much faster than the system can respond, however these methods are often challenging to implement experimentally. Here we demonstrate bang-bang control of a trapped-ion oscillator using nano-second switching of the trapping potentials. We perform controlled displacements which allow us to realize quantum states with up to 10,000 quanta of energy. We use these displaced states to verify the form of the ion-light interaction at high excitations which are far outside the usual regime of operation. These methods provide new possibilities for quantum-state manipulation and generation, alongside the potential for a significant increase in operational clock speed for ion-trap quantum information processing.

abstract: Many-qubit entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing although its exploitation is hindered by the detrimental effects of the environment surrounding the many-qubit system. It is thus of importance to study the dynamics of general multipartite nonclassical correlation, including but not restricted to entanglement, under noise. We did this study for four-qubit GHZ state under most common noises in an experiment and found that nonclassical correlation is more robust than entanglement except when it is imposed to dephasing channel. Quantum discord presents a sudden transition in its dynamics for Pauli-X and Pauli-Y noises as well as Bell-diagonal states interacting with dephasing reservoirs and it decays monotonically for Pauli-Z and isotropic noises.

abstract: Quantum advantage is notoriously hard to find and even harder to prove. For example the class of functions computable with classical physics actually exactly coincides with the class computable quantum-mechanically. It is strongly believed, but not proven, that quantum computing provides exponential speed-up for a range of problems, such as factoring. Here we address a computational scenario of "randomness processing" in which quantum theory provably yields, not only resource reduction over classical stochastic physics, but a strictly larger class of problems which can be solved. Beyond new foundational insights into the nature and malleability of randomness, and the distinction between quantum and classical information, these results also offer the potential of developing classically intractable simulations with currently accessible quantum technologies.

The a posteriori evolution of the system is conditioned by the results of a single or double homodyne measurements. The system interacting with the Bose field is a single cavity mode taken initially in a Gaussian state. We show explicit solutions using the method of characteristic functions to the filtering equations exploiting the linear Gaussian nature of the problem.

abstract: Teleportation is the most widely discussed application of the basic principles of quantum mechanics. Fundamentally, this process describes the transmission of information, which involves transport of neither matter nor energy. The implicit assumption, however, is that this scheme is of inherently nonlocal nature, and therefore exclusive to quantum systems. Here, we show that the concept can be readily generalized beyond the quantum realm. We present an optical implementation of the teleportation protocol solely based on classical entanglement between spatial and modal degrees of freedom, entirely independent of nonlocality. Our findings could enable novel methods for distributing information between different transmission channels and may provide the means to leverage the advantages of both quantum and classical systems to create a robust hybrid communication infrastructure.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.06289
abstract: Abstract When quantum heat engines or refrigerators operate in the over-thermalization regime, quantum effects are not expected as the thermal baths eliminates all coherences. In this work we show that even in this seemingly non-quantum regime, it is possible to harvest coherence before it is erased, and obtain non classical effects. While the engine is not affected by the coherence harvesting, the extracted coherence can be used to cool external particles and reduce their entropy (the energy of the auxiliary particles is not modified). On top of cooling the extracted coherence can activate passive states. Coherence extraction also has an impact on the basic theory of heat machines. With coherence extraction, the standard expression for the total entropy production -Qc/Tc-Qh/Th is replaced by a simple relative entropy expression, that is orders of magnitude smaller in the regime of interest. Consequently, coherence extraction enables reversibility that is otherwise impossible. In addition, we present a collective engine operation scheme where coherence is recycled and shared between engines. This leads to an interesting performance boost where the total power scales quadratically with the number of engines, rather than linearly. Finally, a scheme for resource accounting is presented. It is demonstrated that coherence extraction and coherence injection extend the scope of known quantum thermal machines and add new modes of operation.

abstract: In this article we argue that thermal reservoirs (baths) are potentially useful resources in processes involving atoms interacting with quantized electromagnetic fields and their applications to quantum technologies. One may try to suppress the bath effects by means of dynamical control, but such control does not always yield the desired results. We wish instead to take advantage of bath effects, that do not obliterate "quantumness" in the system-bath compound. To this end, three possible approaches have been pursued by us: (i) Control of a quantum system faster than the correlation time of the bath to which it couples: Such control allows us to reveal quasi-reversible/coherent dynamical phenomena of quantum open systems, manifest by the quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effects (QZE or AZE, respectively). Dynamical control methods based on the QZE are aimed not only at protecting the quantumness of the system, but also diagnosing the bath spectra or transferring quantum information via noisy media. By contrast, AZE-based control is useful for fast cooling of thermalized quantum systems. (ii) Engineering the coupling of quantum systems to selected bath modes: This approach, based on field -atom coupling control in cavities, waveguides and photonic band structures, allows to drastically enhance the strength and range of atom-atom coupling through the mediation of the selected bath modes. More dramatically, it allows us to achieve bath-induced entanglement that may appear paradoxical if one takes the conventional view that coupling to baths destroys quantumness. (iii) Engineering baths with appropriate non-flat spectra: This approach is a prerequisite for the construction of the simplest and most efficient quantum heat machines (engines and refrigerators). We may thus conclude that often thermal baths are "more friends than foes" in quantum technologies.

The pump governing the upconversion process is produced and utilized inside the physical receiver, making its access or control unrealistic for an external adversary (Eve). This pump facilitates several properties which permit Bob to define and control the modes that can participate in the quantum measurement. Furthermore, by manipulating and monitoring the characteristics of the pump pulses, Bob can detect a wide range of quantum hacking attacks launched by Eve.

abstract: Hastings established exponential decay of correlations for ground states of gapped quantum many-body systems. A ground state of a (geometrically) local Hamiltonian with spectral gap $\epsilon$ has correlation length $\xi$ upper bounded as $\xi=O(1/\epsilon)$. In general this bound cannot be improved. Here we study the scaling of the correlation length as a function of the spectral gap in frustration-free local Hamiltonians, and we prove a tight bound $\xi=O(1/\sqrt\epsilon)$ in this setting. This highlights a fundamental difference between frustration-free and frustrated systems near criticality. The result is obtained using an improved version of the combinatorial proof of correlation decay due to Aharonov et al.

abstract: We have recently developed a quantized fluctuational electrodynamics (QFED) formalism to describe the quantum aspects of local thermal balance formation and to formulate the electromagnetic field ladder operators so that they no longer exhibit the anomalies reported for resonant structures. Here we show how the QFED can be used to resolve between the left and right propagating fields to bridge the QFED and the quantum optical input-output relations commonly used to describe selected quantum aspects of resonators. The generalized model introduces a density of states concept describing interference effects, which is instrumental in allowing an unambiguous separation of the fields and related quantum operators into left and right propagating parts. In addition to providing insight on the quantum treatment of interference, our results also provide the conclusive resolution of the long-standing enigma of the anomalous commutation relations of partially confined propagating fields.

abstract: A universal approach to decoherence control combined with quantum estimation theory reveals a critical behavior, akin to a phase transition, of the information obtainable by a qubit probe concerning the memory time of environmental fluctuations. This criticality emerges only when the probe is subject to dynamical control. It gives rise to a sharp transition between two dynamical phases characterized by either a short or long memory time compared to the probing time. This phase-transition of the environmental information is a fundamental feature that facilitates the attainment of the highest estimation precision of the environment memory-time and the characterization of probe dynamics.

abstract: We investigate unitary operators acting on a tensor product space, with the property that the quantum channels they generate, via the Stinespring dilation theorem, are of a particular type, independently of the state of the ancilla system in the Stinespring relation. The types of quantum channels we consider are those of interest in quantum information theory: unitary conjugations, constant channels, unital channels, mixed unitary channels, PPT channels, and entanglement breaking channels. For some of the classes of bipartite unitary operators corresponding to the above types of channels, we provide explicit characterizations, necessary and/or sufficient conditions for membership, and we compute the dimension of the corresponding algebraic variety. Inclusions between these classes are considered, and we show that for small dimensions, many of these sets are identical.

The energy surfaces are plotted numerically from the known analytic solution. The resulting energy landscape consists of an infinite stack of sheets connected by conical intersection points located at the degenerate Juddian points in the eigenspectrum. Trajectories encircling these points are expected to exhibit a nonzero geometric phase.

abstract: The quantum marginal problem asks whether a set of given density matrices are consistent, i.e., whether they can be the reduced density matrices of a global quantum state. Not many non-trivial analytic necessary (or sufficient) conditions are known for the problem in general. We propose a method to detect consistency of overlapping quantum marginals by considering the separability of some derived states. Our method works well for the $k$-symmetric extension problem in general, and for the general overlapping marginal problems in some cases. Our work is, in some sense, the converse to the well-known $k$-symmetric extension criterion for separability.

abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy ensembles promise an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and resolution for magnetic field sensing under ambient conditions. However, their full sensing potential is limited by the inhomogeneous degradation of their collective coherence, while dynamical-decoupling limits sensing to the detection of AC-fields. Here we propose using the recently demonstrated cavity-protection effect for room-temperature, ensemble-based DC metrology. We identify a parameter space where strong-coupling can persist at room temperature and where the dressed states are limited solely by the dephasing of the cavity mode and the ensemble longitudinal relaxation, showing aT Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ DC-field sensitivities to be theoretically achievable with further augmentation through Fano-interference.

abstract: Quantum information processing will require combinations of gate operations and communication, with each applied in parallel to large numbers of quantum systems. These tasks are often performed sequentially, with gates implemented by pulsed fields and information transported either by moving the physical qubits or using photonic links. For trapped ions, an alternative approach is to implement quantum logic gates by transporting the ions through static laser beams, combining qubit operations with transport. This has significant advantages for scalability since the voltage waveforms required for transport can potentially be generated using micro-electronics integrated into the trap structure itself, while both optical and microwave control elements are significantly more bulky. Using a multi-zone ion trap, we demonstrate transport gates on a qubit encoded in the hyperfine structure of a beryllium ion. We show the ability to perform sequences of operations, and to perform parallel gates on two ions transported through separate trap locations using a single recycled laser beam. For the latter, we demonstrate independent quantum gates by controlling the speed of each of the ions. This work provides a scalable path to ion trap quantum computing without a dramatic increase in optical control complexity.

abstract: Compatibility of symmetric quantization of the Dirac equation in a curved space with general covariance gives a special representation of the spin connections in which their dot product with the Dirac gamma matrices becomes equal to the "covariant divergence" of the latter. Requiring that the square of the equation gives the conventional Klein-Gordon equation in a curved space results in an operator algebra for the Dirac gamma matrices that involves the "covariant derivative" connections and the Riemann-Christoffel connections. In 1+1 space-time with static metric, we obtain exact solutions of this Dirac equation model for some examples. We also formulate the interacting theory of the model with various coupling modes and solve it in the same space for a given potential configuration.

abstract: Most current methods in quantum tomography do not provide a well-justified error analysis. Promising recent methods based on confidence regions are difficult to apply in practice or yield error bars which are unnecessarily large. Here, we propose a practical yet robust method for obtaining error bars. Our analysis is done in terms of a figure of merit such as the fidelity to a reference state. Our numerical method produces a particular histogram which is fitted by a theoretical model, and from which confidence regions for any confidence level can be constructed. We apply our procedure to a simulated example as well as to actual experimental data obtained from two superconducting qubits in an entangled state. The obtained error bars are of reasonable size. Finally, we introduce a new software project implementing our method.

abstract: Unlike mathematics, in which the notion of truth might be abstract, in physics, the emphasis must be placed on algorithmic procedures for obtaining numerical results subject to the experimental verifiability. For, a physical science is exactly that: algorithmic procedures (built on a certain mathematical formalism) for obtaining verifiable conclusions from a set of basic hypotheses. By admitting non-constructivist statements a physical theory loses its concrete applicability and thus verifiability of its predictions. Accordingly, the requirement of constructivism must be indispensable to any physical theory. Nevertheless, in at least some physical theories, and especially in quantum mechanics, one can find examples of non-constructive statements. The present paper demonstrates a couple of such examples dealing with macroscopic quantum states (i.e., with the applicability of the standard quantum formalism to macroscopic systems). As it is shown, in these examples the proofs of the existence of macroscopic quantum states are based on logical principles allowing one to decide the truth of predicates over an infinite number of things.

The procedure, which we demonstrate experimentally, allows for teleporting input polarisation states into output transverse beam modes. The role of the required ancillary system is played by the longitudinal mode inside an interferometer. As in the usual one-qubit teleportation setting, four different outputs are obtained, and the spin-orbit mode transfer is accomplished by local unitary operations conditioned on Bell measurement outcomes.

abstract: Traditional quantum error-correcting codes are designed for the depolarizing channel modeled by generalized Pauli errors occurring with equal probability. Amplitude damping channels model, in general, the decay process of a multilevel atom or energy dissipation of a bosonic system at zero temperature. We discuss quantum error-correcting codes adapted to amplitude damping channels for higher dimensional systems (qudits). For multi-level atoms, we consider a natural kind of decay process, and for bosonic systems,we consider the qudit amplitude damping channel obtained by truncating the Fock basis of the bosonic modes to a certain maximum occupation number. We construct families of single-error-correcting quantum codes that can be used for both cases. Our codes have larger code dimensions than the previously known single-error-correcting codes of the same lengths. Additionally, we present families of multi-error correcting codes for these two channels, as well as generalizations of our construction technique to error-correcting codes for the qutrit $V$ and $\Lambda$ channels.

abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we study the dynamics of a static polarizable two-level atom interacting with a bath of fluctuating vacuum electromagnetic field and explore under which conditions the coherence of the open quantum system is unaffected by the environment totally. For both a single-qubit and two-qubit systems, we find that the quantum coherence can not be protected from noise when the atom interacts with a non-boundary electromagnetic field. However, with the presence of a boundary, the dynamical conditions for the insusceptible of quantum coherence are fulfilled only when the atom is close to the boundary and is transversely polarizable. Otherwise, the quantum coherence can only be protected in some degree in other polarizable direction.

This extends the class of known exceptional configurations; until now the only known such configuration was the "diagonal construction" by Ambainis and Rivosh [AR08]

abstract: The Laguerre-Gauss modes are a class of fundamental and well-studied optical fields. These stable, shape-invariant photons - exhibiting circular-cylindrical symmetry - are familiar from laser optics, micro-mechanical manipulation, quantum optics, communication, and foundational studies in both classical optics and quantum physics. They are characterized, chiefly, by two modes numbers: the azimuthal index indicating the orbital angular momentum of the beam - which itself has spawned a burgeoning and vibrant sub-field - and the radial index, which up until recently, has largely been ignored. In this manuscript we develop a differential operator formalism for dealing with the radial modes in both the position and momentum representations, and - more importantly - give for the first time the meaning of this quantum number in terms of a well-defined physical parameter: the "intrinsic hyperbolic momentum charge".

abstract: No-go theorems assert that hidden-variable theories, subject to appropriate hypotheses, cannot reproduce the predictions of quantum theory. We examine two species of such theorems, value no-go theorems and expectation no-go theorems. The former assert that hidden-variables cannot match the predictions of quantum theory about the possible values resulting from measurements; the latter assert that hidden-variables cannot match the predictions of quantum theory about the expectation values of measurements. We sharpen the known results of both species, which allows us to clarify the similarities and differences between the two species. We also repair some flaws in existing definitions and proofs.

abstract: We investigate a semiconductor quantum dot as a microscopic analog of a basic optomechanical setup. We show, that optomechanical features can be reproduced by the solid-state platform, arising from parallels of the underlying interaction processes, which in the optomechanical case is the radiation pressure coupling and in the semiconductor case the electron-phonon coupling. In optomechanics, phonons are typically induced via confined photons, acting on a movable mirror, while in the semiconductor system the phonons are emitted by the laser-driven electronic system. There are analogous effects present for both systems, featuring bistabilities, optically induced phonon lasing and enhanced phonon loss. Nonetheless, the different statistical nature of the optical cavity and the electronic system also leads to qualitative differences.

abstract: We study the local indistinguishability of mutually orthogonal product basis quantum states in the high-dimensional quantum system. In the quantum system of $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^d$, where $d$ is odd, Zhang \emph{et al} have constructed $d^2$ orthogonal product basis quantum states which are locally indistinguishable in [Phys. Rev. A. {\bf 90}, 022313(2014)]. We find a subset contains with $6d-9$ orthogonal product states which are still locally indistinguishable. Then we generalize our method to arbitrary bipartite quantum system $\mathbb{C}^m\otimes\mathbb{C}^n$. We present a small set with only $3(m+n)-9$ orthogonal product states and prove these states are LOCC indistinguishable. Even though these $3(m+n)-9$ product states are LOCC indistinguishable, they can be distinguished by separable measurements. This shows that separable operations are strictly stronger than the local operations and classical communication.

Detailed examples are presented to compare among our results with some existing ones.

abstract: We introduce the quantum differential stochastic equation (QSDE) approach to exactly analyze of the response of quantum systems to a continuous-mode two-photon input. The QSDE description of the two-photon process allows us to integrate the input-output analysis with the quantum network theory, and so the analytical computability of the output state of a general quantum system can be addressed within this framework. We show that the time-domain two-photon output states can be exactly calculated for a large class of quantum systems including passive linear networks, optomechanical oscillators and two-level emitter in waveguide systems. In particular, we propose to utilize the results for the exact simulation of the stimulated emission as well as the study of the scattering of two-mode photon wave packets.

abstract: A system comprising a $\Lambda$-type or V-type atom interacting with two radiation fields exhibits, during its dynamical evolution, interesting optical phenomena such as electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and a variety of nonclassical effects. Signatures of the latter are seen in the entanglement dynamics of the atomic subsystem and in appropriate field observables. Some of these effects have been experimentally detected, and have even been used to change the nonlinear optical properties of certain atomic media. It is therefore useful to investigate the roles played by specific initial states of the radiation fields, detuning parameters, field nonlinearities and the nature of field-atom couplings on EIT and on the entanglement between subsystems. We investigate these aspects in the framework of a simple model that captures the salient features of such tripartite entangled systems. Entanglement dynamics is shown to be very sensitive to the intensity-dependent atom-field couplings. Unexpected interesting features pertaining to the collapses and revivals of the atomic subsystem von Neumann entropy appear. These features could, in principle, be useful in enabling entanglement.

abstract: In 1940 Naimark showed that if a set of quantum observables are positive semi-definite and sum to the identity then, on a larger space, they have a joint resolution as commuting projectors. In 1955 Sz.-Nagy showed that any set of observables could be so resolved, with the resolution respecting all linear sums. Crucially, both resolutions return the correct Born probabilities for the original observables. Here, an alternative proof of the Sz.-Nagy result is given using elementary inner product spaces. A version of the resolution is then shown to respect all products of observables on the base space. Practical and theoretical consequences are indicated. For example, quantum statistical inference problems that involve any algebraic functionals can now be studied using classical statistical methods over commuting observables. The estimation of quantum states is a problem of this type. Further, as theoretical objects, classical and quantum systems are now distinguished by only more or less degrees of freedom.

abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum systems subject to magnetic fields is of fundamental importance and underpins quantum technologies. However, modeling these systems is a complex task, because of many-body interactions and because many-body approaches such as density functional theory get complicated by the presence of a vector potential into the system Hamiltonian. We use the metric space approach to quantum mechanics to study the effects of varying the magnetic vector potential on quantum systems. The application of this technique to model systems in the ground state provides insight into the fundamental mapping at the core of current density functional theory, which relates the many-body wavefunction, particle density and paramagnetic current density. We show that the role of the paramagnetic current density in this relationship becomes crucial when considering states with different magnetic quantum numbers, $m$. Additionally, varying the magnetic field uncovers a richer complexity for the "band structure" present in ground state metric spaces, as compared to previous studies varying scalar potentials. The robust nature of the metric space approach is strengthened by demonstrating the gauge invariance of the related metric for the paramagnetic current density. We go beyond ground state properties and apply this approach to excited states. The results suggest that, under specific conditions, a universal behavior may exist for the relationships between the physical quantities defining the system.

abstract: The standard formulation of Quantum Mechanics violates locality of interactions and the action reaction principle. An alternative formulation in an extended phase space could preserve both principles, but Bell's theorems show that a distribution of probability in a space of local variables can not reproduce the quantum correlations. An extended phase space is defined in an alternative formulation of Quantum Mechanics. Quantum states are represented by a complex va\-lued distribution of amplitude, so that Bell's theorems do not apply.

abstract: We study the evolution of the hybrid entangled states in a bipartite (ultra) strongly coupled qubit-oscillator system. Using the generalized rotating wave approximation the reduced density matrices of the qubit and the oscillator are obtained. The reduced density matrix of the oscillator yields the phase space quasi probability distributions such as the diagonal P-representation, the Wigner W-distribution and the Husimi Q-function. In the strong coupling regime the Q-function evolves to uniformly separated macroscopically distinct Gaussian peaks representing 'kitten' states at certain specified times that depend on multiple time scales present in the interacting system. For the ultra-strong coupling realm a large number of interaction-generated modes arise with a complete randomization of their phases. A stochastic averaging of the dynamical quantities sets in while leading to the decoherence of the system. The delocalization in the phase space of the oscillator is studied by using the Wehrl entropy. The negativity of the W-distribution, while registering its departure from the classical states, allows us to compare the information-theoretic measures such as the Wehrl entropy with the Wigner entropy. Other features of nonclassicality such as the existence of the squeezed states and appearance of negative values of the Mandel parameter are realized during the course of evolution of the bipartite system. In the parametric regime studied here these properties do not survive after a time-averaging process.

abstract: The time evolution of a closed quantum system is connected to its Hamiltonian through Schroedinger's equation. The ability to estimate the Hamiltonian is critical to our understanding of quantum systems, and allows optimization of control. Though spectroscopic methods allow time-independent Hamiltonians to be recovered, for time-dependent Hamiltonians this task is more challenging. Here, using a single trapped ion, we experimentally demonstrate a method for estimating a time-dependent Hamiltonian of a single qubit. The method involves measuring the time evolution of the qubit in a fixed basis as a function of a time-independent offset term added to the Hamiltonian. In our system the initially unknown Hamiltonian arises from transporting an ion through a static, near-resonant laser beam. Hamiltonian estimation allows us to estimate the spatial dependence of the laser beam intensity and the ion's velocity as a function of time. This work is of direct value in optimizing transport operations and transport-based gates in scalable trapped ion quantum information processing, while the estimation technique is general enough that it can be applied to other quantum systems, aiding the pursuit of high operational fidelities in quantum control.

This implies that, on a fundamental level, it is impossible to discriminate a private communication from an exchange of photographs.

In physical implementations of the walk, however, the particle may need to tunnel through a potential barrier to hop, and a naive calculation suggests this could eliminate the ballistic transport. We show by explicit calculation, however, that such a loss does not occur. Rather, the $\Theta(t)$ dispersion is retained, with only the coefficient changing, which additionally gives a way to detect and quantify the hopping errors in experiments.

abstract: The data processing inequality states that the quantum relative entropy between two states can never increase by applying the same quantum channel to both states. This inequality can be strengthened with a remainder term in the form of a distance to the closest recovered state whereas the action of the channel is perfectly reversed on the second state. We show the existence of an explicit recovery map that is universal in the sense that it only depends on the second state and the quantum channel to be reversed.

abstract: The demonstration and use of nonlocality, as defined by Bell's theorem, rely strongly on dealing with non-detection events due to losses and detectors' inefficiencies. Otherwise, the so-called detection loophole could be exploited. The only way to avoid this is to have detection efficiencies that are above a certain threshold. We introduce the intermediate assumption of limited detection efficiency, that is, in each run of the experiment, the overall detection efficiency is lower bounded by $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an adversarial scenario, the adversaries have arbitrary large but not full control over the inefficiencies. We analyse the set of possible correlations that fulfill Limited Detection Locality (LDL) and show that they necessarily satisfy some linear Bell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts the violation of one of these inequalities for all $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, nonlocality can be demonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection efficiencies. We validate this assumption experimentally via a twin-photon implementation in which two users are provided with one photon each out of a partially entangled pair. We exploit on each side a passive switch followed by two measurement devices with fixed settings. Assuming the switches are not fully controlled by an adversary, nor by hypothetical local variables, we reveal the nonlocality of the established correlations despite a low overall detection efficiency.

A series of no-go theorems which exclude channels from being reachable, and an expression for the required evolution time, are given by considering noisy dynamics as an anisotropic flow in state space. As well as studying examples of the strength of these criteria in control theory, we explore their relation with existing approaches and links with quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: Witnessing continuous-variable Bell nonlocality is a challenging endeavor, but Bell himself showed how one might demonstrate this nonlocality. Though Bell showed a qualitiative violation using the CHSH inequality with sign-binned position-momentum statistics of entangled pairs of particles measured at different times, his demonstration is subject to an approximation that is not realizable in a laboratory setting. Moreover, he doesn't give a quantitative estimation of the maximum achievable violation for the wavefunction he considers. In this article, we show how his strategy can be reimagined using the transverse positions and momenta of entangled photon pairs measured at different propagation distances, and we find that the maximum achievable violation for the state he considers is actually very small relative to the upper limit of $2\sqrt{2}$. Although Bell's wavefunction does not produce a large violation of the CHSH inequality, other states may yet do so.

We present an explicit protocol to get the the weak values in a simple Mach-Zehnder interferometer model and derive the formulae for the weak values in terms of the experimental data consisting of the positions and momenta of detected photons on the basis of the quantum Bayes relation. The formula gives a way of tomography of the initial state almost without disturbing it in the weak coupling limit.

The Lyapunov stability formalism proposed in this paper can be conveniently embedded into the framework of quantum computation and state engineering by dissipation control, where the task is to stabilize the ground state. We focus on a specific decomposition of the dissipation control, for which the scalability conditions of the Lyapunov method can be derived. Also we will show that the Lyapunov formalism is implicitly related to the stabilizer formalism for quantum error correction, in the sense that the dissipation control can be used for passive error correction in addition to stabilization.

abstract: This paper investigates the power of polynomial-time quantum computation in which only a very limited number of qubits are initially clean in the |0> state, and all the remaining qubits are initially in the totally mixed state. No initializations of qubits are allowed during the computation, nor intermediate measurements. The main results of this paper are unexpectedly strong error-reducible properties of such quantum computations. It is proved that any problem solvable by a polynomial-time quantum computation with one-sided bounded error that uses logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially small one-sided error using just two clean qubits, and with polynomially small one-sided error using just one clean qubit. It is further proved in the case of two-sided bounded error that any problem solvable by such a computation with a constant gap between completeness and soundness using logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially small two-sided error using just two clean qubits. If only one clean qubit is available, the problem is again still solvable with exponentially small error in one of the completeness and soundness and polynomially small error in the other. As an immediate consequence of the above result for the two-sided-error case, it follows that the TRACE ESTIMATION problem defined with fixed constant threshold parameters is complete for the classes of problems solvable by polynomial-time quantum computations with completeness 2/3 and soundness 1/3 using logarithmically many clean qubits and just one clean qubit. The techniques used for proving the error-reduction results may be of independent interest in themselves, and one of the technical tools can also be used to show the hardness of weak classical simulations of one-clean-qubit computations (i.e., DQC1 computations).

abstract: Quantum capacity, as the ultimate transmission rate of quantum communication, is characterized by regularized coherent information. In this work, we reformulate approximations of the quantum capacity by operator space norms and give both upper and lower bounds on quantum capacity, and potential quantum capacity using interpolation techniques. We identify a situation in which nice classes of channels satisfy a "comparison property" on entropy, coherent information and capacities. The paradigms for our estimates are so-called conditional expectations. These generally non-degradable channels admit a strongly additive expression for $Q^{(1)}$. We also identify conditions on channels showing that the "hashing bound" is optimal for the cb-entropy. These two estimates combined give upper and lower bounds on quantum capacity on our "nice" classes of channels, which differ only up to a factor 2, independent of the dimension. The estimates are discussed for certain classes of channels, including group channels, Pauli channels and other high-dimensional channels.

In this paper, we derive the GUP corrections to the tunneling probability of simple quantum mechanical systems which are accessible to undergraduates (alpha decay, simple models of quantum cosmogenesis and gravitational tunneling radiation) and which employ the WKB approximation, a topic discussed in undergraduate quantum mechanics classes. It is shown that the GUP correction increases the tunneling probability in each of the examples discussed.

The analysis indicates, however, that retrocausal influences must be involved.

The degeneracy complicates the question, whether or not a stationary current through such a system can be established, i.e.\ whether or not the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric states are stable. It is shown that this is only the case for perturbations that do not couple to any of the degenerate states. The physical explanation for the inhibition of stable currents is discussed. However, introducing an on-site interaction restores the capability to support stable currents.

abstract: Secure random numbers are a fundamental element of many applications in science, statistics, cryptography and more in general in security protocols. We present a method that enables the generation of high-speed unpredictable random numbers from the quadratures of an electromag- netic field without any assumption on the input state. The method allows to eliminate the numbers that can be predict due the presence of classical and quantum side information. In particular, we introduce a procedure to estimate a bound on the conditional min-entropy based on the Entropic Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum observables of infinite dimensional quantum sys- tems. By the above method, we experimentally demonstrated the generation of secure true random bits at a rate greater than 1 Gbit/s.

abstract: The search for a simple description of fundamental physical processes is an important part of quantum theory. One example for such an abstraction can be found in the distance lab paradigm: if two separated parties are connected via a classical channel, it is notoriously difficult to characterize all possible operations these parties can perform. This class of operations is widely known as local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Surprisingly, the situation becomes comparably simple if the more general class of separable operations is considered, a finding which has been extensively used in quantum information theory for many years. Here, we propose a related approach for the resource theory of quantum coherence, where two distant parties can only perform measurements which do not create coherence and can communicate their outcomes via a classical channel. We call this class local incoherent operations and classical communication (LICC). While the characterization of this class is also difficult in general, we show that the larger class of separable incoherent operations (SI) has a simple mathematical form, yet still preserving the main features of LICC. We apply these results to the task of assisted coherence distillation, where the aim is to locally extract maximally coherent states. For all pure states and certain mixed states we observe a collapse of all classes: the distillation rate is always the same. It remains open if the distillation rate can be different for general mixed states, and if the intersection of LOCC and SI is equivalent to LICC. We also introduce the task of incoherent teleportation and show that perfect incoherent teleportation of one qubit is possible with one singlet and two bits of classical communication. The approach presented here opens new ways to study the resource theory of coherence in distributed scenarios.

abstract: Recent advances have been made in constructing a resource theory of quantum coherence that closely resembles the resource theory of entanglement. In this paper, we attempt to unify both approaches by considering the operational setting of local incoherent operations and classical communication (LIOCC). In this setting, both entanglement and coherence are resources, and we analyze their trade-offs in the tasks of state formation and resource distillation. We find that the entanglement cost for generating a given bipartite state is the same under LIOCC operations as when the parties are not restricted to incoherent operations. Similarly, we show that entanglement can be distilled from a bipartite pure state at a rate of the reduced-state entropy using LIOCC. Finally, a bipartite mixed state is shown to have distillable entanglement if and only if entanglement can be distilled by LIOCC. Thus, in the long-standing search for NPT bound entanglement, it suffices to just consider local incoherent operations and classical communication.

abstract: In this work we analyze the validity of Lifshitz's theory for the case of non-equilibrium scenarios from a full quantum dynamical approach. We show that Lifshitz's framework for the study of the Casimir pressure is the result of considering the long-time regime (or steady state) of a well-defined fully quantized problem, subjected to initial conditions for the electromagnetic field interacting with real materials. For this, we implement the closed time path formalism developed in previous works to study the case of two half spaces (modeled as composite environments, consisting in quantum degrees of freedom plus thermal baths) interacting with the electromagnetic field. Starting from initial uncorrelated free subsystems, we solve the full time evolution, obtaining general expressions for the different contributions to the pressure that take part on the transient stage. Using the analytic properties of the retarded Green functions, we obtain the long-time limit of these contributions to the total Casimir pressure. We show that, in the steady state, only the baths' contribute, in agreement with the results of previous works, where this was assumed without justification. We also study in detail the physics of the initial conditions' contribution and the concept of modified vacuum modes, giving insights about in which situations one would expect a non vanishing contribution at the steady state of a non-equilibrium scenario. This would be the case when considering finite width slabs instead of half-spaces.

abstract: Two major open problems regarding the parallel repetition of games are whether an analogue of Raz's parallel-repetition theorem holds for (a) games with more than two players, and (b) games with quantum players using entanglement. We make progress on both problems: we introduce a class of games we call anchored, and prove exponential-decay parallel repetition theorems for anchored games in the multiplayer and entangled-player settings. We introduce a simple transformation on games called anchoring and show that this transformation turns any game into an anchored game. Together, our parallel repetition theorem and our anchoring transformation provide a simple and efficient hardness-amplification technique in both the classical multiplayer and quantum settings.

abstract: Time-bin encoded photonic qubits are robust against decoherence in birefringent media such as optical fibers, which has led to many successful quantum communication demonstrations, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer-based system, plug-and-play quantum key distribution (QKD), differential phase shift (DPS) and coherent one-way (COW) protocols, quantum teleportation, and elements of quantum repeaters. Despite these successes, time-bin encoding is considered impractical for turbulent free-space or multimode fiber channels, because spatial and temporal mode distortions hinder the interference required for analysis of time-bin superposition states. Here we present an efficient time-bin qubit analyzer, assisted by passive relay optics, that matches the spatial mode of the interfering paths. Our system demonstrates interference visibility of 89 %, even for strongly distorted optical input modes emerging from multimode fiber under variable angles of incidence. We measure a high level of entanglement between a time-bin qubit and a separate polarization qubit, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of time-bin based quantum communication over optical multimodal links.

Small mass gap in the spectrum, consistent with other approaches is generated as long as the system is in the unbroken phase. Relativistic Landau levels are constructed explicitly for such a system.

While Turbiner and Escobar-Ruiz (2013) addressed the case of the Coulomb interaction between the particles, we explore three other potentials. We do this by reducing the appropriate Hamiltonians to the second-order polynomials in the generators of the representation of $SL(2,C)$ group in the differential form. This allows us to perform partial diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian, and to reduce the search for the first few energies and the corresponding wave functions to an algebraic procedure.

I close with a general discussion of the possible implications of this for our understanding of the limits of classical description, and for our understanding of the fundamental aim of physical investigation.

abstract: Measuring incomplete sets of mutually unbiased bases constitutes a sensible approach to the tomography of high-dimensional quantum systems. The unbiased nature of these bases optimizes the uncertainty hypervolume. However, imposing unbiasedness on the probabilities for the unmeasured bases does not generally yield the estimator with the largest von Neumann entropy, a popular figure of merit in this context. Furthermore, this imposition typically leads to mock density matrices that are not even positive definite. This provides a strong argument against perfunctory applications of linear estimation strategies. We propose to use instead the physical state estimators that maximize the Shannon entropy of the unmeasured outcomes, which quantifies our lack of knowledge fittingly and gives physically meaningful statistical predictions.

abstract: The concept of thermal equilibrium lies at the core of thermodynamics and it is characterised by the zeroth law of thermodynamics. Within the context of quantum statistical mechanics we can formulate this principle saying that the thermal equilibrium state is implicitly defined as the state which maximises von Neumann entropy. Such a choice of entropy does not take into account our ignorance about the observables under study, therefore we propose to investigate the thermodynamical meaning of Shannon's entropy. We propose an information-theoretic zeroth law, inspired by the ordinary zeroth law of thermodynamics and characterise the notion of thermal observable via the maximisation of its Shannon entropy.

abstract: By introducing concepts of beam shaping into quantum mechanics, we show how interference effects of the quantum wavefunction describing multiple electrons can exactly balance the repulsion among the electrons. With proper shaping of the fermionic wavefunction, we propose non-diffracting quantum wavepackets of multiple electrons that can also carry orbital angular momentum, in the form of multi-electron non-diffracting vortex beams. The wavefunction is designed to compensate for both the repulsion between electrons and for the diffraction-broadening. This wavefunction shaping facilitates the use of electron beams of higher current in numerous applications, thereby improving the signal-to-noise-ratio in electron microscopy and related systems without compromising on the spatial resolution. Our scheme potentially applies for any beams of charged particles, such as protons, muons and ion beams.

abstract: We have shown that it is possible to formulate the consistent and probability-preserving description of the $CP$-symmetry-violating evolution of a system of decaying particles. This has been done within the framework of quantum mechanics of open systems. This approach allows the description of both the exponential decay and flavour oscillations. We have solved explicitly the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation for a system of particles with violated $CP$ symmetry and found the evolution of _any_ observable bilinear in creation and annihilation operators. The choice of a concrete observable can be done by the proper choice of initial conditions for the system of differential equations. We have calculated the evolution as well as mean values of the observables most interesting from the physical point of view, and we have found their lowest order difference with the $CP$-preserved values.

abstract: How does statistical mechanics emerge in an isolated quantum system? Part of this question is addressed by a conjecture called Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), while the debate on the underlying dynamics remains unsettled. We scale a trapped-ion system to study a spin evolving in a Hilbert space of dimension up to $2^{22}$ by tuning its coupling to a discrete bosonic environment. Controlling external parameters, we increase the effective size of the system and experimentally test ETH predictions: Time averages of local spin observables come to agreement with microcanonical averages while corresponding fluctuations decay. We exploit that our approach features coherent control of all degrees of freedom of an isolated quantum system to study equilibration, thermalization and its dynamics on transient up to effectively infinite time scales.

abstract: A broad range of quantum optimisation problems can be phrased as the question whether a specific system has a ground state at zero energy, i.e. whether its Hamiltonian is frustration free. Frustration-free Hamiltonians, in turn, play a central role for constructing and understanding new phases of matter in quantum many-body physics. Unfortunately, determining whether this is the case is known to be a complexity-theoretically intractable problem. This makes it highly desirable to search for efficient heuristics and algorithms in order to, at least, partially answer this question. Here we prove a general criterion -- a sufficient condition -- under which a local Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be frustration free by lifting Shearer's theorem from classical probability theory to the quantum world. Remarkably, evaluating this condition proceeds via a fully classical analysis of a hard-core lattice gas at negative fugacity on the Hamiltonian's interaction graph which as a statistical mechanics problem is of interest in their own right. We concretely apply this criterion to local Hamiltonians on various regular lattices, while bringing to bear the tools of spin glass theory which permit us to obtain new bounds on the SAT/UNSAT transition in random quantum satisfiability. These also lead us to natural conjectures for when such bounds will be exact (tight), as well as to a novel notion of universality for these computer science problems. Besides providing concrete algorithms leading to detailed and quantitative insights, this underscores the power of marrying classical statistical mechanics with quantum computation and complexity theory.

abstract: We derive complementarity relations for arbitrary quantum states of multiparty systems, of arbitrary number of parties and dimensions, between the purity of a part of the system and several correlation quantities, including entanglement and other quantum correlations as well as classical and total correlations, of that part with the remainder of the system. We subsequently use such a complementarity relation, between purity and quantum mutual information in the tripartite scenario, to provide a bound on the secret key rate for individual attacks on a quantum key distribution protocol.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The network paradigm for quantum computing involves interconnecting many modules to form a scalable machine. Typically it is assumed that the links between modules are prone to noise while operations within modules have significantly higher fidelity. To optimise fault tolerance in such architectures we introduce a hierarchical generalisation of the surface code: a small `patch' of the code exists within each module, and constitutes a single effective qubit of the logic-level surface code. Errors primarily occur in a two-dimensional subspace, i.e. patch perimeters extruded over time, and the resulting noise threshold for inter-module links can exceed ~ 10% even in the absence of purification. Increasing the number of qubits within each module decreases the number of qubits necessary for encoding a logical qubit. But this advantage is relatively modest, and broadly speaking a `fine grained' network of small modules containing only ~ 8 qubits is competitive in total qubit count versus a `course' network with modules containing many hundreds of qubits.

abstract: We present an experimental realization of a quantum digital signature protocol which, together with a standard quantum key distribution link, increases transmission distance to kilometre ranges, three orders of magnitude larger than in previous realizations. The bit-rate is also significantly increased compared with previous quantum signature demonstrations. This work illustrates that quantum digital signatures can be realized with optical components similar to those used for quantum key distribution, and could be implemented in existing optical fiber networks.

abstract: We show that initially localized and uncorrelated two-particles quantum wavepackets evolving in a one-dimensional discrete lattice become strongly entangled while drifting under the action of an harmonic AC field resonant with doubled Bloch oscillations promoted by a static DC field. Although partial entanglement is achieved when the AC field is resonant with the single-particle Bloch oscillations, it is strongly limited by the survival of anti-correlated unbounded states. We further show that the phase dependence of the wavepacket centroid velocity is similar to the semiclassical behavior depicted by a single-particle. However, the drift velocity exhibits a non-trivial non-monotonic dependence on the interaction strength, vanishing in the limit of uncorrelated particles, that unveils its competing influence on unbounded and bounded states.

abstract: Observing quantum interference by moving terminals in Space is a great challenge and a necessary tool for testing Quantum Mechanics in an unexplored scenario. Here we experimentally demonstrate single photon interference due to a superposition of two temporal modes reflected by a rapidly moving satellite thousand kilometers away from the ground station. The relative speed of the satellite induces a varying modulation in the interference pattern. The measurement of the satellite distance in real time by laser ranging allowed us to precisely predict the instantaneous value of the interference phase. We observed the interference patterns with visibility up to 67% with three different satellites. Our results pave the way for quantum communication and tests of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity.

abstract: We analyze the constraints that causality imposes on some of the particle detector models employed in quantum field theory in general, and in particular on those used in quantum optics (or superconducting circuits) to model atoms interacting with light. Namely, we show that disallowing faster-than-light communication can impose severe constraints on the applicability of particle detector models in three different common scenarios: 1) when the detectors are spatially smeared, 2) when a UV cutoff is introduced in the theory and 3) under one of the most typical approximations made in quantum optics: the rotating-wave approximation. We identify in which scenarios the models' causal behaviour can be cured and in which it cannot.

abstract: Adiabatic or slowly varying gate operations are typically required in order to remain within the qubit subspace in an anharmonic oscillator. However significant speed ups are possible by using the two quadrature derivative-removal-by-adiabatic-gate(DRAG) technique, where a second time derivative pulse component burns a spectral hole near an unwanted transition. It is shown here, that simultaneous optimization of the detuning and the pulse norm in addition, further reduces leakage errors and significantly improve gate fidelities. However, with this optimization accounting for the AC Stark shift, there is a low spectral weight pulse envelope regime, where DRAG is almost not needed and where the two state error fidelities are stable against pulse jitter. Explicit time evolution calculations are carried out in the lab frame for truncated multi-level Transmon qubit models obtained from a tight-binding model.

abstract: Lasers have revolutionized optical science and technology, but their microwave counterpart, maser, has not realized its great potential due to its demanding work conditions (high-vacuum for gas maser and liquid-helium temperature for solid-state maser). Room-temperature solid-state maser is highly desirable, but under such conditions the lifetimes of emitters (usually electron spins) are usually too short (~ns) for population inversion. The only room-temperature solid-state maser is based on a pentacene-doped p-terphenyl crystal, which has long spin lifetime (~0.1 ms). This maser, however, operates only in the pulse mode and the material is unstable. Here we propose room-temperature maser based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond, which feature long spin lifetimes at room temperature (~10 ms), high optical pump efficiency, and material stability. We demonstrate that under readily accessible conditions, room-temperature diamond maser is feasible. Room-temperature diamond maser may facilitate a broad range of microwave technologies.

abstract: We present a twofold contribution to the numerical simulation of Lindblad equations. First, an adaptive numerical approach to approximate Lindblad equations using low-rank dynamics is described: a deterministic low-rank approximation of the density operator is computed, and its rank is adjusted dynamically, using an on-the-fly estimator of the error committed when reducing the dimension. On the other hand, when the intrinsic dimension of the Lindblad equation is too high to allow for such a deterministic approximation, we combine classical ensemble averages of quantum Monte Carlo trajectories and a denoising technique. Specifically, a variance reduction method based upon the consideration of a low-rank dynamics as a control variate is developed. Numerical tests for quantum collapse and revivals show the efficiency of each approach, along with the complementarity of the two approaches.

abstract: We study two-dimensional quantum Gaussian packets with a fixed value of mean angular momentum. This value is the sum of two independent parts: the `external' momentum related to the motion of the packet center and the `internal' momentum due to quantum fluctuations. The packets minimizing the mean energy of an isotropic oscillator with the fixed mean angular momentum are found. They exist for `co-rotating' external and internal motions, and they have nonzero correlation coefficients between coordinates and momenta, together with some (moderate) amount of quadrature squeezing. Variances of angular momentum and energy are calculated, too. Differences in the behavior of `co-rotating' and `anti-rotating' packets are shown. The time evolution of rotating Gaussian packets is analyzed, including the cases of a charge in a homogeneous magnetic field and a free particle. In the latter case, the effect of initial shrinking of packets with big enough coordinate-momentum correlation coefficients (followed by the well known expansion) is discovered. This happens due to a competition of `focusing' and `de-focusing' in the orthogonal directions.

abstract: We present a planar qubit design based on a superconducting circuit that we call concentric transmon. While employing a simple fabrication process using Al evaporation and lift-off lithography, we observe qubit lifetimes and coherence times in the order of 10us. We systematically characterize loss channels such as incoherent dielectric loss, Purcell decay and radiative losses. The implementation of a gradiometric SQUID loop allows for a fast tuning of the qubit transition frequency and therefore for full tomographic control of the quantum circuit. The presented qubit design features a passive direct Z coupling between neighboring qubits, being a pending quest in the field of quantum simulation.

abstract: A conventional optomechanical system is composed of a mechanical mode and an optical mode interacting through a linear optomechanical coupling (LOC). We study how the presence of quadratic optomechanical coupling (QOC) in the conventional optomechanical system affects the system's stability and optical quadrature squeezing. We work in the resolved side-band limit with a high quality factor mechanical oscillator. In contrast to the conventional optomechanical systems, we find that strong squeezing of the cavity field can be achieved in presence of QOC along with LOC at lower pump powers and at higher bath temperatures. Using detailed numerical calculations we also find that there exists an optimal QOC where one can achieve maximum squeezing.

abstract: We investigate the Casimir free energy of a metallic film either sandwiched between two dielectric plates or in vacuum. It is shown that even for a thin film of several tens of nanometer thickness the Casimir free energy and pressure calculated with the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the plasma model approaches take significantly different values and can be easily discriminated. According to our results, the classical limit is already achieved for films of about 100\,nm thickness if the Drude model approach is used in calculations. In this case the classical expressions for the Casimir free energy and pressure are common for both configurations considered. If the plasma model approach is used, the classical limit is not achieved for any film thickness. Instead, the Casimir free energy and pressure are decreasing exponentially to zero. When the plasma frequency goes to infinity, the Casimir free energy obtained using the Drude model approach goes to a nonzero limit in contradiction with expectations. If the plasma model approach is used the free energy of metallic film goes to zero in the limit of infinitely large plasma frequency. All analytic results are accompanied by numerical computations performed for a Au film and sapphire plates. The possibilities to observe the predicted effects discriminating between the Drude and plasma model approaches are discussed.

journal:

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08084
abstract: Using semiclassical methods, it is possible to construct very accurate approximations in the short wavelength limit of quantum dynamics that rely exclusively on classical dynamical input. For systems whose classical realization is strongly chaotic, there is an exceedingly short logarithmic Ehrenfest time scale, beyond which the quantum and classical dynamics of a system necessarily diverge, and yet the semiclassical construction remains valid far beyond that time. This fact leads to a paradox if one ponders the reversibility and predictability properties of quantum and classical mechanics. They behave very differently relative to each other, with classical dynamics being essentially irreversible/unpredictable, whereas quantum dynamics is reversible/stable. This begs the question, "how can an accurate approximation to a reversible/stable dynamics be constructed from an irreversible/unpredictable one?" The resolution of this incongruity depends on a couple key ingredients, a well-known, inherent, one-way structural stability of chaotic systems and an overlap integral not being amenable to the saddle point method.

abstract: We recently considered the task of summoning an unknown quantum state and proved necessary and sufficient conditions for Alice to be able to guarantee to complete the task when there may be several possible calls, of which she need only respond to one. We showed that these are strictly stronger conditions than those previously established by Hayden and May for the case where Alice knows there will only be one call. We introduced the concept of a {\it quantum paradox of choice} to summarize the implications of these results: Alice is given more options to complete our version of the task, yet one can easily construct examples where our version is impossible and the apparently simpler version considered by Hayden-May is possible. Finkelstein has argued that one can identify analogous classical paradoxes of choice in a relativistic setting. We examine Finkelstein's proposed classical tasks and explain why they seem to us disanalogous.

abstract: Quantum measurements are crucial to observe the properties of a quantum system, which however unavoidably perturb its state and dynamics in an irreversible way. Here we study the dynamics of a quantum system while being subject to a sequence of projective measurements applied at random times. In the case of independent and identically distributed intervals of time between consecutive measurements, we analytically demonstrate that the survival probability of the system to remain in the projected state assumes a large-deviation (exponentially decaying) form in the limit of an infinite number of measurements. This allows us to estimate the typical value of the survival probability, which can therefore be tuned by controlling the probability distribution of the random time intervals. Our analytical results are numerically tested for Zeno-protected entangled states, which also demonstrates that the presence of disorder in the measurement sequence further enhances the survival probability when the Zeno limit is not reached (as it happens in experiments). Our studies provide a new tool for protecting and controlling the amount of quantum coherence in open complex quantum systems by means of tunable stochastic measurements.

abstract: Security in quantum cryptography is continuously challenged by inventive attacks targeting the real components of a cryptographic setup, and duly restored by new counter-measures to foil them. Due to their high sensitivity and complex design, detectors are the most frequently attacked components. Recently it was shown that two-photon interference from independent light sources can be exploited to avoid the use of detectors at the two ends of the communication channel. This new form of detection-safe quantum cryptography, called Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MDI-QKD), has been experimentally demonstrated, but with modest delivered key rates. Here we introduce a novel pulsed laser seeding technique to obtain high-visibility interference from gain-switched lasers and thereby perform quantum cryptography without detector vulnerabilities with unprecedented bit rates, in excess of 1 Mb/s. This represents a 2 to 6 orders of magnitude improvement over existing implementations and for the first time promotes the new scheme as a practical resource for quantum secure communications.

abstract: In quantum repeater protocols, measurements are performed in multiple relay points. Classical communications are used to convey the measurement results. It is important to improve the way of conveying the measurement results so that EPR pairs are not affected by noises during classical communications. One solution is execution in the blind mode. In the blind mode, correction operations of multiple ES operations and multiple EPP operations are performed in a lump after EPR pairs are shared between the sender and the receiver. That is, the following quantum operations are performed without performing correction operations of the former quantum operations. The protocol in the conventional blind mode uses concatenated CSS codes. Therefore, the number of qubits gets large as the communication distance gets long. This paper proposes quantum repeater protocols which can be executed in the blind mode and can be constructed by using CSS codes of single encoding. This result shows that posterior processing can reduce the size of encoded states in some cases. Additionally, the results of this paper show that posterior processing can improve performance of error corrections in some cases. The proposed protocol with single encoding can correct large errors by setting some assumptions. In contrast, blind mode with single encoding can deal with small errors if propositions in this paper are not used. The key ideas in posterior processing are decomposition of errors and computations for comparing EPR pairs of different length.

We discuss the corresponding Yang-Baxterization and related symmetries in the concomitant Hamiltonian.

abstract: Projective measurement is used as a fundamental axiom in quantum mechanics, even though it is discontinuous and cannot predict which measured operator eigenstate will be observed in which experimental run. The probabilistic Born rule gives it an ensemble interpretation, predicting proportions of various outcomes over many experimental runs. Understanding gradual weak measurements requires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the collapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs. We propose such an equation, which combines attraction towards the measured operator eigenstates with stochastic white noise, and for a specific ratio of the two reproduces the Born rule. The irreducible measurement noise then becomes a fundamental property of quantum mechanics, and a necessary ingredient for any attempt to generate quantum mechanics from an underlying theory.

abstract: We investigate multiqubit permutation-symmetric states with maximal entropy of entanglement. Such states can be viewed as particular spin states, namely anticoherent spin states. Using the Majorana representation of spin states in terms of points on the unit sphere, we analyze the consequences of a point-group symmetry in their arrangement on the quantum properties of the corresponding state. We focus on the identification of anticoherent states (for which all reduced density matrices in the symmetric subspace are maximally mixed) associated with point-group symmetric sets of points. We provide three different characterizations of anticoherence, and establish a link between point symmetries, anticoherence and classes of states equivalent through stochastic local operations with classical communication (SLOCC). We then investigate in detail the case of small numbers of qubits, and construct infinite families of anticoherent states with point-group symmetry of their Majorana points, showing that anticoherent states do exist to arbitrary order.

abstract: Despite the importance of isotopically purified samples in current experiments, there have been few corresponding studies of spin qubit decoherence using full quantum bath calculations. Isotopic purification eliminates the well-studied nuclear spin baths which usually dominate decoherence. We model the coherence of electronic spin qubits in silicon near so called Clock Transitions (CT) where experiments have measured extremely long (of order seconds) electronic $T_{2e}$ times. Despite the apparent simplicity of the residual decoherence mechanism, this regime is not well understood: the state mixing which underpins Clock Transitions allows also a proliferation of contributions from usually forbidden channels (direct flip-flops with non-resonant spins); in addition, the magnitude and effects of the corresponding Overhauser fields and other detunings is not well quantified.For purely magnetic detunings, we identify a regime, potentially favourable for quantum computing, where forbidden channels are completely suppressed but spins in resonant states are fully released from Overhauser fields and applied magnetic field gradients. We show by a general argument that the enhancement between this regime and the high field limit is $< 8$, regardless of density, while enhancements of order 50 are measured experimentally. We argue that this discrepancy is likely to arise from strains of exclusively non-magnetic origin, underlining the potential of CTs for isolating and probing different types of inhomogeneities.

abstract: Quantum cryptography holds the promise to establish an information-theoretically secure global network. All field tests of metropolitan-scale quantum networks to date are based on trusted relays. The security critically relies on the accountability of the trusted relays, which will break down if the relay is dishonest or compromised. Here, we construct a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) network in a star topology over a 200 square kilometers metropolitan area, which is secure against untrustful relays and against all detection attacks. In the field test, our system continuously runs through one week with a secure key rate ten times larger than previous result. Our results demonstrate that the MDIQKD network, combining the best of both worlds --- security and practicality, constitutes an appealing solution to secure metropolitan communications.

abstract: We study the excitation spectrum of a family of transverse-field spin chain models with variable interaction range and arbitrary spin $S$, which in the case of $S=1/2$ interpolates between the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and the Ising model. For any finite number $N$ of spins, a semiclassical energy manifold is derived in the large-$S$ limit employing bosonization methods, and its geometry is shown to determine not only the leading-order term but also the higher-order quantum fluctuations. Based on a multi-configurational mean-field ansatz, we obtain the semiclassical backbone of the quantum spectrum through the extremal points of a series of one-dimensional energy landscapes -- each one exhibiting a bifurcation when the external magnetic field drops below a threshold value. The obtained spectra become exact in the limit of vanishing or very strong external, transverse magnetic fields. Further analysis of the higher-order corrections in $1/\sqrt{2S}$ enables us to study spin-wave excitations around the semiclassical energy levels which reveal the quantum phase transition in their dispersion relations. These are given analytically for arbitrary numbers of spins, allowing us to discuss the relevance of the semiclassical ($S\gg 1$) and thermodynamic ($N\rightarrow\infty$) limits for the quantum phase transition.

Quantum repeaters, as a promising approach, can overcome both photon loss and operation errors, and hence significantly speedup the communication rate. Depending on the methods used to correct loss and operation errors, all the proposed QR schemes can be classified into three categories (generations). Here we present the first systematic comparison of three generations of quantum repeaters by evaluating the cost of both temporal and physical resources, and identify the optimized quantum repeater architecture for a given set of experimental parameters. Our work provides a roadmap for the experimental realizations of highly efficient quantum networks over transcontinental distances.

abstract: Previous proposals to produce tripartite $W$-type entanglement are usually probabilistic and often based on physically unlikely events. We provide a deterministic procedure to remotely create $W$ states out of an EPR source, which is easier to produce. The proposal is made viable through measurements (which can be demolitive) in an appropriate three-qubit basis and turns out to be robust against imperfections in the bipartite source. It is possible, e. g., to create a pure ensemble of $W$ states out of an EPR source containing a systematic error. This simultaneously amounts to entanglement concentration and {\it lifting}.

title: Structure for Distinguishability of Orthogonal Bipartite States by One-Way LOCC

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Using arguments by Ye et al. [Phys. Rev. A 76, 032329 (2007)] and Nathanson [Phys. Rev. A 88, 062316 (2013)], it is shown that for any set of $n$ orthogonal bipartite states in $\mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d$, one can associate with either party of the bipartite system a subspace $\mathcal{T}_\bot$ of $d \times d$ hermitian matrices, which captures all information of one-way LOCC ($1$-LOCC) distinguishability protocols which that party can initiate. I partition all sets of orthogonal states in $\mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d$ into different classes based on the value of $dim \mathcal{T}_\bot$ corresponding to one of the parties (say Alice). It is seen that significant results about local (in)distinguishability of all sets of orthogonal states underlying a class, can be obtained by studying general ways to extract such information from said class, for e.g., Walgate et al's result [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4972 (2000)] (any two orthogonal bipartite pure states are $1$-LOCC distinguishable) and Cohen's result [Phys. Rev. A 77, 060309 (2008)] (almost all sets of $n \ge d+1$ orthogonal $N$-multipartite qudit states aren't distinguishable by LOCC) correspond to the classes $dim \mathcal{T}_\bot \ge d^2-2$ and $dim \mathcal{T}_\bot =1$ respectively. In this paper I show that a $1$-LOCC distinguishability protocol of orthogonal states corresponds to a maximal abelian subspace (MAS) in $\mathcal{T}_\bot$ and vice versa. For certain values of $dim \mathcal{T}_\bot$ this result is used to give necessary and sufficient conditions to ascertain whether or not a MAS is "hidden" in $\mathcal{T}_{\bot}$. The most significant result to emerge from this study is that it gives an algorithm which conclusively determines if there exist $1$-LOCC distinguishability protocols for the local distinguishability of almost all sets of $d$ orthogonal bipartite pure states in $\mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d$.

abstract: Quantum correlations arising in Bell experiments, involving a physical source that emits a quantum state to a number of observers, have been intensively studied over the last decades. Much less is known about the nature of quantum correlations arising in network structures beyond the Bell experiments. Such networks can involve many independent sources emitting states to observers in accordance with the network configuration. Here, we will study classical and quantum correlations in a family of networks which can be regarded as compositions of several independent multipartite Bell experiments connected together through a central node. For such networks we present tight Bell-type inequalities which are satisfied by all classical correlations. We study properties of the violations of our inequalities by probability distributions arising in quantum theory.

abstract: There is currently much interest in the two-axis countertwisting spin squeezing Hamiltonian suggested originally by Kitagawa and Ueda, since it is useful for interferometry and metrology. No analytical solution valid for arbitrary spin values seems to be available. In this article we systematically consider the issue of the analytical solvability of this Hamiltonian for various specific spin values. We show that the spin squeezing dynamics can be considered to be analytically solved for angular momentum values upto $21/2$, i.e. for $21$ spin half particles. We also identify the properties of the system responsible for yielding analytic solutions for much higher spin values than based on naive expectations. Our work is relevant for analytic characterization of squeezing experiments with low spin values, and semi-analytic modeling of higher values of spins.

abstract: We introduce a Bell inequality in a bipartite spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system with a quantum to classical violation ratio of $\frac{3}{2}$, exceeding the $\sqrt{2}$ violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. The increase is allowed by the use of products of non-commuting observables symmetrized over all possible orderings in the quantization. This shows that the non-commutativity of operations intrinsic to quantum mechanics contributes to its violation of local realism. It is shown that generalizing the inequality to high order does not increase the violation. This, along with a hidden variable model found by Toner et. al., leads us to conjecture that $\frac{3}{2}$ is the maximal possible violation.

abstract: Quantum discord as a measure of the quantum correlations cannot be easily computed for most of density operators. In this paper, we present a measure of the total quantum correlations that is operationally simple and can be computed effectively for an arbitrary mixed state of a multipartite system. The measure is based on the coherence vector of the party whose quantumness is investigated as well as the correlation matrix of this part with the remainder of the system. Being able to detect the quantumness of multipartite systems, such as detecting the quantum critical points in spin chains, alongside with the computability characteristic of the measure, make it a useful indicator to be exploited in the cases which are out of the scope of the other known measures.

abstract: We study the application of one nanoring driven by a laser field in different states of polarization in logic circuits. In particular we show that assigning boolean values to different state of the incident laser field and to the emitted signals, we can create logic gates such as OR, XOR and AND. We also show the possibility to make logic circuits such as half-adder and full-adder using one and two nanoring respectively. Using two nanorings we made the Toffoli gate. Finally we use the final angular momentum acquired by the electron to store information and hence show the possibility to use an array of nanorings as a mass memory device.

abstract: We address the question of how much entanglement can be certified from the observed correlations and the knowledge of the Hilbert space dimension of the measured systems. We focus on the case in which both systems are known to be qubits. For several correlations (though not for all), one can certify the same amount of entanglement as with state tomography, but with fewer assumptions, since nothing is assumed about the measurements. We also present security proofs of quantum key distribution without any assumption on the measurements. We discuss how both the amount of entanglement and the security of QKD are affected by the inefficiency of detectors in this scenario.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08705
abstract: The possibility that a classical space-time and quantum matter cohabit at the deepest level, i.e. the possibility of having a fundamental and not phenomenological semiclassical gravity, is often disregarded for lack of a good candidate theory. The standard semiclassical theory suffers from fundamental inconsistencies (e.g.: Schr\"odinger cat sources, faster-than-light communication and violation of the Born rule) which can only be ignored in simple typical situations. We harness the power of spontaneous localization models, historically constructed to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, to build a consistent theory of (stochastic) semiclassical gravity in the Newtonian limit. Our model makes quantitative and testable predictions: we recover the Newtonian pair potential up to a short distance cut-off and uncover an additional gravitational decoherence term which depends on the specifics of the underlying spontaneous localization model considered. We hint at a possible program to go past the Newtonian limit, towards a consistent general relativistic semiclassical gravity.

authors: Jukka Kiukas, Daniel Burgarth
comments: 4 pages, 4 figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08822
abstract: We demonstrate how quantum optimal control can be used to enhance quantum resources for bipartite one-way protocols, specifically EPR-steering with qubit measurements. Steering is relevant for one-sided device-independent key distribution, the realistic implementations of which necessitate the study of noisy scenarios. So far mainly the case of imperfect detection efficiency has been considered; here we look at the effect of dynamical noise responsible for decoherence and dissipation. In order to set up the optimisation, we map the steering problem into the equivalent joint measurability problem, and employ quantum resource-theoretic robustness monotones from that context. The advantage is that incompatibility (hence steerability) with arbitrary pairs of noisy qubit measurements has been completely characterised through an analytical expression, which can be turned into a computable cost function with exact gradient. Furthermore, dynamical loss of incompatibility has recently been illustrated using these monotones. We demonstrate resource control numerically using a special gradient-based software, showing, in particular, the advantage over naive control with cost function chosen as a fidelity in relation to a specific target. We subsequently illustrate the complexity of the control landscapes with a simplified two-variable scheme. The results contribute to the theoretical understanding of the limitations in realistic implementations of quantum information protocols, also paving way to practical use of the rather abstract quantum resource theories.

abstract: Simulations of one quantum system by an other has an implications in realization of quantum machine that can imitate any quantum systems and solve problems that are not accessible to classical computers. One of the approach to engineer quantum simulations is to discretize the space-time degree of freedom in quantum dynamics and define the quantum cellular automata (QCA), a local unitary update rule on a lattice. Different models of QCA are constructed using different set of conditions which are not uniquely defined. The form of the operators in these model are not always in implementable configuration on an other system. Here, starting from a split-step discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) which are uniquely defined for experimental implementation, we recover the Dirac quantum cellular automaton (DQCA). This will bridge the connection between Dirac equation(DE)-DQCA-DTQW and eliminate the explicit use of invariance, symmetries and limiting range of parameter to establish the connections. For a combination of parameters defining the split-step DTQW, we will show the recovery of all the fine oscillation of the probability distribution in position observed in DQCA but not in conventional DTQW. We will also present the Zitterbewegung oscillations and quantify the entanglement as a function of that parameters that define split-step DTQW. The unique definition of DTQW along with the parameter tuneability demonstrated in experimental implementation will establish it as an efficient tool to design quantum simulator with access to different physical regime and approach quantum field theory from principles of quantum information theory.

abstract: Coined Quantum Walks (QWs) are being used in many contexts with the goal of understanding quantum systems and building quantum algorithms for quantum computers. Alternative models such as Szegedy's and continuous-time QWs were proposed taking advantage from the fact that quantum theory seems to allow different quantized versions based on the same classical model, in this case, the classical random walk. In this work we show the conditions upon which coined QWs are equivalent to Szegedy's QWs. Those QW models have in common a large class of instances, in the sense that the evolution operators are equal when we convert the graph on which the coined QW takes place into a bipartite graph on which Szegedy's QW takes place and vice versa. We also show that the abstract search algorithm using the coined QW model can be cast into Szegedy's searching framework using bipartite graphs with sinks.

abstract: In this work, we study the minimal normal measurement models of quantum instruments. We show that usually the apparatus' Hilbert space in such a model is unitarily isomorphic to the minimal Stinespring dilation space of the instrument.However, if the Hilbert space of the system is infinite dimensional and the multiplicities of the outcomes of the associated observable (POVM) are all infinite then this may not be the case. In these pathological cases, the minimal apparatus' Hilbert space is shown to be unitarily isomorphic to the instrument's minimal dilation space augmented by one extra dimension. We also point out errors in earlier papers of one of the authors (J-P.P.).

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08893
abstract: "Protective measurement" refers to two related schemes for finding the expectation value of an observable without disturbing the state of a quantum system, given a single copy of the system that is subject to a "protecting" operation. There have been several claims that these schemes support interpreting the quantum state as an objective property of a single quantum system. Here we provide three counter-arguments, each of which we present in two versions tailored to the two different schemes. Our first argument shows that the same resources used in protective measurement can be used to reconstruct the quantum state in a different way via process tomography. Our second argument is based on exact analyses of special cases of protective measurement, and our final argument is to construct explicit "$\psi$-epistemic" toy models for protective measurement, which strongly suggest that protective measurement does not imply the reality of the quantum state. The common theme of the three arguments is that almost all of the information comes from the "protection" operation rather than the quantum state of the system, and hence the schemes have no implications for the reality of the quantum state.

abstract: This study presents the Fisher information for the position-dependent mass Schr\"odinger equation with hyperbolical potential {$V(x)=-V_0{\rm csch}^2(ax)$}. The analysis of the quantum-mechanical probability for the ground and exited states $(n=0, 1, 2)$ has been obtained via the Fisher's information. This controls both chemical and physical properties of some molecular systems. The Fisher information is considered only for $x>0$ due to the singular point at $x=0$. We found that Fisher-information-based uncertainty relation and the Cramer-Rao inequality holds. Some relevant numerical results are presented. The results presented shows that the Cramer-Rao and the Heisenberg products in both spaces provide a natural measure for anharmonicity of {$-V_0{\rm csch}^2(ax)$}

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.08939
abstract: We investigate the generic aspects of quantum coherence guided by the phenomenon of concentration of measure. We find the average relative entropy of coherence of a pure quantum state sampled randomly from the uniform Haar measure and show that it is typical, i.e., the probability that the relative entropy coherence of a randomly chosen pure state is not equal to the average relative entropy of coherence is exponentially small. We find the dimension of the subspace of the total Hilbert space such that all pure states that reside on it have relative entropy of coherence at least equal to the average relative entropy of coherence. Further, every state, pure or mixed in this subspace also has the coherence of formation at least equal to the average relative entropy of coherence. Moreover, we calculate the expected distance of the diagonal part of a random pure quantum state to the maximally mixed state which does not approach to zero in the asymptotic case, establishing that randomly chosen pure states are not typically maximally coherent. Additionally, we find the lower bound on the relative entropy of coherence for the set of pure states whose diagonal parts are at a fixed most probable distance from the maximally mixed state.

abstract: We propose a method to controllably suppress the effect of the four-wave mixing caused by the coupling of the strong control optical field to both optical transitions in the $\Lambda$ system under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency. At sufficiently high atomic density, this process leads to amplification of a weak optical signal field, that is detrimental for the fidelity of any EIT-based quantum information applications. Here we show that an additional absorption resonance centered around the idler field frequency, generated in such a four-wave mixing process, may efficiently suppress the unwanted signal amplification without affecting properties of the EIT interaction. We discuss the possibility of creating such tunable absorption using two-photon Raman absorption resonances in the other Rb isotope, and present some preliminary experimental results.

abstract: Bound entanglement, being entangled yet not distillable, is essential to our understandings of the relations between nonlocality and entanglement besides its applications in certain quantum information tasks. Recently, bound entangled states that violate a Bell inequality have been constructed for a two-qutrit system, disproving a conjecture by Peres that bound entanglement is local. Here we shall construct such kind of nonlocal bound entangled states for all finite dimensions larger than two, making possible their experimental demonstrations on most general systems. We propose a Bell inequality, based on a Hardy-type argument for nonlocality, and a steering inequality to identify their nonlocality. We also provide a family of entanglement witnesses to detect their entanglement beyond the Bell inequality and the steering inequality.

abstract: We present an analytical study of the Quantum Measurement Process in the context of the Stern-Gerlach experiment. We regard the spin of a silver atom as the quantum system and its position as the measuring apparatus. Both the system and the measuring apparatus are treated exactly and quantum mechanically using unitary evolution via the Schrodinger equation. We invoke the idea that the probes that determine the position of the silver atom are limited in resolution. This is usually the case, since every experiment is done with bounded resources. This results in an apparent non unitary evolution of the spin, so that a pure density matrix appears to evolve to an impure one due to the coarseness of the detection process. We use a Wigner function matrix approach to elucidate these ideas. We show that coarse measurement of position yields information about the spin state and quantify the information thus gained.

abstract: In this paper we present a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) feedback control strategy for a class of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. The feedback control law is designed based on the estimated states of a whitening quantum filter for an augmented Markovian model of the non-Markovian open quantum systems. In this augmented Markovian model, an ancillary system plays the role of internal modes of the environment converting white noise into Lorentzian noise and a principal system obeys non-Markovian dynamics due to the direct interaction with the ancillary system. The simulation results show the LQG controller with the whitening filter obtains a better control performance than that with a Markovian filter in the problem of minimizing the photon numbers of the principal system when the ancillary system is disturbed by thermal noise.

abstract: We study the squeezing of output quadratures of an electro-magnetic field escaping from a resonator coupled to a general quantum system with arbitrary interaction strengths. The generalized theoretical analysis of output squeezing proposed here is valid for all the interaction regimes of cavity-quantum electrodynamics: from the weak to the strong, ultrastrong, and deep coupling regimes. For coupling rates comparable or larger then the cavity resonance frequency, the standard input-output theory for optical cavities fails to calculate the correct output field-quadratures and predicts a non-negligible amount of output squeezing, even if the system is in its ground state. Here we show that, for arbitrary interactions and cavity-embedded quantum systems, no squeezing can be found in the output-field quadratures if the system is in its ground state. We also apply the proposed theoretical approach to study the output squeezing produced by: (i) an artificial two-level atom embedded in a coherently-excited cavity; and (ii) a cascade-type three-level system interacting with a cavity field mode. In the latter case the output squeezing arises from the virtual photons of the atom-cavity dressed states. This work extends the possibility of predicting and analyzing continuous-variable optical quantum-state tomography when optical resonators interact very strongly with other quantum systems.

abstract: Quantum coherence, existing in quantum states, is a very important resource for design and im-plementation of quantum technologies. Quantum channels that can generate coherence is also an interesting topic and less known results about it. In this paper, we focus mainly on the coherent power of quantum channels and get some interesting results of coherent power of quantum channels based on coherence measures such as the relative entropy of coherence and the 1-norm of coherence, proposed recently in [Baumgratz et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401 (2014)]. Then we characterize the coherent power of concatenation of quantum channels via that of individual channels. In addition, we also propose a new proper coherence measures. At the end of this paper, we compare two di?fferent de?nitions of the coherent powers of quantum channels and fi?nd that they are not equivalent in general.

abstract: We present the first protocol for oblivious transfer that can be implemented with an optical continuous-variable system, and prove its security in the noisy-storage model. This model allows security to be achieved by sending more quantum signals than an attacker can reliably store at one specific point during the protocol. Concretely, we determine how many signals need to be sent in order to achieve security by establishing a trade-off between quantum uncertainty generated in the protocol and the classical capacity of the memory channel. As our main technical tool, we study and derive new uncertainty relations for continuous-variable systems. Finally, we provide explicit security parameters for realistic memory models.

abstract: We give a new theoretical solution to a leading-edge experimental challenge, namely to the verification of quantum computations in the regime of high computational complexity. Our results are given in the language of quantum interactive proof systems. Specifically, we show that any language in BQP has a quantum interactive proof system with a polynomial-time classical verifier (who can also prepare random single-qubit pure states), and a quantum polynomial-time prover. Here, soundness is unconditional---i.e it holds even for computationally unbounded provers. Compared to prior work achieving similar results, our technique does not require the encoding of the input or of the computation; instead, we rely on encryption of the input (together with a method to perform computations on encrypted inputs), and show that the random choice between three types of input (defining a "computational run", versus two types of "test runs") suffice. As a proof technique, we use a reduction to an entanglement-based protocol; this enables a relatively simple analysis for a situation that has previously remained ambiguous in the literature.

It allows one to reach the quantum nonlinear regime of optomechanics, where nonlinear effects are observed at the single photon level, even if the bare coupling strength is much smaller than the mechanical frequency and cavity damping rate. Our method is based on using a large amplitude, strongly detuned mechanical parametric drive to amplify mechanical zero-point fluctuations and hence enhance the radiation pressure interaction. It has the further benefit of allowing time-dependent control, enabling pulsed schemes. For a two-cavity optomechanical setup, we show that our scheme generates photon blockade for experimentally accessible parameters, and even makes the production of photonic states with negative Wigner functions possible. We discuss how our method is an example of a more general strategy for enhancing boson-mediated two-particle interactions and nonlinearities.

abstract: We consider the number of quantum queries required to determine the coefficients of a degree-d polynomial over GF(q). A lower bound shown independently by Kane and Kutin and by Meyer and Pommersheim shows that d/2+1/2 quantum queries are needed to solve this problem with bounded error, whereas an algorithm of Boneh and Zhandry shows that d quantum queries are sufficient. We show that the lower bound is achievable: d/2+1/2 quantum queries suffice to determine the polynomial with bounded error. Furthermore, we show that d/2+1 queries suffice to achieve probability approaching 1 for large q. These upper bounds improve results of Boneh and Zhandry on the insecurity of cryptographic protocols against quantum attacks. We also show that our algorithm's success probability as a function of the number of queries is precisely optimal. Furthermore, the algorithm can be implemented with gate complexity poly(log q) with negligible decrease in the success probability.

abstract: We show that the frequency distribution of the first significant digits of the numbers in the data sets generated from a large class of measures of quantum correlations, which are either entanglement measures, or belong to the information-theoretic paradigm, exhibit a universal behavior. In particular, for Haar uniformly simulated arbitrary two-qubit states, we find that the first-digit distribution corresponding to a collection of chosen computable quantum correlation quantifiers tend to follow the first-digit law, known as the Benford's law, when rank of the states increases. Considering a two-qubit state which is obtained from a system governed by a specific Hamiltonian -- the anisotropic XY model with a transverse magnetic field -- we see that entanglement as well as information theoretic measures violate the Benford's law. However, interestingly, we find that among all the quantum correlation measures, quantum discord is the only measure which, like the transverse magnetization of the system, changes the pattern of the first-digit distribution depending on the quantum phases present in this model. We also comment on the universality of the statistics of first significant digits corresponding to appropriate measures of quantum correlations in the case of multipartite systems as well as systems in higher dimensions.

abstract: In this article we propose a dynamic quantum tomography model for open quantum systems with evolution given by phase-damping channels. Mathematically, these channels correspond to completely positive trace-preserving maps defined by the Hadamard product of the initial density matrix with a time-dependent matrix which carries the knowledge about the evolution. Physically, there is a strong motivation for considering this kind of evolution because such channels appear naturally in the theory of open quantum systems. The main idea behind a dynamic approach to quantum tomography claims that by performing the same kind of measurement at some time instants one can obtain new data for state reconstruction. Thus, this approach leads to a decrease in the number of distinct observables which are required for quantum tomography; however, the exact benefit for employing the dynamic approach depends strictly on how the quantum system evolves in time. Algebraic analysis of phase-damping channels allows one to determine optimal criteria for quantum tomography of systems in question. General theorems and observations presented in the paper are accompanied by a specific example, which shows step by step how the theory works. The results introduced in this article can potentially be applied in experiments where there is a tendency a look at quantum tomography from the point of view of economy of measurements, because each distinct kind of measurement requires, in general, preparing a separate setup.

abstract: We study the interplay among large-spin, spin orbit coupling, and superfluidity for bosons in a two dimensional optical lattice, focusing on the spin-1 spin-orbit coupled system recently realized at the Joint Quantum Institute [Campbell et. al., arXiv:1501.05984]. We find a rich quantum phase diagram, where, in addition to the conventional phases -superfluid and insulator- contained in the spin-$1$ Bose-Hubbard model, there are new symmetry broken spin-orbit driven exotic phases where bosons condense at single or multiple points in momentum space, that have no analog in the continuum. In the lattice, increasing the spin-orbit coupling strength induces a robust spin density wave superfluid with broken translation symmetry where a non-zero condensate fraction occurs both at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone. For strong interactions, spin density wave order is suppressed concomitantly with the condensate at zero momentum leading to a continuous transition into a superfluid only at the Brillouin zone edge. We show that the spin density wave superfluid phase survives in a two dimensional harmonic trap, and thus establish that our results are directly applicable to experiments on $^{87}$Rb, $^7$Li, and $^{41}$K.

abstract: Every solution of the Bethe-ansatz equations (BAE) is characterized by a set of quantum numbers, by which we can evaluate it numerically. However, no general rule is known how to give quantum numbers for the physical solutions of BAE. For the spin-1/2 XXX chain we rigorously derive all the quantum numbers for the complete set of the Bethe-ansatz eigenvectors in the two down-spin sector with any chain length $N$. Here we obtain them both for real and complex solutions. Consequently, we prove the completeness of the Bethe ansatz and give an exact expression for the number of real solutions which correspond to collapsed bound-state solutions (i.e., 2-string solutions) in the sector: $2[ (N-1)/2 - (N/\pi) \tan^{-1}(\sqrt{N-1})]$ in terms of Gauss' symbol. Moreover, we prove in the sector the scheme conjectured by Takahashi for solving BAE systematically. We also suggest that by applying the present method we can derive the quantum numbers for the spin-1/2 XXZ chain.

abstract: We demonstrate that for general conformal field theories (CFTs), the entanglement for small perturbations of the vacuum is organized in a novel holographic way. For spherical entangling regions in a constant time slice, perturbations in the entanglement entropy are solutions of a Klein-Gordon equation in an auxiliary de Sitter (dS) spacetime. The role of the emergent time-like direction in dS is played by the size of the entangling sphere. For CFTs with extra conserved charges, e.g., higher spin charges, we show that each charge gives rise to a separate dynamical scalar field in dS.

abstract: We suggest and demonstrate a protocol which suppresses dephasing due to the low-frequency noise by qubit motion, i.e., transfer of the logical qubit of information in a system of $n \geq 2$ physical qubits. The protocol requires only the nearest-neighbor coupling and is applicable to different qubit structures. We further analyze its effectiveness against noises with arbitrary correlations. Our analysis, together with experiments using up to three superconducting qubits, shows that for the realistic uncorrelated noises, qubit motion increases the dephasing time of the logical qubit as $\sqrt{n}$. In general, the protocol provides a diagnostic tool to measure the noise correlations.

abstract: Since Dicke's seminal paper on coherence in spontaneous radiation by atomic ensembles, superradiance has been extensively studied. Subradiance, on the contrary, has remained elusive, mainly because subradiant states are weakly coupled to the environment and are very sensitive to nonradiative decoherence processes.Here we report the direct observation of subradiance in an extended and dilute cold-atom sample containing a large number of particles. We use a far detuned laser to avoid multiple scattering and observe the temporal decay after a sudden switch-off of the laser beam. After the fast decay of most of the fluorescence, we detect a very slow decay, with time constants as long as 100 times the natural lifetime of the excited state of individual atoms. This subradiant time constant scales linearly with the cooperativity parameter, corresponding to the on-resonance optical thickness of the sample, and is independent of the laser detuning, as expected from a coupled-dipole model.

abstract: The formalism of matrix product states is used to perform a numerical study of 1+1 dimensional QED -- also known as the (massive) Schwinger model -- in the presence of an external static `quark' and `antiquark'. We obtain the large distance behavior of the interquark potential for different probe charges and this for a wide range of couplings, recovering the predicted behavior both in the weak and strong coupling limit of the continuum theory. Furthermore we give a detailed picture of the transition from the confining state at short interquark distances to the broken-string `hadronized' state at large distances. Finally, we also study this transition for fractional probe charges, simulating for the first time the phenomenon of partial string breaking.

abstract: High precision spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen has recently led to an anomaly in the Lamb shift, which has been parametrized in terms of a proton charge radius differing by seven standard deviations from the CODATA value. We show how this anomaly may be explained, within about a factor of three, in the framework of an effective Yukawian gravitational potential related to charged weak interactions, without additional free parameters with respect to the ones of the standard model. The residual discrepancy from the experimental result in this model should be attributable to the approximations introduced in the calculation, the uncertainty in the exact value of the Fermi scale relevant to the model and the lack of detailed knowledge on the gravitational radius of the proton. The latter cannot be inferred with electromagnetic probes due to the unknown gluonic contribution to the proton mass distribution. In this context, we argue that muonic hydrogen acts like a microscopic gravimeter suitable for testing a possible scenario for the reciprocal morphing between macroscopic gravitation and weak interactions, with the latter seen as the quantum, microscopic counterpart of the former.

abstract: Quantum multipole noise is defined as a family of creation and annihilation operators with commutation relations proportional to derivatives of delta function of difference of the times, $[c^-_n(t),c^+_n(\tau)]\approx \delta^{(n)}(\tau-t)$. In this paper an explicit operator representation of the quantum multipole noise is constructed in a suitable pseudo-Hilbert space (i.e., in a Hilbert space with indefinite metric). For making this representation, we introduce a class of Hilbert spaces obtained as completion of the Schwartz space in specific norms. Using this representation, we obtain an asymptotic expansion as a series in quantum multipole noise for multitime correlation functions which describe the dynamics of open quantum systems weakly interacting with a reservoir.

It has identified universal properties of complex networks, and the interplay between their structure and dynamics. After almost twenty years of the field, new challenges lie ahead. These challenges concern the multilayer structure of most of the networks, the formulation of a network geometry and topology, and the development of a quantum theory of networks. Making progress on these aspects of network theory can open new venues to address interdisciplinary and physics challenges including progress on brain dynamics, new insights into quantum technologies, and quantum gravity.

It is shown that a suitable choice of boundary conditions has to be made in order to preserve unitarity. For these boundary conditions we compute explicitly the geometric phase two-form on the parameter space. The unboundedness of the Hamiltonian describing the system leads to a natural prescription of renormalization for divergent contributions arising from the boundary.

abstract: We establish bounds on the decay of time-dependent multipoint correlation functionals of one-dimensional quasi-free fermions in terms of the decay properties of their two-point function. At a technical level, this is done with the help of bounds on certain bordered determinants and pfaffians. These bounds, which we prove, go beyond the well-known Hadamard estimates. Our main application of these results is a proof of strong (exponential) dynamical localization of spin-correlation functions in disordered $XY$-spin chains.

The present calculations are based on using two types of compact and accurate trial wave functions, which are put forward for consideration in calculating energies in the absence of magnetic field. The obtained results are compared with the most recent accurate values. We conclude that the applications of VMC method can be extended successfully to cover the case of molecules under the effect of the magnetic field.

Using a gas of ultracold fermions in an optical lattice, we artifically prepare an initial charge density wave in an array of 1D tubes with quasi-random onsite disorder and monitor the subsequent dynamics over several thousand tunneling times. We find a strikingly different behavior between MBL and Anderson Localization. While the non-interacting Anderson case remains localized, in the interacting case any coupling between the tubes leads to a delocalization of the entire system.

We show that, with minimal modifications, the standard constructions of Schrodinger quantum mechanics for constrained systems work for pseudoclassical systems as well. In particular, we construct the space of spinors as physical wave functions of anticommuting variables.

abstract: In Pedersen et al. (2011) we proposed a method to utilize a temporally dependent superlattice potential to mediate spin-selective transport, and thereby probe long and short range magnetic correlations in optical lattices. Specifically this can be used for detecting antiferromagnetic ordering in repulsive fermionic optical lattice systems, but more generally it can serve as a means of directly probing correlations among the atoms by measuring the mean value of an observable, the number of double occupied sites. Here, we provide a detailed investigation of the physical processes which limit the effectiveness of this "conveyer belt method". Furthermore we propose a simple ways to improve the procedure, resulting in an essentially perfect (error-free) probing of the magnetic correlations. These results shows that suitably constructed superlattices constitute a promising way of manipulating atoms of different spin species as well as probing their interactions.

abstract: Dynamical localization, i.e. the absence of secular spreading of a quantum or classical wave packet, is usually associated to Hamiltonians with purely point spectrum, i.e. with a normalizable and complete set of eigenstates, which show quasi-periodic dynamics (recurrence). Here we show rather counter-intuitively that dynamical localization can be observed in Hamiltonians with absolutely continuous spectrum, where recurrence effects are forbidden. An optical realization of such an Hamiltonian is proposed based on beam propagation in a self-imaging optical resonator with a phase grating. Localization without recurrence in this system is explained in terms of pseudo-Bloch optical oscillations.

abstract: Chaotic eigenstates of quantum systems are known to localize on either side of a classical partial transport barrier if the flux connecting the two sides is quantum mechanically not resolved due to Heisenberg's uncertainty. Surprisingly, in open systems with escape chaotic resonance states can localize even if the flux is quantum mechanically resolved. We explain this using the concept of conditionally invariant measures from classical dynamical systems by introducing a new quantum mechanically relevant class of such fractal measures. We numerically find quantum-to-classical correspondence for localization transitions depending on the openness of the system and on the decay rate of resonance states.

abstract: We investigate the effect of a unidirectional quenched random field on the anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 $XY$ model, which magnetizes spontaneously in the absence of the random field. We adopt mean-field approach to show that spontaneous magnetization persists even in the presence of this random field but the magnitude of magnetization gets suppressed due to disorder, and the system magnetizes in the directions parallel and transverse to the random field. Our results are obtained by analytical calculations within perturbative framework and by numerical simulations. Interestingly, we show that it is possible to enhance a component of the magnetization in presence of the disorder field provided we apply an additional constant field in the $XY$ plane. Moreover, we derive generalized expressions for the critical temperature and the scalings of the magnetization near the critical point for the $XY$ spin system with arbitrary fixed quantum spin angular momentum.

abstract: The sphere packing bound, in the form given by Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp, was recently extended to classical-quantum channels, and it was shown that this creates a natural setting for combining probabilistic approaches with some combinatorial ones such as the Lov\'asz theta function. In this paper, we extend the study to the case of constant composition codes. We first extend the sphere packing bound for classical-quantum channels to this case, and we then show that the obtained result is related to a variation of the Lov\'asz theta function studied by Marton. We then propose a further extension to the case of varying channels and codewords with a constant conditional composition given a particular sequence. This extension is then applied to auxiliary channels to deduce a bound which can be interpreted as an extension of the Elias bound.

abstract: In the present work we show, analytically and numerically, that the variance of many-particle operators and their uncertainty product for an out-of-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can deviate from the outcome of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics, even in the limit of infinite number of particles and at constant interaction parameter when the system becomes 100% condensed. We demonstrate our finding on the dynamics of the center-of-mass position--momentum uncertainty product of a freely expanding as well as of a trapped BEC. This time-dependent many-body phenomenon is explained by the existence of time-dependent correlations which manifest themselves in the system's reduced two-body density matrix used to evaluate the uncertainty product. Our work demonstrates that one has to use a many-body propagation theory to describe an out-of-equilibrium BEC, even in the infinite particle limit.

abstract: In the theory of Bethe-ansatz integrable quantum systems, rapidities play an important role as they are used to specify many-body states, apart from phases. The physical interpretation of rapidities going back to Sutherland is that they are the asymptotic momenta after letting a quantum gas expand into a larger volume making it dilute and noninteracting. We exploit this picture to make a direct connection to quantities that are accessible in sudden-expansion experiments with ultracold quantum gases. By a direct comparison of Bethe-ansatz and time-dependent density matrix renormalization group results, we demonstrate that the expansion velocity of a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model can be predicted from knowing the distribution of occupied rapidities defined by the initial state. Curiously, an approximate Bethe-ansatz solution works well also for the Bose-Hubbard model.

abstract: We report on the observation of anti-ferromagnetic correlations of ultracold fermions in a variety of optical lattice geometries that are well described by the Hubbard model, including dimers, 1D chains, ladders, isolated and coupled honeycomb planes, as well as square and cubic lattices. The dependence of the strength of spin correlations on the specific geometry is experimentally studied by measuring the correlations along different lattice tunneling links, where a redistribution of correlations between the different lattice links is observed. By measuring the correlations in a crossover between distinct geometries, we demonstrate an effective reduction of the dimensionality for our atom numbers and temperatures. We also investigate the formation and redistribution time of spin correlations by dynamically changing the lattice geometry and studying the time-evolution of the system. Timescales ranging from a sudden quench of the lattice geometry to an adiabatic evolution are probed.

abstract: The evolution of electron wavepackets determines the course of many physical and chemical phenomena and attosecond spectroscopy aims to measure and control such dynamics in real-time. Here, we investigate radial electron wavepacket motion in Helium by using an XUV attosecond pulse train to prepare a coherent superposition of excited states and a delayed femtosecond IR pulse to ionize them. Quantum beat signals observed in the high resolution photoelectron spectrogram allow us to follow the field-free evolution of the bound electron wavepacket and determine the time-dependent ionization dynamics of the low-lying 2p state.

abstract: Anyons exist as point like particles in two dimensions and carry braid statistics which enable interactions that are independent of the distance between the particles. Except for a relatively few number of models which are analytically tractable, much of the physics of anyons remain still unexplored. In this paper, we show how U(1)-symmetry can be combined with the previously proposed anyonic Matrix Product States to simulate ground states and dynamics of anyonic systems on a lattice at any rational particle number density. We provide proof of principle by studying itinerant anyons on a one dimensional chain where no natural notion of braiding arises and also on a two-leg ladder where the anyons hop between sites and possibly braid. We compare the result of the ground state energies of Fibonacci anyons against hardcore bosons and spinless fermions. In addition, we report the entanglement entropies of the ground states of interacting Fibonacci anyons on a fully filled two-leg ladder at different interaction strength, identifying gapped or gapless points in the parameter space. As an outlook, our approach can also prove useful in studying the time dynamics of a finite number of nonabelian anyons on a finite two-dimensional lattice.

abstract: We present a multimode Hamiltonian formulation for the problem of opto-acoustic interactions in optical waveguides. We establish a Hamiltonian representation of the acoustic field and then introduce a full system with a simple opto-acoustic coupling that includes both photoelastic/electrostrictive and radiation pressure/moving boundary effects. The Heisenberg equations of motion are used to obtain coupled mode equations for quantized envelope operators for the optical and acoustic fields. We show that the coupling coefficients obtained coincide with those established earlier, but our formalism provides a much simpler demonstration of the connection between radiation pressure and moving boundary effects than in previous work [C. Wolff et al, Physical Review A 92, 013836 (2015)].

We then evaluate the volume of classical, quantum and quantum entangled states for two-mode systems showing chains of strict inclusion.

abstract: Superconducting enclosures will be key components of scalable quantum computing devices based on circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Within a densely integrated device, they can protect qubits from noise and serve as quantum memory units. Whether constructed by machining bulk pieces of metal or microfabricating wafers, 3D enclosures are typically assembled from two or more parts. The resulting seams potentially dissipate crossing currents and limit performance. In this Letter, we present measured quality factors of superconducting cavity resonators of several materials, dimensions and seam locations. We observe that superconducting indium can be a low-loss RF conductor and form low-loss seams. Leveraging this, we create a superconducting micromachined resonator with indium that has a quality factor of two million despite a greatly reduced mode volume. Inter-layer coupling to this type of resonator is achieved by an aperture located under a planar transmission line. The described techniques demonstrate a proof-of-principle for multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuits for scalable quantum computing.

abstract: Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is rapidly gaining prominence in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. Despite this generality, measuring entanglement remains challenging. This is especially true in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive. Here, we measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant particles using quantum interference of many-body twins. Leveraging our single-site resolved control of ultra-cold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we prepare and interfere two identical copies of a many-body state. This enables us to directly measure quantum purity, Renyi entanglement entropy, and mutual information. These experiments pave the way for using entanglement to characterize quantum phases and dynamics of strongly-correlated many-body systems.

abstract: Entangled photons have the remarkable ability to be more sensitive to signal and less sensitive to noise than classical light. Joint photons can sample an object collectively, resulting in faster phase accumulation and higher spatial resolution, while common components of noise can be subtracted. Even more, they can accomplish this while physically separate, due to the nonlocal properties of quantum mechanics. Indeed, nearly all quantum optics experiments rely on this separation, using individual point detectors that are scanned to measure coincidence counts and correlations. Scanning, however, is tedious, time consuming, and ill-suited for imaging. Moreover, the separation of beam paths adds complexity to the system while reducing the number of photons available for sampling, and the multiplicity of detectors does not scale well for greater numbers of photons and higher orders of entanglement. We bypass all of these problems here by directly imaging collinear photon pairs with an electron-multiplying CCD camera. We show explicitly the benefits of quantum nonlocality by engineering the spatial entanglement of the illuminating photons and introduce a new method of correlation measurement by converting time-domain coincidence counting into spatial-domain detection of selected pixels. We show that classical transport-of-intensity methods are applicable in the quantum domain and experimentally demonstrate nearly optimal (Heisenberg-limited) phase measurement for the given quantum illumination. The methods show the power of direct imaging and hold much potential for more general types of quantum information processing and control.

abstract: Many-body eigenfunctions of the total spin operator can be constructed from the spin and spatial wavefunctions with non-trivial permutation symmetries. Spin-dependent interactions can lead to relaxation of the spin eigenstates to the thermal equilibrium. The relaxation rate is evaluated here for two- and three-dimensional gases using the chaotic behavior of the thermally-equilibrium spatial state. Dependence of the rate on the total spin and its projection is separated into a factor, which is independent of the gas dimensionality, temperature, and density. This factor can be controlled by a Feshbach resonance, leading to suppression of the relaxation rate by several orders of magnitude.

abstract: Fidelity decay and entropy production, with time, of a many particle system of fermions (or bosons) in a mean-field and quenched by a random two-body interaction is generated by a Hamiltonian that is represented by embedded Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices (for time-reversal and rotationally invariant systems) with one plus two-body interactions [EGOE(1+2)]. Numerical studies are carried out for a system of 8 fermions in 16 single particle states with the fermions carrying spin degree of freedom and also for a system with 10 bosons in 5 single particle states, by varying the strength of the interaction. Results for the fidelity decay compare well not only with the EGOE formula in the Gaussian domain but also with a new formula for the BW to Gaussian transition region. Applying the approximation suggested by Flambaum and Izrailev, formula for entropy production for EGOE(1+2) in the Gaussian region with extension into BW region is derived along with an analytical expression for the time $t_{sat}$ for onset of saturation of entropy. These EGOE results are in good agreement with numerical calculations. Finally, Fermion system shows significant spin dependence of the relaxation dynamics of the entropy.

abstract: The elliptic Gaudin model describes completely anisotropic spin systems with long range interactions. The model was proven to be quantum integrable by Gaudin and latter the exact solution was found by means of the algebraic Bethe ansatz. In spite of the appealing properties of the model, it has not yet been applied to any physical problem. We here generalize the exact solution to systems with arbitrary spins, and study numerically the behavior of the Bethe roots for a system with three different spins. Then, we propose an integrable anisotropic central spin model that we study numerically for very large systems.

abstract: Light-harvesting complexes of purple bacteria have two properties that are thought to contribute to the efficiency of their exciton transport: an energy funnel that directs excitons towards the reaction centre as well as substantial excitonic delocalisation, which can enhance transport through supertransfer. To determine the relative importance of these two features, we compared models of the light-harvesting apparatus with thousands of counterfactual situations in which the extent of delocalisation and the energy landscape were altered. We find that the influence of delocalisation is usually minor and sometimes deleterious, especially when compared to the decisive importance of a funnel in the energy landscape. Consequently, delocalisation is most likely a side-effect of the dense chlorophyll packing that evolved to increase light absorption per reaction centre.

abstract: We demonstrate a new approach for engineering group IV semiconductor-based quantum photonic structures containing negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^-$) color centers in diamond as quantum emitters. Hybrid SiC/diamond structures are realized by combining the growth of nanoand micro-diamonds on silicon carbide (3C or 4H polytype) substrates, with the subsequent use of these diamond crystals as a hard mask for pattern transfer. SiV$^-$ color centers are incorporated in diamond during its synthesis from molecular diamond seeds (diamondoids), with no need for ionimplantation or annealing. We show that the same growth technique can be used to grow a diamond layer controllably doped with SiV$^-$ on top of a high purity bulk diamond, in which we subsequently fabricate nanopillar arrays containing high quality SiV$^-$ centers. Scanning confocal photoluminescence measurements reveal optically active SiV$^-$ lines both at room temperature and low temperature (5 K) from all fabricated structures, and, in particular, very narrow linewidths and small inhomogeneous broadening of SiV$^-$ lines from all-diamond nano-pillar arrays, which is a critical requirement for quantum computation. At low temperatures (5 K) we observe in these structures the signature typical of SiV$^-$ centers in bulk diamond, consistent with a double lambda. These results indicate that high quality color centers can be incorporated into nanophotonic structures synthetically with properties equivalent to those in bulk diamond, thereby opening opportunities for applications in classical and quantum information processing.

abstract: Experimental quantum information processing with superconducting circuits is rapidly advancing, driven by innovation in two classes of devices, one involving planar micro-fabricated (2D) resonators, and the other involving machined three-dimensional (3D) cavities. We demonstrate that circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), which is based on the interaction of low-loss resonators and qubits, can be implemented in a multilayer superconducting structure, which combines 2D and 3D advantages, hence its nickname "2.5." We employ standard micro-fabrication techniques to pattern each layer, and rely on a vacuum gap between the layers to store the electromagnetic energy. Planar superconducting qubits are lithographically defined as an aperture in a conducting boundary of multilayer resonators, rather than as a separate metallic structure on an insulating substrate. In order to demonstrate the potential of these design principles, we implemented an integrated, two-cavity-modes, one-transmon-qubit system for cQED experiments. The measured coherence times and coupling energies suggest that the 2.5D platform would be a promising base for integrated quantum information processing.

abstract: The canonical Aharonov-Bohm effect is usually studied with time-independent potentials. In this work, we investigate the Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired by a charged particle moving in {\it time-dependent} potentials . In particular, we focus on the case of a charged particle moving in the time varying field of a plane electromagnetic wave. We work out the Aharonov-Bohm phase using both the potential ({\it i.e.} $\oint A_\mu dx ^\mu$) and field ({\it i.e.} $\frac{1}{2}\int F_{\mu \nu} d \sigma ^{\mu \nu}$) forms of the Aharanov-Bohm phase. We give conditions in terms of the parameters of the system (frequency of the electromagnetic wave, the size of the space-time loop, amplitude of the electromagnetic wave) under which the time varying Aharonov-Bohm effect could be observed.

abstract: We present measurements of silica optomechanical resonators, known as bottle resonators, passively cooled in a cryogenic environment. These devices possess a suite of properties that make them advantageous for preparation and measurement in the mechanical ground state, including high mechanical frequency, high optical and mechanical quality factors, and optomechanical sideband resolution. Performing thermometry of the mechanical motion, we find that the optical and mechanical modes demonstrate quantitatively similar laser-induced heating, limiting the lowest average phonon occupation observed to just ~1500. Thermalization to the 9 mK thermal bath would facilitate quantum measurements on these promising nanogram-scale mechanical resonators.

abstract: Recently, fractional Chern insulators (FCIs), also called fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, have been theoretically established in lattice systems with topological flat bands. These systems exhibit similar fractionalization phenomena as the conventional fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems. Using the mapping relationship between the FQH states and the FCI/FQAH states, we construct the many-body wave functions of the fermionic FCI/FQAH states on the disk geometry with the aid of the generalized Pauli principle (GPP) and the Jack polynomials. Compared with the ground state by exact diagonalization method, the wave-function overlap is higher than $0.97$ even when the Hilbert space dimension is as large as $3\times10^6$. We also use the GPP and the Jack polynomials to construct edge excitations for the ferminoic FCI/FQAH states. The quasi-degeneracy sequences of fermionic FCI/FQAH systems reproduce the prediction of the chiral Luttinger liquid theory, complementing the exact diagonalization results with larger lattice sizes and more particles.

Our results are relevant for the construction of disordered complex semiconductor micro-lasers and active Mie sphere samples. They define concrete critical parameters for the phase transition to lasing in disordered non-linear random media.

abstract: We introduce a new optical tool - a "two-dimensional optical centrifuge", capable of aligning molecules in extreme rotational states. Unlike the conventional centrifuge, which confines the molecules in the plane of their rotation, its two-dimensional version aligns the molecules along a well-defined axis, similarly to the effect of a single linearly polarized laser pulse, but at a much higher level of rotational excitation. The increased robustness of ultra-high rotational states with respect to collisions results in a longer life time of the created alignment in dense media, offering new possibilities for studying and utilizing aligned molecular ensembles under ambient conditions.

Examples are given for the superposition of an XFEL beam with an optical high-intensity laser beam. Such a configuration is available, e.g., at LCLS at present and at European XFEL in near future. It requires a counter propagating probe photon beam with high energy which can be generated by synchronized inverse Compton backscattering.

abstract: We study lattice wave functions obtained from the SU(2)$_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. Following Moore and Read's construction, the Kalmeyer-Laughlin fractional quantum Hall state is defined as a correlation function of primary fields. By an additional insertion of Kac-Moody currents, we associate a wave function to each state of the conformal field theory. These wave functions span the complete Hilbert space of the lattice system. On the cylinder, we study global properties of the lattice states analytically and correlation functions numerically using a quantum Monte Carlo method. By comparing short-range bulk correlations, numerical evidence is provided that the states with one current operator represent edge states in the thermodynamical limit. We show that the edge states with one Kac-Moody current of lowest order have a good overlap with low-energy excited states of a local Hamiltonian, for which the Kalmeyer-Laughlin state approximates the ground state. For some states, exact parent Hamiltonians are derived on the cylinder. These Hamiltonians are SU(2) invariant and nonlocal with up to four-body interactions.

abstract: We investigate the superfluid behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^6$Li molecules. In the experiment by Weimer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 095301 (2015) a condensate is stirred by a weak, red-detuned laser beam along a circular path around the trap center. The rate of induced heating increases steeply above a velocity $v_c$, which we define as the critical velocity. Below this velocity, the moving beam creates almost no heating. In this paper, we demonstrate a quantitative understanding of the critical velocity. Using both numerical and analytical methods, we identify the non-zero temperature, the circular motion of the stirrer, and the density profile of the cloud as key factors influencing the magnitude of $v_c$. A direct comparison to the experimental data shows excellent agreement.

abstract: We report on the experimental observation of scaling in the time evolution following a sudden quench into the vicinity of a quantum critical point. The experimental system, a two-component Bose gas with coherent exchange between the constituents, allows for the necessary high level of control of parameters as well as the access to time-resolved spatial correlation functions. The theoretical analysis reveals that quenching the system close to the critical point, the energy introduced by the quench leads to a short-time evolution exhibiting crossover reminiscent of the finite-temperature critical properties in the system's universality class. Observing the time evolution after a quench represents a paradigm shift in accessing and probing experimentally universal properties close to a quantum critical point and allows in a new way benchmarking of quantum many-body theory with experiments.

abstract: Topology and geometry are essential to our understanding of modern physics, underlying many foundational concepts from high energy theories, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. In condensed matter systems, a wide range of phenomena stem from the geometry of the band eigenstates, which is encoded in the matrix-valued Wilson line for general multi-band systems. By realizing strong-force dynamics in Bloch bands that are described by Wilson lines, we observe an evolution of band populations that is purely geometric in origin and directly reveals both the band geometry and dispersion relation. Our work constitutes the first reconstruction of Wilson lines in a band structure and enables a full determination of band eigenstates, Berry curvature, and topological invariants, including single- and multi-band Chern and $Z_2$ numbers.

abstract: Resonant exchange qubits are a promising addition to the family of experimentally implemented encodings of single qubits using semiconductor quantum dots. We have shown previously that it ought to be straightforward to perform a CPHASE gate between two resonant exchange qubits with a single exchange pulse. This approach uses energy gaps to suppress leakage rather than conventional pulse sequences. In this paper we present analysis and simulations of our proposed two-qubit gate subject to charge and Overhauser field noise at levels observed in current experiments. Our main result is that we expect implementations of our two-qubit gate to achieve high fidelities, with errors at the percent level and gate times comparable to single-qubit operations. As such, exchange-coupled resonant exchange qubits remain an attractive approach for quantum computing.

abstract: The spectral properties of interacting strongly chaotic systems are investigated for growing interaction strength. A very sensitive transition from Poisson statistics to that of random matrix theory is found. We introduce a new random matrix ensemble modeling this dynamical symmetry breaking transition which turns out to be universal and depends on a single scaling parameter only. Coupled kicked rotors, a dynamical systems paradigm for such transitions, are compared with this ensemble and excellent agreement is found for the nearest-neighbor-spacing distribution. It turns out that this transition is described quite accurately using perturbation theory.

abstract: We develop the notions of hypercontractivity (HC) and the log-Sobolev (LS) inequality for completely bounded norms of one-parameter semigroups of super-operators acting on matrix algebras. We prove the equivalence of the completely bounded versions of HC and LS under suitable hypotheses. We also prove a version of the Gross Lemma which allows LS at general $q$ to be deduced from LS at $q=2$.

abstract: We report the experimental investigation and theoretical modeling of a rotating polariton superfluid relying on an innovative method for the injection of angular momentum.This novel, multi-pump injection method uses four coherent lasers arranged in a square, resonantly creating four polariton populations propagating inwards. The control available over the direction of propagation of the superflows allows injecting a controllable amount of optical angular momentum. When the density at the center is low enough to neglect polariton-polariton interactions, optical singularities, associated to an interference pattern, are visible in the phase. Remarkably, in the superfluid regime resulting from the strong nonlinear polariton-polariton interaction the interference pattern disappears and only vortices with the same sign are persisting in the system. By comparing these results with simulations based on a driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii model, we ascribe these remaining topological defects to the conservation of angular momentum.

abstract: Efficiently discriminating beams carrying different orbital angular momentum (OAM) is of fundamental importance for various applications including high capacity optical communication and quantum information processing. We design and experimentally verify a distinguished method for effectively splitting different OAM-carried beams by introducing Dove prisms in a ring cavity. Because of rotational symmetry broken of two OAM-carried beams with opposite topological charges, their transmission spectra will split. When mode and impedance matches between the cavity and one OAM-carried beam are achieved, this beam will transmit through the cavity, and other beam will be reflected without being destroyed their spatial shapes. In this case, the cavity acts like a polarized beam splitter. The transmitting beam can be selected at your will. The splitting efficiency can reach unity if the cavity is lossless and it completely matches with the beam. Beams carry multi-OAMs can also be effectively split by cascading ring cavities.

abstract: The description of the universe evolving in time according to general relativity is given in comparison with the quantum description of the same universe in terms of semiclassical wave functions. The spacetime geometry is determined by the Robertson-Walker metric. It is shown that the main equation of the quantum geometrodynamics is reduced to the non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Its non-linearity is caused by a new source of the gravitational field, which has a purely quantum dynamical nature, and is additional to ordinary matter sources. In the semiclassical approximation, the non-linear equation of motion is linearized and reduces to the Friedmann equation with the additional quantum source of gravity (or anti-gravity) in the form of the stiff Zel'dovich matter. The semiclassical wave functions of the universe, in which different types of matter-energies dominate, are obtained. As examples, the cases of the domination of radiation, barotropic fluid, or new quantum matter-energy are discussed. The probability of the transition from the quantum state, where radiation dominates into the state, in which barotropic fluid in the form of dust is dominant, is calculated. This probability has the same order of magnitude as the matter density contrast in the era of matter-radiation equality.

abstract: Excitonic couplings between (bacterio)chlorophyll molecules are necessary for simulating energy transport in photosynthetic complexes. Many techniques for calculating the couplings are in use, from the simple (but inaccurate) point-dipole approximation to fully quantum-chemical methods. We compared several approximations to determine their range of applicability, noting that the propagation of experimental uncertainties poses a fundamental limit on the achievable accuracy. In particular, the uncertainty in crystallographic coordinates yields an uncertainty of about 20% in the calculated couplings. Because quantum-chemical corrections are smaller than 20% in most biologically relevant cases, their considerable computational cost is rarely justified. We therefore recommend the electrostatic TrEsp method across the entire range of molecular separations and orientations because its cost is minimal and it generally agrees with quantum-chemical calculations to better than the geometric uncertainty. We also caution against computationally optimizing a crystal structure before calculating couplings, as it can lead to large, uncontrollable errors. Understanding the unavoidable uncertainties can guard against striving for unrealistic precision; at the same time, detailed benchmarks can allow important qualitative questions--which do not depend on the precise values of the simulation parameters--to be addressed with greater confidence about the conclusions.

abstract: Vacuum polarization of charged massless fermions is investigated in the superposition of Coulomb and Aharonov--Bohm (AB) potentials in 2+1 dimensions. For this purpose we construct the Green function of the two-dimensional Dirac equation with Coulomb and AB potentials (via the regular and irregular solutions of the radial Dirac equation) and calculate the vacuum polarization charge density in these fields in the so-called subcritical and supercritical regimes. The role of the self-adjoint extension parameter is discussed in terms of the physics of problem. We hope that our results will be helpful in the more deep understanding the fundamental problem of quantum electrodynamics and can be applied to the problems of charged impurity screening in graphene with taking into consideration the electron spin.

abstract: We study the problem of two interacting particles in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice of the Harper model. We show that a short or long range interaction between particles leads to emergence of delocalized pairs in the non-interacting localized phase. The properties of these Freed by Interaction Kinetic States (FIKS) are analyzed numerically including the advanced Arnoldi method. We find that the number of sites populated by FIKS pairs grows algebraically with the system size with the maximal exponent $b=1$, up to a largest lattice size $N=10946$ reached in our numerical simulations, thus corresponding to a complete delocalization of pairs. For delocalized FIKS pairs the spectral properties of such quasiperiodic operators represent a deep mathematical problem. We argue that FIKS pairs can be detected in the framework of recent cold atom experiments [M.~Schreiber {\it et al.} Science {\bf 349}, 842 (2015)] by a simple setup modification. We also discuss possible implications of FIKS pairs for electron transport in the regime of charge-density wave and high $T_c$ superconductivity.

abstract: We show that if a closed, oriented 3-manifold M is secretly homeomorphic to a lens space L(n,k), then we can compute n and k in randomized polynomial time (in the size of the triangulation of M) with a discrete logarithm oracle. Using Shor's algorithm, a quantum computer can thus identify lens spaces in quantum polynomial time. In addition, k can be computed in functional NP. A given value of k can be certified in randomized polynomial time, specifically in coRP. The idea of the algorithm is to calculate Reidemeister torsion over a prime field that has nth roots of unity.

abstract: We propose to realize and observe Chern Kondo insulators in an optical superlattice with laser-assisted $s$ and $p$ orbital hybridization and synthetic gauge field, which can be engineered based on the recent cold atom experiments. Considering a double-well square optical lattice, the localized $s$ orbitals are decoupled from itinerant $p$ bands and are driven into a Mott insulator due to strong Hubbard interaction. Raman laser beams are then applied to induce tunnelings between $s$ and $p$ orbitals, and generate a staggered flux simultaneously. Due to the strong Hubbard interaction of $s$ orbital states, we predict the existence of a critical Raman laser-assisted coupling, beyond which the Kondo screening is achieved and then a fully gapped Chern Kondo phase emerges, with the topology characterized by integer Chern numbers. Being a strongly correlated topological state, the Chern Kondo phase is different from the single-particle quantum anomalous Hall state, and can be identified by measuring the band topology and double occupancy of $s$ orbitals. The experimental realization and detection of the predicted Chern Kondo insulator are also proposed.

abstract: Two electronic channels competing to screen a single impurity spin, as in the two-channel Kondo model, are expected to generate a ground state with nontrivial entanglement structure. We exploit a spin-chain representation of the two channel Kondo model to probe the ground-state block entropy, negativity, tangle, and Schmidt gap, using a density matrix renormalization group approach. In the presence of symmetric coupling to the two channels we confirm field theoretic predictions for the boundary entropy difference, $\ln (g_{UV}/g_{IR})=\ln(2)/2$, between the ultraviolet and infrared limits and the leading $\ln(x)/x$ impurity correction to the block entropy. The impurity entanglement, $S_{\text{imp}}$, is shown to scale with the characteristic length $\xi_{2CK}$. We show that both the Schmidt gap and the entanglement of the impurity with one of the channels $-$ as measured by the negativity$-$ faithfully serve as order parameters for the impurity quantum phase transition appearing as a function of channel asymmetry, allowing for explicit determination of critical exponents, $\nu\!\approx\! 2$ and $\beta \!\approx\! 0.2$. Finally, we find the emergence of tripartite entanglement, measured by the tangle, only in the vicinity of the critical point.

abstract: In a complex system, the individual components are neither so tightly coupled or correlated that they can all be treated as a single unit, nor so uncorrelated that they can be approximated as independent entities. Instead, patterns of interdependency lead to structure at multiple scales of organization. Evolution excels at producing such complex structures. In turn, the existence of these complex interrelationships within a biological system affects the evolutionary dynamics of that system. I present a mathematical formalism for multiscale structure, grounded in information theory, which makes these intuitions quantitative, and I show how dynamics defined in terms of population genetics or evolutionary game theory can lead to multiscale organization. For complex systems, "more is different," and I address this from several perspectives. Spatial host--consumer models demonstrate the importance of the structures which can arise due to dynamical pattern formation. Evolutionary game theory reveals the novel effects which can result from multiplayer games, nonlinear payoffs and ecological stochasticity. Replicator dynamics in an environment with mesoscale structure relates to generalized conditionalization rules in probability theory. The idea of natural selection "acting at multiple levels" has been mathematized in a variety of ways, not all of which are equivalent. We will face down the confusion, using the experience developed over the course of this thesis to clarify the situation.

In addition, results of rigorous analysis of the behaviour of these solutions when the time tends to infinity and when the small parameter tends to zero are cited. These analyses lead us to mention some of the open problems.

abstract: This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to the quantum mechanical path integral and its use in proving index theorems in geometry, specifically the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern theorem and Lefschetz fixed point theorem. It also touches on some other important concepts in mathematical physics, such as that of stationary phase, supersymmetry and localization. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduates, with no previous knowledge beyond undergraduate quantum mechanics assumed. The necessary mathematical background in differential geometry is reviewed, though a familiarity with this material is undoubtedly helpful.

abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an innovative technology which exploits the laws of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute unconditionally secure cryptographic keys. While QKD offers the promise of unconditionally secure key distribution, real world systems are built from non-ideal components which necessitates the need to model and understand the impact these non-idealities have on system performance and security. OMNeT++ has been used as a basis to develop a simulation framework to support this endeavor. This framework, referred to as "qkdX" extends OMNeT++'s module and message abstractions to efficiently model optical components, optical pulses, operating protocols and processes. This paper presents the design of this framework including how OMNeT++'s abstractions have been utilized to model quantum optical components, optical pulses, fiber and free space channels. Furthermore, from our toolbox of created components, we present various notional and real QKD systems, which have been studied and analyzed.

abstract: We study the problem of estimating the magnitude of a Gaussian beam displacement using a two pixel or 'split' detector. We calculate the maximum likelihood estimator, and compute its asymptotic mean-squared-error via the Fisher information. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is known to be simply related to the Fisher information under idealised detection, we find the two measures of precision differ markedly for a split detector. We show that a greater signal-to-noise ratio 'before' the detector leads to a greater information penalty, unless adaptive realignment is used. We find that with an initially balanced split detector, tuning the normalised difference in counts to 0.884753... gives the highest posterior Fisher information, and that this provides an improvement by at least a factor of about 2.5 over operating in the usual linear regime. We discuss the implications for weak-value amplification, a popular probabilistic signal amplification technique.

abstract: Interactions induced by electromagnetic fluctuations, such as van der Waals and Casimir forces, are of universal nature present at any length scale between any types of systems with finite dimensions. Such interactions are important not only for the fundamental science of materials behavior, but also for the design and improvement of micro- and nano-structured devices. In the past decade, many new materials have become available, which has stimulated the need of understanding their dispersive interactions. The field of van der Waals and Casimir forces has experienced an impetus in terms of developing novel theoretical and computational methods to provide new insights in related phenomena. The understanding of such forces has far reaching consequences as it bridges concepts in materials, atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, chemistry and biology. In this review, we summarize major breakthroughs and emphasize the common origin of van der Waals and Casimir interactions. We examine progress related to novel ab initio modeling approaches and their application in various systems, interactions in materials with Dirac-like spectra, force manipulations through nontrivial boundary conditions, and applications of van der Waals forces in organic and biological matter. The outlook of the review is to give the scientific community a materials perspective of van der Waals and Casimir phenomena and stimulate the development of experimental techniques and applications.

abstract: We present closed-form analytic solutions to non-secular Bloch-Redfield master equations for quantum dynamics of a V-type system driven by weak coupling to a thermal bath. We focus on noise-induced Fano coherences among the excited states induced by incoherent driving of the V-system initially in the ground state. For suddenly turned-on incoherent driving, the time evolution of the coherences is determined by the damping parameter $\zeta=\frac{1}{2}(\gamma_1+\gamma_2)/\Delta_p$, where $\gamma_i$ are the radiative decay rates of the excited levels $i=1,2$, and $\Delta_p=\sqrt{\Delta^2 + (1-p^2)\gamma_1\gamma_2}$ depends on the excited-state level splitting $\Delta>0$ and the angle between the transition dipole moments in the energy basis. The coherences oscillate as a function of time in the underdamped limit ($\zeta\gg1$), approach a long-lived quasi-steady state in the overdamped limit ($\zeta\ll 1$), and display an intermediate behavior at critical damping ($\zeta= 1$). The sudden incoherent turn-on generates a mixture of excited eigenstates $|e_1\rangle$ and $|e_2\rangle$ {\it and their in-phase coherent superposition} $|\phi_+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\bar{r}}}(\sqrt{r_1} |e_1\rangle + \sqrt{r_2}|e_2\rangle)$, which is remarkably long-lived in the overdamped limit (where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the incoherent pumping rates). Formation of this coherent superposition {\it enhances} the decay rate from the excited states to the ground state. In the strongly asymmetric V-system where the coupling strengths between the ground state and the excited states differ significantly, we identify additional asymptotic quasistationary coherences, which arise due to slow equilibration of one of the excited states. Finally, we demonstrate that noise-induced Fano coherences are maximized with respect to populations when $r_1=r_2$ and the transition dipole moments are fully aligned.

abstract: In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, quantum models for semiconductor materials are generally not exactly solvable. As a result, understanding of the strong spin-orbit coupling effects in these systems remains poor. Here we develop an analytical method to solve the one-dimensional hard-wall quantum dot problem in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, which allows us to obtain exact eigenenergies and eigenstates of a single electron. With the help of the exact solution, we demonstrate some unique effects from the strong spin-orbit coupling in a semiconductor quantum dot, in particular the anisotropy of the electron g-factor and its tunability.

The resulting worldline representation can be evaluated by worldline Monte-Carlo methods in continuous spacetime. We benchmark this worldline numerical algorithm with the aid of analytically accessible single-plate and parallel-plate Casimir configurations, providing a detailed analysis of statistical and systematic errors. The method generalizes straightforwardly to arbitrary Casimir geometries and general background potentials.

abstract: We investigate the possibility of constructing Kochen-Specker uncolorable sets of idempotent matrices whose entries lie in various rings, including the rational numbers, the integers, and finite fields. Most notably, we show that there is no Kochen-Specker coloring of the $n \times n$ idempotent integer matrices for $n \geq 3$, thereby illustrating that Kochen-Specker contextuality is an inherent feature of pure matrix algebra. We apply this to generalize recent no-go results on noncommutative spectrum functors, showing that any contravariant functor from rings to sets (respectively, topological spaces or locales) that restricts to the Zariski prime spectrum functor for commutative rings must assign the empty set (respectively, empty space or locale) to the matrix ring $M_n(R)$ for any integer $n \geq 3$ and any ring $R$. An appendix by Alexandru Chirvasitu shows that Kochen-Specker colorings of idempotents in partial subalgebras of $M_3(F)$ for a perfect field $F$ can be extended to partial algebra morphisms into the algebraic closure of $F$.

abstract: This paper attempts to establish the connection among classifications of gapped boundaries in topological phases of matter, bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates in quantum error-correcting codes. We begin by presenting constructions of gapped boundaries for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycles functions ($d\geq 2$). We point out that the system supports $m$-dimensional excitations ($m<d$), which we shall call fluctuating charges, that are superpositions of point-like electric charges characterized by $m$-dimensional bosonic SPT wavefunctions. There exist gapped boundaries where electric charges or magnetic fluxes may not condense by themselves, but may condense only when accompanied by fluctuating charges. Magnetic fluxes and codimension-$2$ fluctuating charges exhibit non-trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, involving more than two excitations. The statistical angle can be computed by taking slant products of underlying cocycle functions sequentially. We find that excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary can be characterized by trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, generalizing the notion of the Lagrangian subgroup. As an application, we construct fault-tolerantly implementable logical gates for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycle functions. Namely, corresponding logical gates belong to the $d$th level of the Clifford hierarchy, but are outside of the $(d-1)$th level, if cocycle functions have non-trivial sequences of slant products.

abstract: We study "field space entanglement" in certain quantum field theories consisting of N number of free scalar fields interacting with each other via kinetic mixing terms. We present exact analytic expressions for entanglement end Renyi entropies between arbitrary number of scalar fields by which we could explore certain entanglement inequalities. Other entanglement measures such as mutual information and entanglement negativity have also been studied. We also give some comments about possible holographic realizations of such models.

abstract: Plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering can push single-molecule vibrational spectroscopy beyond a regime addressable by classical electrodynamics. We employ a quantum electrodynamics (QED) description of the coherent interaction of plasmons and molecular vibrations that reveal the emergence of nonlinearities in the inelastic response of the system. For realistic situations, we predict the onset of \textit{phonon-stimulated Raman scattering} and an counter-intuitive dependence of the anti-Stokes emission on the frequency of excitation. We further show that this novel QED framework opens a venue to analyze the correlations of photons emitted at a plasmonic cavity

abstract: Room-temperature semiconductor quantum dot excitons in InGaN nanostructures used as single and entangled state photon sources could have a large impact in many areas of quantum information including quantum cryptography,1-2 quantum computation3-4 and quantum metrology,5 where currently solid state devices have required cryogenic cooling. Here we present coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy data on an ensemble of In0.54Ga0.46N dots-in-nanowires (DINWs) that show pronounced resonances that persist up to room temperature in the nonlinear optical spectrum, a finding that we show is consistent with the presence of self-formed quantum dot excitons in the system. The data enables the first demonstration measurement of optical absorption by DINW excitons which is differentiated from radiative background states formed by material disorder. This finding opens up the way to the possible engineering of these structures for single photon emitters and quantum devices at room temperature.

abstract: We discuss the universal nature of relaxation in isolated many-body quantum systems subjected to global and strong periodic driving. Our rigorous Floquet analysis shows that the energy of the system remains almost constant up to an exponentially long time in frequency for arbitrary initial states and that an effective Hamiltonian obtained by a truncation of the Floquet-Magnus expansion is a quasi-conserved quantity for long time scale. These two general properties lead to intriguing classification on the initial stage of relaxation, one of which is similar to the prethermalization phenomenon in quasi-integrable systems.

abstract: Secrecy issues of free-space optical links realizing information theoretically secure communications as well as high transmission rates are discussed. We numerically study secrecy communication rates of optical wiretap channel based on on-off keying modulation under typical conditions met in satellite-ground links. It is shown that under reasonable degraded conditions on a wiretapper, information theoretically secure communications should be possible in a much wider distance range than a range limit of quantum key distribution, enabling secure optical links between geostationary earth orbit satellites and ground stations with currently available technologies. We also provide the upper bounds on the decoding error probability and the leaked information to estimate a necessary code length for given required levels of performances. This result ensures that a reasonable length wiretap channel code for our proposed scheme must exist.

We derive the effective low-energy gravitational potentials for slow fermions, coupled to the gravitational field of the Earth, the chameleon field and to torsion with minimal and non-minimal couplings.

abstract: We report on a study of topological properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals. Chern numbers which label the dense set of spectral gaps, are shown to result from the underlying palindromic symmetry. Topological and spectral features are related to the two independent phases of the scattering matrix: the total phase shift describing the frequency spectrum and the chiral phase sensitive to topological features. Conveniently designed gap modes with spectral properties directly related to the Chern numbers allow to scan these phases. An effective topological Fabry-Perot cavity is presented.

abstract: We study theoretically the squeezing spectrum and second-order correlation function of the output light for an optomechanical system in which a mechanical oscillator modulates the cavity linewidth (dissipative coupling). We find strong squeezing coinciding with the normal-mode frequencies of the linearized system. In contrast to dispersive coupling, squeezing is possible in the resolved-sideband limit simultaneously with sideband cooling. The second-order correlation function shows damped oscillations, whose properties are given by the mechanical-like, the optical-like normal mode, or both, and can be below shot-noise level at finite times, $g^{(2)} (\tau) < 1$.

abstract: It was shown that quantum mechanical qubit states as elements of two dimensional complex space can be generalized to elements of even subalgebra of geometric (Clifford) algebra over Euclidian space. The construction critically depends on generalization of formal, unspecified, complex plane to arbitrary variable, but explicitly defined, planes in 3D, and of usual Hopf fibration to maps generated by arbitrary unit value bivectors. Analysis of the new structure demonstrates that quantum state evolution in terms of two dimensional complex space gives only restricted information compared to that in even geometric algebra.

This realization has been enabled by the demonstration of a novel kind of Feshbach resonance occurring in the scattering of two 173Yb atoms in different nuclear and electronic states. The strongly interacting regime at resonance is evidenced by the observation of anisotropic hydrodynamic expansion of the two-orbital Fermi gas. These results pave the way towards the realization of new quantum states of matter with strongly correlated fermions with orbital degree of freedom.

abstract: A recent debate has ensued over the claim in Ref. 1 that systems with internal degrees of freedom undergo a universal, gravity-induced, type of decoherence that explains their quantum-to-classical transition. Such decoherence is supposed to arise from the different gravitational redshifts experienced by such systems when placed in a superposition of two wave packets at different heights in a gravitational field. Here we investigate some aspects of the discussion with the aid of simple examples. In particular, we first resolve an apparent conflict between the reported results and the equivalence principle by noting that the static and free fall descriptions focus on states associated with different hypersurfaces. Next, we emphasize that predictions regarding the observability of interference become relevant only in the context of concrete experimental settings. As a result, we caution against hasty claims of universal validity. Finally, we dispute the claim that, at least in the scenarios discussed in Ref. 1, gravitation is responsible for the reported results and we question the alleged ability of decoherence to explain the quantum-to-classical transition. In consequence, we argue against the extraordinary assertion in Ref. 1 that gravity can account for the emergence of classicality.

abstract: Quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians is currently a very active field of research, using different implementations such as trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or ultracold atoms in optical lattices. All of these approaches have their own assets and limitations. Here, we report on a novel platform for quantum simulation of spin systems, using individual atoms trapped in highly-tunable two-dimensional arrays of optical microtraps, that interact via strong, anisotropic interactions when excited to Rydberg $D$-states. We illustrate the versatility of our system by studying the dynamics of an Ising-like spin-$1/2$ system in a transverse field with up to thirty spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions, and for a wide range of interaction strengths. Our data agree well with numerical simulations of the spin-$1/2$ model except at long times, where we observe deviations that we attribute to the multilevel structure of Rydberg $D$-states.

abstract: We investigate some particular completely positive maps which admit a stable commutative Von Neumann subalgebra. The restriction of such maps to the stable algebra is then a Markov operator. In the first part of this article, we propose a recipe in order to find a quantum extension of a given Markov operator in the above sense. We show that the existence of such an extension is linked with the existence of a special form of dilation for the Markov operator studied by Attal in \cite{Att1}, reducing the problem to the extension of dynamical system. We then apply our method to the same problem in continuous time, proving the existence of a quantum extension for L\'evy processes. In the second part of this article, we focus on the case where the commutative algebra is isomorphic to $\Acal=l^\infty(1,...,N)$ with $N$ either finite or infinite. We propose a classification of the CP maps leaving $\Acal$ stable, producing physical examples of each classes.

abstract: We consider the question whether electromagnetism can be derived from quantum physics of measurements. It turns out that this is possible, both for quantum and classical electromagnetism, if we use more recent innovations such as smearing of observables and simultaneous measurability. In this way we justify the use of von Neumann-type measurement models for physical processes. We apply operational quantum measurement theory to gain insight in fundamental aspects of quantum physics. Interactions of von Neumann type make the Heisenberg evolution of observables describable using explicit operator deformations. In this way one can obtain quantized electromagnetism as a measurement of a system by another. The relevant deformations (Rieffel deformations) have a mathematically well-defined "classical" limit which is indeed classical electromagnetism for our choice of interaction.

abstract: We show how to exploit algebraic relations of operators (or matrices) which constitute the non-equilibrium matrix product steady state of a boundary driven quantum spin chain to find partial differential equations determining all the $m$-point correlation functions in the continuum limit. These partial differential equations, the order of which is determined by scaling of the non-equilibrium partition function, are readily solved if we also know the boundary conditions. In this way we can avoid resorting to representation theory of the matrix product algebra. We apply our methods to study the distributions, or moments, of the magnetization and the spin current observables in boundary driven open XXZ spin chains, as well as some connected correlation functions and find that the transverse connected correlation functions are thermodynamically non-decaying and long-range at the isotropic point $\Delta=1$.

abstract: We investigate the conditions under which the non equilibrium steady state of an open quantum system described by a Lindblad master equation becomes pure in the Zeno regime, i.e., for infinitely large dissipative coupling. The criterion we obtain replaces Yamamoto's criterion [Phys. Rev. A 72, 024104 (2005)] formulated for arbitrary coupling strength. Using our criterion, we investigate an open $XXZ$ spin $1/2$ chain driven out of equilibrium by boundary reservoirs targeting different spin orientations. In the Zeno regime we find two families of pure nonequilibrium steady states, both in the critical and gapped $XXZ$ regimes. These solutions correspond to particular values of the anisotropy parameter measuring the spin orientation difference between two consecutive sites. In the thermodynamic limit, the set of parameters corresponding to the existence of pure solutions becomes dense in a subset of anisotropies.

abstract: Alkali-filled hollow-core fibres are a promising medium for investigating light-matter interactions, especially at the single-photon level, due to the tight confinement of light and high optical depths achievable by light-induced atomic desorption. However, until now these large optical depths could only be generated for seconds at most once per day, severely limiting the practicality of the technology. Here we report the generation of highest observed transient ($>10^5$ for up to a minute) and highest observed persistent ($>2000$ for hours) optical depths of alkali vapours in a light-guiding geometry to date, using a caesium-filled Kagom\'e-type hollow-core photonic crystal fibre. Our results pave the way to light-matter interaction experiments in confined geometries requiring long operation times and large atomic number densities, such as generation of single-photon-level nonlinearities and development of single photon quantum memories.

abstract: Quantum adiabatic evolution is perceived as useful for binary quadratic programming problems that are a priori unconstrained. For constrained problems, it is a common practice to relax linear equality constraints as penalty terms in the objective function. However, there has not yet been proposed a method for efficiently dealing with inequality constraints using the quantum adiabatic approach. In this paper, we give a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a binary quadratic programming (BQP) problem in the presence of inequality constraints and employ this procedure within a branch-and-bound framework for constrained BQP (CBQP) problems.

abstract: We investigate causality constraints on the time evolution of entanglement entropy after a global quench in relativistic theories. We first provide a general proof that the so-called tsunami velocity is bounded by the speed of light. We then generalize the free particle streaming model of arXiv:cond-mat/0503393 to general dimensions and to an arbitrary entanglement pattern of the initial state. In more than two spacetime dimensions the spread of entanglement in these models is highly sensitive to the initial entanglement pattern, but we are able to prove an upper bound on the normalized rate of growth of entanglement entropy, and hence the tsunami velocity. The bound is smaller than what one gets for quenches in holographic theories, which highlights the importance of interactions in the spread of entanglement in many-body systems. We propose an interacting model which we believe provides an upper bound on the spread of entanglement for interacting relativistic theories. In two spacetime dimensions with multiple intervals, this model and its variations are able to reproduce intricate results exhibited by holographic theories for a significant part of the parameter space. For higher dimensions, the model bounds the tsunami velocity at the speed of light. Finally, we construct a geometric model for entanglement propagation based on a tensor network construction for global quenches.

abstract: We show that the edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator can be used to construct a solid state Stern-Gerlach spin-splitter. By threading such a Stern-Gerlach apparatus with a magnetic flux, Ahranov-Bohm like interference effects are introduced. Using ferromagnetic leads, the setup can be used to both measure magnetic flux and as a spintronics switch. With normal metallic leads a switchable spintronics NOT-gate can be implemented. Furthermore, we show that a sequence of such devices can be used to construct a single-qubit $SU(2)$-gate, one of the two gates required for a universal quantum computer. The field sensitivity, or switching field, $b$ is related to the device characteristic size $r$ through $b = \frac{\hbar}{qr^2}$, with $q$ the unit of electric charge.

The simplicity of the access scheme suggests that a functional code might be in close experimental reach.

Results are best modeled with a dielectric plasma response with magnetic properties included. Neither a Drude nor a plasma dielectric response provide a satisfactory description if the magnetic properties are disregarded.

abstract: The possibility that anyons - quantum particles other than fermions or bosons - can emerge in condensed matter systems has motivated generations of physicists. In addition to being of fundamental scientific importance, so-called non-Abelian anyons are particularly sought-after for potential applications to quantum computing. However, experimental evidence of anyons in electronic systems remains inconclusive. In this paper, we propose to demonstrate non-Abelian braiding statistics by injecting coherent states of light into "topological guided modes" in specially-fabricated photonic waveguide arrays. These modes are photonic analogues of topological zero modes in electronic systems. Light traveling inside spatially well-separated topological guided modes can be braided, leading to the accumulation of non-Abelian phases. We propose an optical interference experiment to probe this non-Abelian braiding statistics directly.

abstract: The recently proposed ER=EPR correspondence postulates the existence of wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridges) between entangled states (such as EPR pairs). Entanglement is famously known to be unobservable in quantum mechanics, in that there exists no observable (or, equivalently, projector) that can accurately pick out whether a generic state is entangled. Many features of the geometry of spacetime, however, are observables, so one might worry that the presence or absence of a wormhole could identify an entangled state in ER=EPR, violating quantum mechanics, specifically, the property of state-independence of observables. In this note, we establish that this cannot occur: there is no measurement in general relativity that unambiguously detects the presence of a generic wormhole geometry. This statement is the ER=EPR dual of the undetectability of entanglement.

The fraction of correlated pairs is suppressed by the presence of additional particle and another uncorrelated two-body orbital dominates in the ground-state of the system.

We find that the disorder-averaged (single-particle) Green's function, calculated via the coherent potential approximation, is in very good agreement with exact numerics. Using the transfer-matrix method, we compute the phase diagram in the energy-disorder plane and show that its peculiar shape can be understood from the self-consistent theory of localization. In particular, we recover the large asymmetry in the position of the mobility edge for blue and red speckles, which was recently observed numerically for correlated speckle potentials.

abstract: We develop a variational approximation to the entanglement entropy for scalar $\phi^4$ theory in 1+1, 2+1, and 3+1 dimensions, and then examine the entanglement entropy as a function of the coupling. We find that in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, the entanglement entropy of $\phi^4$ theory as a function of coupling is monotonically decreasing and convex. While $\phi^4$ theory with positive bare coupling in 3+1 dimensions is thought to lead to a trivial free theory, we analyze a version of $\phi^4$ with infinitesimal negative bare coupling, an asymptotically free theory known as precarious $\phi^4$ theory, and explore the monotonicity and convexity of its entanglement entropy as a function of coupling. Within the variational approximation, the stability of precarious $\phi^4$ theory is related to the sign of the first and second derivatives of the entanglement entropy with respect to the coupling.

The ranges of $B$ in which the asymptotic expressions are applicable have been clarified via a comparison of the numerical results from the analytical expressions and from a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a complete spin-space. It was found that, For $^{87}$Rb, the two analytical expressions, one for a weak and the other one for a strong field, together cover the whole range of $B$ from 0 to infinite. For Na, the analytical expressions are valid only if $B$ is very weak or sufficiently strong.

abstract: A detailed study of the anharmonicity-induced resonances caused by the coupling of center-of-mass and relative motion is presented for a system of two ultracold atoms in single-well potentials. As has been confirmed experimentally, these inelastic confinement-induced resonances are of interest, since they can lead to coherent molecule formation, losses, and heating in ultracold atomic gases. A perturbative model is introduced to describe the resonance positions and the coupling strengths. The validity of the model and the behavior of the resonances for different confinement geometries are analyzed in comparison with exact numerical ab initio calculations. While such resonances have so far only been detected for large positive values of the $s$-wave scattering length, it is found that they are present also for negative $s$-wave scattering lengths, i. e. for attractive interactions. The possibility to coherently tune the resonances by a variation of the external confinement geometry might pave the way for coherent molecule association where magnetic Feshbach resonances are inaccessible.

In this letter we have examined an example in the framework of inflationary cosmology. The resulting spectral predictions are in very good agreement with observations and other models of inflation.

abstract: We report a cascaded optical link of 1100 km for ultra-stable frequency distribution over an Internet fiber network. The link is composed of four spans for which the propagation noise is actively compensated. The robustness and the performance of the link are ensured by five fully automated optoelectronic stations, two of them at the link ends, and three deployed on the field and connecting the spans. This device coherently regenerates the optical signal with the heterodyne optical phase locking of a low-noise laser diode. Optical detection of the beat-note signals for the laser lock and the link noise compensation are obtained with stable and low-noise fibered optical interferometer. We show 3.5 days of continuous operation of the noise-compensated 4-span cascaded link leading to fractional frequency instability of 4x10-16 at 1-s measurement time and 1x10-19 at 2000 s. This cascaded link was extended to 1480-km with the same performance. This work is a significant step towards a sustainable wide area ultra-stable optical frequency distribution and comparison network at a very high level of performance.

abstract: We report branches of explicit expressions for nonlinear modes in parity-time (PT) symmetric potentials of several types. For the single-well and double-well potentials the found solutions are two-parametric and appear to be stable even when the PT-symmetry of respective underlying linear models is broken. Based on the examples of these solutions we describe an algorithm of excitation of a stable nonlinear mode in a model, whose linear limit is unstable. The method is based on the adiabatic change of the control parameter driving the mode along a branch bifurcating from a stable linear mode. The suggested algorithm is confirmed by extensive numerical simulations.

abstract: We present a unified theoretical study of the bright solitons governed by self-focusing and defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations with generalized parity-time (PT)-symmetric Scarff II potentials. Particularly, a PT-symmetric k-wavenumber Scarff II potential and a multi-well Scarff II potential are considered, respectively. For the k-wavenumber Scarff II potential, the parameter space can be divided into different regions, corresponding to unbroken and broken PT-symmetry and the bright solitons for self-focusing and defocusing Kerr nonlinearities. For the multi-well Scarff II potential the bright solitons can be obtained by using a periodically space-modulated Kerr nonlinearity. The linear stability of bright solitons with PT-symmetric k-wavenumber and multi-well Scarff II potentials is analyzed in details using numerical simulations. Stable and unstable bright solitons are found in both regions of unbroken and broken PT-symmetry due to the existence of the nonlinearity. Furthermore, the bright solitons in three-dimensional self-focusing and defocusing NLS equations with a generalized PT-symmetric Scarff II potential are explored. This may have potential applications in the field of optical information transmission and processing based on optical solitons in nonlinear dissipative but PT-symmetric systems.

abstract: This thesis is divided into two mainly independent parts: In the first part, we derive a criterion to determine when a translationally invariant Matrix Product State (MPS) has long range localizable entanglement, which indicates that the corresponding state has some kind of non-local hidden order. We give examples fulfilling this criterion and eventually use it to obtain all such MPS with bond dimension 2 and 3. In the second part, we show that Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) in two spatial dimensions can describe chiral topological states by explicitly constructing a family of such states with a non-trivial Chern number. We demonstrate that such free fermionic PEPS must necessarily be non-injective and have gapless parent Hamiltonians. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence that they can nevertheless approximate well the physical properties of Chern insulators with local Hamiltonians at arbitrary temperatures. We also construct long range, topological Hamiltonians with a flat energy spectrum for which those PEPS are unique ground states. As for non-chiral topological PEPS, the non-trivial, topological properties can be traced down to the existence of a symmetry on the virtual level of the PEPS tensor that is used to build the state. We use the special properties of PEPS to build the boundary theory and show how the symmetry results in the appearance of chiral modes, a ground state degeneracy of the parent Hamiltonian on the torus and a universal correction to the area law for the zero R\'enyi entropy. Finally, we show that PEPS can also describe chiral topologically ordered phases. For that, we construct a simple PEPS for spin-1/2 particles in a two-dimensional lattice. We reveal a symmetry of the PEPS tensor that gives rise to the global topological character. We also extract characteristic quantities of the edge Conformal Field Theory using the bulk-boundary correspondence.

abstract: Recent experiments have shown that (quasi-)crystalline phases of Rydberg-dressed quantum many-body systems in optical lattices (OL) are within reach. While conventional neutral atomic OL gases lack strong long-range interactions, these arise naturally in Rydberg systems, due to the large polarizability of Rydberg atoms. Combined with the bosonic character of the systems considered in our work, a wide range of quantum phases have been predicted. Among them are a devil's staircase of lattice incommensurate density wave phases as well as more exotic supersolid lattice order. High experimental tunability opens up a wide range of parameters to be studied. Guided by results in the "frozen" gas limit, we study the ground state phase diagram at finite hopping amplitudes and in the vicinity of resonant Rydberg driving. Simulations within real-space bosonic dynamical mean-field theory (RB-DMFT) yield an extension of the devil's staircase into the supersolid regime where the competition of condensation and interaction leads to a sequence of crystalline phases.

abstract: Let $H$ be a fixed graph on $n$ vertices. Let $f_H(G) = 1$ iff the input graph $G$ on $n$ vertices contains $H$ as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph. Let $\alpha_H$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set of $H$. In this paper we show: \[Q(f_H) = \Omega\left(\sqrt{\alpha_H \cdot n}\right),\] where $Q(f_H)$ denotes the quantum query complexity of $f_H$. As a consequence we obtain a lower bounds for $Q(f_H)$ in terms of several other parameters of $H$ such as the average degree, minimum vertex cover, chromatic number, and the critical probability. We also use the above bound to show that $Q(f_H) = \Omega(n^{3/4})$ for any $H$, improving on the previously best known bound of $\Omega(n^{2/3})$. Until very recently, it was believed that the quantum query complexity is at least square root of the randomized one. Our $\Omega(n^{3/4})$ bound for $Q(f_H)$ matches the square root of the current best known bound for the randomized query complexity of $f_H$, which is $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ due to Gr\"oger. Interestingly, the randomized bound of $\Omega(\alpha_H \cdot n)$ for $f_H$ still remains open. We also study the Subgraph Homomorphism Problem, denoted by $f_{[H]}$, and show that $Q(f_{[H]}) = \Omega(n)$. Finally we extend our results to the $3$-uniform hypergraphs. In particular, we show an $\Omega(n^{4/5})$ bound for quantum query complexity of the Subgraph Isomorphism, improving on the previously known $\Omega(n^{3/4})$ bound. For the Subgraph Homomorphism, we obtain an $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ bound for the same.

abstract: Entangling two quantum bits by letting them interact is the crucial requirements for building a quantum processor. For qubits based on the spin of the electron, these two-qubit gates are typically performed by exchange interaction of the electrons captured in two nearby quantum dots. Since the exchange interaction relies on tunneling of the electrons, the range of interaction for conventional approaches is severely limited as the tunneling amplitude decays exponentially with the length of the tunneling barrier. Here, we present a novel approach to couple two spin qubits via a superconducting coupler. In essence, the superconducting coupler provides a tunneling barrier for the electrons which can be tuned with exquisite precision. We show that as a result exchange couplings over a distance of several microns become realistic, thus enabling flexible designs of multi-qubit systems.

abstract: This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), its basis, and its implications to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of ideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory. To this end, we present a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as random matrix theory and some of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of energy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables. Building on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe thermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an external bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from studies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench as a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results of numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review explores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic thermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems, and the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum chaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian eigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles. We then show how one can use these relations to obtain non-trivial universal energy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review, we briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of integrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept of the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of prethermalization in weakly interacting systems.

abstract: We study the effect of frustration on the entanglement of non-equilibrium finite-spin systems with external fields using a new method based on thermofield dynamics (TFD). For this purpose, the extended density matrices and the extended entanglement entropies of two systems with either non-competitive or competitive external fields are calculated according to the dissipative von Neumann equation, and the numerical results are compared. Consequently, the effect of frustration on the entanglement of non-equilibrium finite-spin systems with competitive external fields has been clarified in the TFD algorithm.

abstract: Bilayer graphene hosts valley-chiral one dimensional modes at domain walls between regions of different interlayer potential or stacking order. When such a channel is brought into proximity to a superconductor, the two electrons of a Cooper pair which tunnel into it move in opposite directions because they belong to different valleys related by the time-reversal symmetry. This is a kinetic variant of Cooper pair splitting, which requires neither Coulomb repulsion nor energy filtering but is enforced by the robustness of the valley isospin in the absence of atomic-scale defects. We derive an effective model for the guided modes in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, calculate the conductance carried by split and spin-entangled electron pairs, and interpret it as a result of local Andreev reflection processes, whereas crossed Andreev reflection is absent.

abstract: In this article, an analytical description is presented based on the master equation. This master equation is formed from the system of superconducting phase qubit which is coupled to a torsional resonator and damped by a dispersive reservoir. An analytical approach for searching of some physical phenomena on the qubit system is presented, such as qubit inversion, purity and negativity. In addition, these phenomena are discussed for the resonance and off-resonance cases for many different initial states. From computational results, it is found that the mentioned phenomena depend on the dispersive reservoir parameter which leads to their death. However, the complete destruction of system coherence in the presence of dispersive reservoir leads to the death of entanglement between the qubit and torsional resonator.

abstract: Quantum coherence is a fundamental common trait of quantum phenomena, from the interference of matter waves to quantum degeneracy of identical particles. Despite its importance, estimating and measuring quantum coherence in generic, mixed many-body quantum states remains a formidable challenge, with fundamental implications in areas as broad as quantum condensed matter, quantum information, quantum metrology and quantum biology. Here we provide a quantitative definition of the variance of quantum coherent fluctuations (the quantum variance) of any observable on generic quantum states. The quantum variance generalizes the concept of thermal de Broglie wavelength (for the position of a free quantum particle) to the space of eigenvalues of any observable, quantifying the degree of coherent delocalization in that space. The quantum variance is generically measurable and computable as the difference between the static fluctuations and the static susceptibility of the observable; despite its simplicity, it is found to provide a tight lower bound to most widely accepted estimators of "quantumness" of observables (both as a feature as well as a resource), such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information and the quantum Fisher information. When considering bipartite fluctuations in an extended quantum system, the quantum variance expresses genuine quantum correlations (of discord type) among the two parts. In the case of many-body systems it is found to obey an area law at finite temperature, extending therefore area laws of entanglement and quantum fluctuations of pure states to the mixed-state context. Hence the quantum variance paves the way to the measurement of macroscopic quantum coherence and quantum correlations in most complex quantum systems.

abstract: We consider a hydrogen atom confined in a thick brane embedded in a higher-dimensional space. Due to effects of the extra dimensions, the gravitational potential is amplified in distances smaller than the size of the supplementary space, in comparison with the Newtonian potential. Studying the influence of the gravitational interaction modified by the extra dimensions on the energy levels of the hydrogen atom, we find independent constraints for the higher-dimensional Planck mass in terms of the thickness of the brane by using accurate measurements of atomic transition frequencies. The constraints are very stringent for narrow branes.

abstract: Valley currents and non-local resistances of graphene nanostructures with broken inversion symmetry are considered theoretically in the linear response regime. Scattering state wave functions of electrons entering the nanostructure from the contacts represented by groups of ideal leads are calculated by solving the Lippmann- Schwinger equation and are projected onto the valley state subspaces to obtain the valley velocity fields and total valley currents in the nanostructures. In the tunneling regime when the Fermi energy is in the spectral gap around the Dirac point energy, inversion symmetry breaking is found to result in strong enhancement of the nonlocal 4 terminal Buttiker-Landauer resistance and in valley currents several times stronger than the conventional electric current. These strong valley currents are the direct result of the injection of electrons from a contact into the graphene in the tunneling regime. They are chiral and occur near contacts from which electrons are injected into the nanostructure whether or not a net electric current flows through the contact. It is also pointed out that enhanced non-local resistances in the linear response regime are not a signature of valley currents arising from the combined effect of the electric field and Berry curvature on the velocities of electrons.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1509.06870
abstract: An analytical approach is developed to the problem of computation of monotone Riemannian metrics (e.g. Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori, Bures, Chernoff, etc.) on the set of quantum states. The obtained expressions originate from the Morozova, Chencov and Petz correspondence of monotone metrics to operator monotone functions. The used mathematical technique provides analytical expansions in terms of the thermodynamic mean values of iterated (nested) commutators of a model Hamiltonian T with the operator S involved through the control parameter $h$. Due to the sum rules for the frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor new presentations for the monotone Riemannian metrics are obtained. Particularly, relations between any monotone Riemannian metric and the usual thermodynamic susceptibility or the variance of the operator $S$ are discussed. If the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian are given in terms of generators of some Lie algebra, the obtained expansions may be evaluated in a closed form. These issues are tested on a class of model systems studied in condensed matter physics.

abstract: We construct a new set of generalized coherent states, the electron-hole coherent states, for a (quasi-)spin particle on the infinite line. The definition is inspired by applications to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations where the quasi-spin refers to electron- and hole-like components of electronic excitations in a superconductor. Electron-hole coherent states generally entangle the space and the quasi-spin degrees of freedom. We show that the electron-hole coherent states allow obtaining a resolution of unity and form minimum uncertainty states for position and velocity where the velocity operator is defined using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. The usefulness and the limitations of electron-hole coherent states and the phase space representations built from them are discussed in terms of basic applications to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation such as Andreev reflection.

abstract: Analytic potentials are built for all four $^{2S+1}\Pi_{u/g}$ states of Li$_{2}$ dissociating to Li$(2S)$ + Li$(3P)$: $3b(3^{3}\Pi_{u})$, $3B(3^{1}\Pi_{u})$, $3C(3^{1}\Pi_{g}),$ and $3d(3^{3}\Pi_{g})$. These potentials include the effect of spin-orbit coupling for large internuclear distances, and include state of the art long-range constants. This is the first successful demonstration of fully analytic diatomic potentials that capture features that are usually considered too difficult to capture without a point-wise potential, such as multiple minima, and shelves. Vibrational energies for each potential are presented for the isotopologues $^{6,6}$Li$_{2}$, $^{6,7}$Li$_{2}$, $^{7,7}$Li$_{2}$, and the elusive `halo nucleonic molecule' $^{11,11}$Li$_{2}$. These energies are claimed to be accurate enough for new high-precision experimental setups such as the one presented in {[}Sebastian \emph{et al.} Phys. Rev. A, \textbf{90}, 033417 (2014){]} to measure and assign energy levels of these electronic states, all of which have not yet been explored in the long-range region. Measuring energies in the long-range region of these electronic states may be significant for studying the \emph{ab initio} vs experiment discrepancy discussed in {[}Tang \emph{et al.} Phys. Rev. A, \textbf{84}, 052502 (2014){]} for the $C_{3}$ long-range constant of Lithium, which has significance for improving the SI definition of the second.

abstract: In this short communication I generalize the method of obtaining quasi-Feynman formulas described in my previous paper on that topic. The theorem presented allows to obtain the solution to the Cauchy problem for the Schr\"odinger equation with the Hamiltonian decomposed to a finite sum of operators. The concept of Chernoff tangency is used, and the solution is written in the form of a quasi-Feynman formula as before. Theorem proven is compared to known approximation theorems: Trotter's, Chernoff's, Butko-Schilling-Smolyanov's.

abstract: The idea of topological quantum computation (TQC) is to store and manipulate quantum information in an intrinsically fault-tolerant manner by utilizing the physics of topologically ordered phases of matter. Currently, one of the most promising platforms for a topological qubit is in terms of Majorana fermion zero modes (MZMs) in spin-orbit coupled superconducting nanowires. However, the topologically robust operations that are possible with MZMs can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer and are therefore not sufficient for realizing a universal gate set for TQC. Here, we show that an array of coupled semiconductor-superconductor nanowires with MZM edge states can be used to realize a more sophisticated type of non-Abelian defect: a genon in an Ising $\times$ Ising topological state. This leads to a possible implementation of the missing topologically protected $\pi/8$ phase gate and thus universal TQC based on semiconductor-superconductor nanowire technology. We provide detailed numerical estimates of the relevant energy scales, which we show to lie within accessible ranges.

title: Ten reasons why a thermalized system cannot be described by a many-particle wave function

abstract: It is widely believed that the underlying reality behind statistical mechanics is a deterministic and unitary time evolution of a many-particle wave function, even though this is in conflict with the irreversible, stochastic nature of statistical mechanics. The usual attempts to resolve this conflict for instance by appealing to decoherence or eigenstate thermalization are not fully convincing. This paper presents ten arguments why the irreversibility and stochasticity of statistical mechanics should be taken as a true property of nature, and why we should assume that there are limits of validity to a unitary time evolution based on wave functions. The arguments are made for macroscopic systems at finite temperature and are based among others on the classical limit, on extensivity, on the concepts of entropy and equilibrium, and on symmetry braking in phase transitions and quantum measurement. It follows that a gas of a macroscopic number N of atoms in thermal equilibrium is best represented by a collection of N wave packets of a size of the order of the thermal de Broglie wave length, which behave quantum mechanically below this scale but classically sufficiently far beyond this scale. In particular, these wave packets must localize again after scattering events, which requires stochasticity and indicates a connection to the measurement process.

abstract: The known duality relating the quantum $d$-dimensional oscillator and $D$-dimensional Coulomb problems in Euclidean spaces (for $D = (d+2)/2$) is extended to a quantum $d$-dimensional nonlinear oscillator of Mathews-Lakshmanan type (or oscillator in a space of constant curvature), resulting in a quantum $D$-dimensional Coulomb-like problem in a space of nonconstant curvature. Going to an equivalent position-dependent mass description, we establish a duality between a nonlinear oscillator and a (true) Coulomb problem. A special case of the latter for $D=3$ was previously solved by deformed shape invariance and point canonical transformation methods.

abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of strongly interacting four component spin-3/2 ultracold fermionic atoms in the Mott insulator limit with one particle per site in an optical lattice with honeycomb symmetry. In this limit, atomic tunneling is virtual, and only the atomic spins can exchange. We find a competition between symmetry breaking and liquid like disordered phases. Particularly interesting are valence bond states with bond centered magnetizations, situated between the ferromagnetic and conventional valence bond phases. In the framework of a mean-field theory, we calculate the phase diagram and identify an experimentally relevant parameter region where a homogeneous SU(4) symmetric Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki-like valence bond state is present.

abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin in diamond can be used to realize quantum computation and to sense magnetic fields. Its spin triplet consists of three levels labeled with its spin z-components of +1, 0, and -1. Without external field, the +1 and -1 states are degenerate and higher than the 0 state due to the zero-field splitting. By taking the symmetrical and anti-symmetrical superpositions of the +1 and -1 states as our qubit basis, we obtain exact evolution operator of the NV center spin under time-dependent magnetic field by mapping the three-level system on time-dependent quantum two-level systems with exact analytical solutions. With our exact evolution operator of the NV center spin including three levels, we show that arbitrary qubits can be prepared from the starting 0 state and arbitrary rapid quantum logic gates of these qubits can be realized with magnetic fields. In addition, it is made clear that the typical quantum logic gates can be accomplished within a few nanoseconds and the fidelity can be very high because only magnetic field strength needs to be controlled in this approach. These results should be useful to realizing quantum computing with the NV center spin systems in diamond and exploring other effects and applications.

abstract: We establish rigorous error bounds for approximating correlation functions of conformal field theories (CFTs) by certain finite-dimensional tensor networks. For chiral CFTs, the approximation takes the form of a matrix product state. For full CFTs consisting of a chiral and an anti-chiral part, the approximation is given by a finitely correlated state. We show that the bond dimension scales polynomially in the inverse of the approximation error and sub-exponentially in the ultraviolett cutoff. We illustrate our findings using Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between group-covariant MPS and our approximation.

abstract: The Fano effect (U. Fano, Phys. Rev. \textbf{15},1866 (1961) shows that an inelastic scattering process can be suppressed when the output channel (OC) is coupled to an isolated bound state. In this paper we investigate the application of this effect for the suppression of two-body collisional losses of ultracold atoms. The Fano effect is originally derived via a first-order perturbation treatment for coupling between the incident channel (IC) and the OC. We generalize the Fano effect to systems with arbitrarily strong IC--OC couplings. We analytically prove that, in a system with one IC and one OC, when the inter-atomic interaction potentials are real functions of the inter-atomic distance, the exact s-wave inelastic scattering amplitude can always be suppressed to \emph{zero} by coupling between the IC or the OC (or both of them) and an extra isolated bound state. We further show that when the low-energy inelastic collision between two ultracold atoms is suppressed by this effect, the real part of the elastic scattering length between the atoms is still possible to be much larger than the range of inter-atomic interaction.In addition, when open scattering channels are coupled to two bound states, with the help of the Fano effect, independent control of the elastic and inelastic scattering amplitudes of two ultracold atoms can be achieved. Possible experimental realizations of our scheme are also discussed.

abstract: We discuss in detail algorithms for implementing tensor network renormalization (TNR) for the study of classical statistical and quantum many-body systems. Firstly, we recall established techniques for how the partition function of a 2D classical many-body system or the Euclidean path integral of a 1D quantum system can be represented as a network of tensors, before describing how TNR can be implemented to efficiently contract the network via a sequence of coarse-graining transformations. The efficacy of the TNR approach is then benchmarked for the 2D classical statistical and 1D quantum Ising models; in particular the ability of TNR to maintain a high level of accuracy over sustained coarse-graining transformations, even at a critical point, is demonstrated.

abstract: The recently-developed notion of 'parity-time (PT) symmetry' in optical systems with a controlled gain-loss interplay has spawned an intriguing way of achieving optical behaviors that are presently unattainable with standard arrangements. In most experimental studies so far, however, the implementations rely highly on the advances of nanotechnologies and sophisticated fabrication techniques to synthesize solid-state materials. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of optical anti-PT symmetry, a counterpart of conventional PT symmetry, in a warm atomic-vapor cell. By exploiting rapid coherence transport via flying atoms, our scheme illustrates essential features of anti-PT symmetry with an unprecedented precision on phase-transition threshold, and substantially reduces experimental complexity and cost. This result represents a significant advance in non-Hermitian optics by bridging a firm connection with the field of atomic, molecular and optical physics, where novel phenomena and applications in quantum and nonlinear optics aided by (anti-)PT symmetry could be anticipated.

First the authors erroneously claimed that our results contradict the equivalence principle, only to "resolve" the alleged conflict in a second note. The resolution - relativity of simultaneity - was already explained in our reply [arXiv:1508.03296], which Bonder et al. now essentially reiterate. The newly raised points were also already extensively clarified in our note. The physical prediction of our work remains valid: systems with internal dynamics decohere if the superposed paths have different proper times.

abstract: We present characterisations of "exact" gap-definable classes, in terms of indeterministic models of computation which slightly modify the standard model of quantum computation. This follows on work of Aaronson [arXiv:quant-ph/0412187], who shows that the counting class PP can be characterised in terms of bounded-error "quantum" algorithms which use invertible (and possibly non-unitary) transformations, or postselections on events of non-zero probability. Our work considers similar modifications of the quantum computational model, but in the setting of exact algorithms, and algorithms with zero error and constant success probability. We show that the gap-definable counting classes [J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 48 (1994), p.116] which bound exact and zero-error quantum algorithms can be characterised in terms of "quantum-like" algorithms involving nonunitary gates, and that postselection and nonunitarity have equivalent power for exact quantum computation only if these classes collapse.

abstract: High-quality rare-earth-ion (REI) doped materials are a prerequisite for many applications such as quantum memories, ultra-high-resolution optical spectrum analyzers and information processing. Compared to bulk materials, REI doped powders offer low-cost fabrication and a greater range of accessible material systems. Here we show that crystal properties, such as nuclear spin lifetime, are strongly affected by mechanical treatment, and that spectral hole burning can serve as a sensitive method to characterize the quality of REI doped powders. We focus on the specific case of thulium doped Y$_2$Al$_5$O$_{12}$ (Tm:YAG). Different methods for obtaining the powders are compared and the influence of annealing on the spectroscopic quality of powders is investigated. We conclude that annealing can reverse some detrimental effects of powder fabrication and, in certain cases, the properties of the bulk material can be reached. Our results may be applicable to other impurities and other crystals, including color centres in nano-structured diamond.

abstract: Estimates are presented of exotic, purely rotational correlations that arise in large systems if directions in space-time emerge from Planck scale quantum elements with no fixed classical background space. In the time domain, directions to world lines at finite separation $R$ from any world line coherently fluctuate in the classical (that is, $R\rightarrow \infty$) inertial frame, on a timescale $R/c$, by an angle of order $R^{-1/2}$ in Planck units. The exact exotic correlation function is computed for the signal in a Sagnac type interferometer of arbitrary shape. The signal variance is equal to twice the enclosed area divided by the perimeter, in Planck units. It is conjectured that exotic Planck scale rotational correlations, entangled with the strong interactions, determine the value of the cosmological constant. Cosmic acceleration may be viewed heuristically as centrifugal acceleration by rotational fluctuations of the matter vacuum. An experiment concept is sketched, based on a reconfiguration of the Fermilab Holometer.

abstract: Atom interferometry tests of universality of free fall based on the differential measurement of two different atomic species provide a useful complement to those based on macroscopic masses. However, when striving for the highest possible sensitivities, gravity gradients pose a serious challenge. Indeed, the relative initial position and velocity for the two species need to be controlled with extremely high accuracy, which can be rather demanding in practice and whose verification may require rather long integration times. Furthermore, in highly sensitive configurations gravity gradients lead to a drastic loss of contrast. These difficulties can be mitigated by employing wave packets with narrower position and momentum widths, but this is ultimately limited by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We present a novel scheme that simultaneously overcomes the loss of contrast and the initial co-location problem. In doing so, it circumvents the fundamental limitations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and eases the experimental realization by relaxing the requirements on initial co-location by several orders of magnitude.

abstract: We propose a physical realization of a commuting Hamiltonian of interacting Majorana fermions realizing $Z_{2}$ topological order, using an array of Josephson-coupled topological superconductor islands. The required multi-body interaction Hamiltonian is naturally generated by a combination of charging energy induced quantum phase-slips on the superconducting islands and electron tunneling. Our setup improves on a recent proposal for implementing a Majorana fermion surface code [1], a 'hybrid' approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation that combines (1) the engineering of a stabilizer Hamiltonian with a topologically ordered ground state with (2) projective stabilizer measurements to implement error correction and a universal set of logical gates. Our hybrid strategy has advantages over the traditional surface code architecture in error suppression and single-step stabilizer measurements, and is widely applicable to implementing stabilizer codes for quantum computation.

abstract: We consider quantum quenches from an ideal Bose condensate to the Lieb-Liniger model with arbitrary attractive interaction strength. We focus on the properties of the non-equilibrium steady state reached at late times after the quench. Using recently developed methods based on integrability, we obtain an exact description of the stationary state for a large number of bosons. A distinctive feature of this state is the presence of a hierarchy of multi-particle bound states. We determine the dependence of their densities on interaction strength and obtain an exact expression for the stationary value of the local pair correlation $g_2$. We discuss ramifications of our results for cold atom experiments.

abstract: We present a simple model that supports superconductive and antiferromagnetic ordering. The model consists of a system of electrons on a simple cubic lattice that move by tunnel effect and interact via antiferromagnetic Ising spin couplings and short range repulsions: these include infinitely strong Hubbard forces that prevent double occupancy of any lattice site. Hence, under the filling condition of one electron per site and at sufficiently low temperature, the system is an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator. However, when holes are created by suitable doping, they are mobile charge carriers. We show that, at low concentration, their interactions induced by the above interelectronic ones lead to Schafroth pairing. Hence, under certain plausible but unproved assumptions, the model exhibits the off-diagonal long range order that characterises superconductivity, while retaining the antiferromagnetic ordering.

abstract: We present a direct lattice gauge theory computation that, without using dualities, demonstrates that the entanglement entropy of Yang-Mills theories with arbitrary gauge group $G$ contains a generic logarithmic term at sufficiently weak coupling $e$. In two spatial dimensions, for a region of linear size $r$, this term equals $\frac{1}{2} \dim(G) \log\left(e^2 r\right)$ and it dominates the universal part of the entanglement entropy. Such logarithmic terms arise from the entanglement of the softest mode in the entangling region with the environment. For Maxwell theory in two spatial dimensions, our results agree with those obtained by dualizing to a compact scalar with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

abstract: The emerging field of on-chip integration of nanophotonic devices and cold atoms offers extremely-strong and pure light-matter interaction schemes, which may have profound impact on quantum information science. In this context, a longstanding obstacle is to achieve strong interaction between single atoms and single photons, while at the same time trap atoms in vacuum at large separation distances from dielectric surfaces. In this letter, we study new waveguide geometries that challenge these conflicting objectives. The designed photonic crystal waveguide is expected to offer a good compromise, which additionally allow for easy manipulation of atomic clouds around the structure.

Our proof broadly follows theirs, which relies on physically well motivated axioms, but to fill in some crucial details certain technical assumptions have had to be added, whose physical status seems somewhat obscure.

abstract: Practical quantum computers require the construction of a large network of highly coherent qubits, interconnected in a design robust against errors. Donor spins in silicon provide a physical qubit platform compatible with the industry-standard semiconductor processing, together with state-of-the-art coherence and quantum gate fidelities. Here we present a scalable design for a silicon quantum processor that exploits the electric dipole induced on a donor by a top-gated metal-oxide-semiconductor structure. Quantum information can be encoded in either the nuclear spin or the flip-flop states of electron and nucleus. 1-qubit gates are obtained by low power electric and magnetic drive at microwave frequencies, while fast 2-qubit gates are mediated by the induced electric dipole. The scheme allows inter-qubit distances > 150 nm and is highly robust against donor placement uncertainties. Microwave resonators allow for millimeter-distance 2-qubit gates and interfacing with photonic links. The qubit states can be protected from charge noise up to second order, thus preserving the outstanding coherence times of spin qubits in silicon.

We find when the entangled states of two-photon and three-photon pass through photonic crystal, their entanglement degrees can be magnified, which make the entanglement states can be long range propagation and the quantum communication can be really realized.

abstract: In two spatial dimensions, topological order is robust for static deformations at zero temperature, while it is fragile at any finite temperature. How robust is topological order after a quantum quench? In this paper we show that topological order thermalises under the unitary evolution after a quantum quench. If the quench preserves gauge symmetry, there is a residual topological entropy exactly like in the finite temperature case, as discovered by Phys. Rev. B 76, 174416 (2007). We obtain this result by studying the time evolution of the topological 2-Renyi entropy in a fully analytical, exact way. These techniques can be then applied to systems with strong disorder to show whether a many-body localisation phenomenon appears in topologically ordered systems.

In particular, we obtain the Green's functions for a waveguide with an embedded two-level system in the single- and two-excitation sector for arbitrary dispersion relations. In the single excitation sector, we show how to sum the diagrammatic perturbation series to all orders and thus obtain explicit expressions for physical quantities such as the spectral density and the scattering matrix. In the two-excitation sector, we show that strictly linear dispersion relations exhibit the special property that the corresponding diagrammatic perturbation series terminates after two terms, again allowing for closed-form expressions for physical quantities. In the case of general dispersion relations, notably those exhibiting a band edge or waveguide cut-off frequencies, the perturbation series cannot be summed explicitly. Instead, we derive a self-consistent T-matrix equation that reduces the computational effort to that of a single-excitation computation. This analysis allows us to identify a Fano resonance between the occupied quantum impurity and a free photon in the waveguide as a unique signature of the few-photon nonlinearity inherent in such systems. In addition, our diagrammatic approach allows for the classification of different physical processes such as the creation of photon-photon correlations and interaction-induced radiation trapping - the latter being absent for strictly linear dispersion relations. Our framework can serve as the basis for further studies that involve more complex scenarios such as several and many-level quantum impurities, networks of coupled waveguides, disordered systems, and non-equilibrium effects.

abstract: The production of electron-positron pairs in time-dependent electric fields (Schwinger mechanism) depends non-linearly on the applied field profile. Accordingly, the resulting momentum spectrum is extremely sensitive to small variations of the field parameters. Owing to this non-linear dependence it is so far unpredictable how to choose a field configuration such that a predetermined momentum distribution is generated. We show that quantum kinetic theory along with optimal control theory can be used to approximately solve this inverse problem for Schwinger pair production. We exemplify this by studying the superposition of a small number of harmonic components resulting in predetermined signatures in the asymptotic momentum spectrum. In the long run, our results could facilitate the observation of this yet unobserved pair production mechanism in quantum electrodynamics by providing suggestions for tailored field configurations.

abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) was studied in a heated vapor cell of potassium without buffer gas or anti-relaxation coating. Transparency windows 60 times narrower than the natural line width and group indices exceeding 6000 were generated using a simple optical setup with a single free-running laser and an acousto-optic modulator. A longitudinal magnetic field was used to split the EIT feature into three components for either lin$\perp$lin or lin$\parallel$lin polarizations of probe and coupling beams. Measurements of polarization rotation revealed that only the lin$\parallel$lin configuration leads to circular birefringence, an effect which we attribute to quantum interference between the multiple $\Lambda$-type subsystems contributing to the signal. The Verdet constant of the EIT medium was measured to be $(5.8\pm 0.3)\times 10^4$ rad/T/m, and a novel measurement of group index for circular polarization based on birefringence was demonstrated. For larger fields, where the individual peaks were well resolved, resonant polarization rotations of $(210\pm10)$ mrad/MHz were observed.

abstract: Ground state cooling of micromechanical oscillator is a paradigmatic goal for observing quantum mechanical effects in cavity optomechanics. We study theoretically the ground state cooling of a mechanical oscillator in an optomechanical cavity in presence of a quantum well placed inside the cavity. Due to mode tailoring in presence of the quantum well, the cavity response gets modified and leads to asymmetric heating and cooling processes. This facilitates the cooling of the mechanical oscillator even in the unresolved-sideband regime, via inhibition of Stokes scattering.

abstract: Cosmic inflation is commonly assumed to be driven by quantum fields. Quantum mechanics predicts phenomena such as quantum fluctuations and tunneling of the field. Here we show an example of a quantum interference effect which goes beyond the semi-classical treatment and which may be of relevance in the early universe. We study the quantum coherent dynamics for a tilted, periodic potential, which results in genuine quantum oscillations of the inflaton field, analogous to Bloch oscillations in condensed matter and atomic systems. Our results show that quantum interference phenomena may be of relevance in cosmology.

abstract: Following the recent observation of localised phonon polaritons in user-defined silicon carbide nano-resonators, here we demonstrate coherent coupling between those localised modes and propagating phonon polaritons bound to the surface of the nano-resonator's substrate. In order to obtain phase-matching, the nano-resonators have been fabricated to serve the double function of hosting the localised modes, while also acting as grating for the propagating ones. The coherent coupling between long lived, optically accessible localised modes, and low-loss propagative ones, opens the way to the design and realisation of phonon-polariton based quantum circuits.

abstract: A method based on thermal bistability for ultralow-threshold microlaser optimization is demonstrated. When sweeping the pump laser frequency across a pump resonance, the dynamic thermal bistability slows down the power variation. The resulting line shape modification enables a real-time monitoring of the laser characteristic. We demonstrate this method for a functionalized microsphere exhibiting a submicrowatt laser threshold. This approach is confirmed by comparing the results with a step-by-step recording in quasi-static thermal conditions.

abstract: A novel method and nanodevice are introduced that allows to rotate the single electron spin confined in a gated electrostatic InSb nanowire quantum dot. Proposed method does not require application of any (oscillating or static) external magnetic fields. Our proposal instead employs spatial and time modulation of confining potential induced by electric gates, which, in turn leads to oscillating Rashba type spin-orbit coupling. Moving electron back and forth in such a variable Rashba field allows for realization of spin rotations around two different axes separately without using an external magnetic field. The results are supported by realistic three-dimensional time dependent Poisson-Schroedinger calculations for systems and material parameters corresponding to experimentally accessible structures.

abstract: In this work we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a single correlated layer attached to two metallic leads, with particular focus on the low-energy physics. A steady state current is driven across the layer by applying a bias voltage between the leads. Extending previous work we introduce a nonzero temperature in the leads, which enables us to study the influence of quasiparticle excitations on the transport characteristics in detail. Even though the system is clearly three dimensional we obtain current-voltage curves that closely resemble those of single quantum dots. Furthermore, a splitting of the quasiparticle excitation with bias voltage is observed in the spectral function.

abstract: We have fabricated a wide-bandwidth, high dynamic range, low-noise cryogenic amplifier based on a superconducting kinetic inductance traveling-wave device. The device was made from NbTiN and consisted of a long, coplanar waveguide on a silicon chip. By adding a DC current and an RF pump tone we are able to generate parametric amplification using three-wave mixing. The devices exhibit gain of more than 15 dB across an instantaneous bandwidth from 4 to 8 GHz. The total usable gain bandwidth, including both sides of the signal-idler gain region, is more than 6 GHz. The noise referred to the input of the devices approaches the quantum limit, with less than 1 photon excess noise. Compared to similarly constructed four-wave mixing amplifiers, these devices operate with the RF pump at $\sim$20 dB lower power and at frequencies far from the signal. This will permit easier integration into large scale qubit and detector applications.

abstract: We adapt the horizon wave-function formalism to describe massive static spherically symmetric sources in a general $(1+D)$-dimensional space-time, for $D>3$ and including the $D=1$ case. We find that the probability $P_{\rm BH} $ that such objects are (quantum) black holes behaves similarly to the probability in the $(3+1)$ framework for $D> 3$. In fact, for $D\ge 3$, the probability increases towards unity as the mass grows above the relevant $D$-dimensional Planck scale $m_D$, the faster the larger $D$. In contrast, for $D=1$, we find the probability is comparably larger for smaller masses, but $P_{\rm BH} < 0.5$, suggesting that such lower dimensional black holes are purely quantum and not classical objects. This result is consistent with recent observations that sub-Planckian black holes are governed by an effective two-dimensional gravitation theory. Lastly, we derive Generalised Uncertainty Principle relations for the black holes under consideration, and for all cases find a minimum length scale $L_D$ corresponding to a characteristic energy scale $M_D\sim m_D$.
