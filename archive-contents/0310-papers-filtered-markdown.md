**1.    Two examples of discrete-time quantum walks taking continuous steps**  
Alex D. Gottlieb  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310026  
<blockquote>
<p>
This note introduces some examples of quantum random walks in d-dimensional Eucilidean space and proves the weak convergence of their rescaled n-step densities. One of the examples is called the Plancherel quantum walk because the "quantum coin flip" is the Fourier Integral (or Plancherel) Transform. The other examples are the Birkhoff quantum walks, so named because the coin flips are effected by means of measure preserving transformations to which the Birkhoff's Ergodic Theorem is applied.

**2.    The Minimum Distance Problem for Two-Way Entanglement Purification**  
Andris Ambainis, Daniel Gottesman  
IEEE Trans. Info. Theory vol. 52, issue 2, 748-753 (2006)

<blockquote>
<p>
Entanglement purification takes a number of noisy EPR pairs and processes them to produce a smaller number of more reliable pairs. If this is done with only a forward classical side channel, the procedure is equivalent to using a quantum error-correcting code (QECC). We instead investigate entanglement purification protocols with two-way classical side channels (2-EPPs) for finite block sizes. In particular, we consider the analog of the minimum distance problem for QECCs, and show that 2-EPPs can exceed the quantum Hamming bound and the quantum Singleton bound. We also show that 2-EPPs can achieve the rate k/n = 1 - (t/n) \log_2 3 - h(t/n) - O(1/n) (asymptotically reaching the quantum Hamming bound), where the EPP produces at least k good pairs out of n total pairs with up to t arbitrary errors, and h(x) = -x \log_2 x - (1-x) \log_2 (1-x) is the usual binary entropy. In contrast, the best known lower bound on the rate of QECCs is the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound k/n \geq 1 - (2t/n) \log_2 3 - h(2t/n). Indeed, in some regimes, the known upper bound on the asymptotic rate of good QECCs is strictly below our lower bound on the achievable rate of 2-EPPs.

**3.    Quantum Algorithms for the Triangle Problem**  
Frederic Magniez, Miklos Santha, Mario Szegedy  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310134  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present two new quantum algorithms that either find a triangle (a copy of $K_{3}$) in an undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes, or reject if $G$ is triangle free. The first algorithm uses combinatorial ideas with Grover Search and makes $\tilde{O}(n^{10/7})$ queries. The second algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n^{13/10})$ queries, and it is based on a design concept of Ambainis~\cite{amb04} that incorporates the benefits of quantum walks into Grover search~\cite{gro96}. The first algorithm uses only $O(\log n)$ qubits in its quantum subroutines, whereas the second one uses O(n) qubits. The Triangle Problem was first treated in~\cite{bdhhmsw01}, where an algorithm with $O(n+\sqrt{nm})$ query complexity was presented, where $m$ is the number of edges of $G$.

**4.    Quantum random walk on the line as a markovian process**  
A. Romanelli, A.C. Sicardi-Schifino, R. Siri, G. Abal, A. Auyuanet, R. Donangelo  
Physica A Volume/Issue338/3-4 pp. 395-405 (2004).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310171  
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyze in detail the discrete--time quantum walk on the line by separating the quantum evolution equation into Markovian and interference terms. As a result of this separation, it is possible to show analytically that the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker's position with time is a direct consequence of the coherence of the quantum evolution. If the evolution is decoherent, as in the classical case, the variance is shown to increase linearly with time, as expected. Furthermore we show that this system has an evolution operator analogous to that of a resonant quantum kicked rotor. As this rotator may be described through a quantum computational algorithm, one may employ this algorithm to describe the time evolution of the quantum walker.

**5.    Limit theorems and absorption problems for one-dimensional correlated random walks**  
Norio Konno  
Stochastic Models, Vol.25, Issue 1, pp.28-49 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0310191  
<blockquote>
<p>
There has recently been considerable interest in quantum walks in connection with quantum computing. The walk can be considered as a quantum version of the so-called correlated random walk. We clarify a strong structural similarity between both walks and study limit theorems and absorption problems for correlated random walks by our PQRS method, which was used in our analysis of quantum walks.
