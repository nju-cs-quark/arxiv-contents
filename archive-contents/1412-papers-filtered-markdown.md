**1.    Perfect quantum state transfer of hard-core bosons on weighted path graphs**  
Steven J. Large, Michael S. Underwood, David L. Feder

<blockquote>
<p>
The ability to accurately transfer quantum information through networks is an important primitive in distributed quantum systems. While perfect quantum state transfer (PST) can be effected by a single particle undergoing continuous-time quantum walks on a variety of graphs, it is not known if PST persists for many particles in the presence of interactions. We show that if single-particle PST occurs on one-dimensional weighted path graphs, then systems of hard-core bosons undergoing quantum walks on these paths also undergo PST. The analysis extends the Tonks-Girardeau ansatz to weighted graphs using techniques in algebraic graph theory. The results suggest that hard-core bosons do not generically undergo PST, even on graphs which exhibit single-particle PST.

**2.    Investigating graph isomorphism in cospectral graphs via multiparticle quantum walk in fermionic basis and entanglement entropy**  
M. A. Jafarizadeh, F. Eghbalifam, S. Nami  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1329  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the graph isomorphism (GI) in some cospectral networks. Two graph are isomorphic when they are related to each other by a relabeling of the graph vertices. We want to investigate the GI in two scalable (n + 2)-regular graphs G4(n; n + 2) and G5(n; n + 2), analytically by using the multiparticle quantum walk. These two graphs are a pair of non-isomorphic connected cospectral regular graphs for any positive integer n. In order to investigation GI in these two graphs, we rewrite the adjacency matrices of graphs in the antisymmetric fermionic basis and show that they are different for thesepairs of graphs. So the multiparticle quantum walk is able to distinguish pairs of non- isomorph graphs. Also we construct two new graphs T4(n; n + 2) and T5(n; n + 2) and repeat the same process of G4 and G5 to study the GI problem by using multiparticle quantum walk. Then we study GI by using the entanglement entropy. To this aim, we calculate entanglement entropy between two parts of network. In our model the nodes are considered as identical quantum harmonic oscillators. The entanglement entropy between two special parts of G4(n; n+2) and G5(n; n+2) are calculated analytically. It is shown that the entanglement entropy can distinguish pairs of non-isomorphic cospectral graphs too.

**3.    Experimental realization of a single qubit SIC POVM on via a one-dimensional photonic quantum walk**  
Zhihao Bian, Jian Li, Hao Qin, Xiang Zhan, Peng Xue  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2355  
<blockquote>
<p>
Symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measurement (SIC-POVM) is one important class of quantum measurement which is crucial for various quantum information processing tasks. SIC-POVMs have the advantage of providing an unbiased estimator for quantum states with the minimal number of outcomes needed for full tomography. We present an experimental approach on a photonic quantum walk which can be used to implement SIC-POVMs on a single-qbubit. The projection measurements of single-photons' positions correspond to elements of SIC-POVM on the polarization of single-photons.

**4.    Quaternionic quantum walks**  
Norio Konno  
Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp.63-76 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3264  
<blockquote>
<p>
The discrete-time quantum walk (QW) has been extensively and intensively investigated for the last decade, whose coin operator is defined by a unitary matrix. We extend the QW to a walk determined by a unitary matrix whose component is quaternion. We call this model quaternionic quantum walk (QQW) and present some properties. This paper is the first step for the study on QQWs.

**5.    Landau levels for discrete-time quantum walks in artificial magnetic fields**  
Pablo Arnault, Fabrice Debbasch  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4337  
<blockquote>
<p>
A new family of 2D discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) is presented and shown to coincide, in the continuous limit, with the Dirac dynamics of a spin 1/2 fermion coupled to a constant and homogeneous magnetic field. Landau levels are constructed, not only in the continuous limit, but also for the DTQWs i.e. for finite non-vanishing values of the time- and position-steps. All results are supported by numerical simulations. The possibility of quantum simulation of condensed matter systems by DTQWs is also discussed.

**6.    Simulating Hamiltonian dynamics with a truncated Taylor series**  
Dominic W. Berry, Andrew M. Childs, Richard Cleve, Robin Kothari, Rolando D. Somma  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 090502 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4687  
<blockquote>
<p>
We describe a simple, efficient method for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics on a quantum computer by approximating the truncated Taylor series of the evolution operator. Our method can simulate the time evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. As in another recent algorithm, the cost of our method depends only logarithmically on the inverse of the desired precision, which is optimal. However, we simplify the algorithm and its analysis by using a method for implementing linear combinations of unitary operations to directly apply the truncated Taylor series.

**7.    Central limit theorem for reducible and irreducible open quantum walks**  
Przemys?aw Sadowski, ?ukasz Pawela  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5086  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this work we aim at proving central limit theorems for open quantum walks on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We study the case when there are various classes of vertices in the network. Furthermore, we investigate two ways of distributing the vertex classes in the network. First we assign the classes in a regular pattern. Secondly, we assign each vertex a random class with a uniform distribution. For each way of distributing vertex classes, we obtain an appropriate central limit theorem, illustrated by numerical examples. These theorems may have application in the study of complex systems in quantum biology and dissipative quantum computation.

**8.    Storage of hyperentanglement in a solid-state quantum memory**

Optica, 2, 279--287 (2015)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6488  
<blockquote>
<p>
Two photons can simultaneously share entanglement between several degrees of freedom such as polarization, energy-time, spatial mode and orbital angular momentum. This resource is known as hyperentanglement, and it has been shown to be an important tool for optical quantum information processing. Here we demonstrate the quantum storage and retrieval of photonic hyperentanglement in a solid-state quantum memory. A pair of photons entangled in polarization and energy-time is generated such that one photon is stored in the quantum memory, while the other photon has a telecommunication wavelength suitable for transmission in optical fibre. We measured violations of a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality for each degree of freedom, independently of the other one, which proves the successful storage and retrieval of the two bits of entanglement shared by the photons. Our scheme is compatible with long-distance quantum communication in optical fibre, and is in particular suitable for linear-optical entanglement purification for quantum repeaters.

**9.    The space "just above" BQP**  
Scott Aaronson, Adam Bouland, Joseph Fitzsimons, Mitchell Lee  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6507  
<blockquote>
<p>
We explore the space "just above" BQP by defining a complexity class PDQP (Product Dynamical Quantum Polynomial time) which is larger than BQP but does not contain NP relative to an oracle. The class is defined by imagining that quantum computers can perform measurements that do not collapse the wavefunction. This (non-physical) model of computation can efficiently solve problems such as Graph Isomorphism and Approximate Shortest Vector which are believed to be intractable for quantum computers. Furthermore, it can search an unstructured N-element list in $\tilde O$(N^{1/3}) time, but no faster than {\Omega}(N^{1/4}), and hence cannot solve NP-hard problems in a black box manner. In short, this model of computation is more powerful than standard quantum computation, but only slightly so. Our work is inspired by previous work of Aaronson on the power of sampling the histories of hidden variables. However Aaronson's work contains an error in its proof of the lower bound for search, and hence it is unclear whether or not his model allows for search in logarithmic time. Our work can be viewed as a conceptual simplification of Aaronson's approach, with a provable polynomial lower bound for search.

**10.    Symmetries and self-similarity of many-body wavefunctions**  
Piotr Migda?  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6796  
<blockquote>
<p>
This PhD thesis is dedicated to the study of the interplay between symmetries of quantum states and their self-similar properties. It consists of three connected threads of research: polynomial invariants for multiphoton states, visualization schemes for quantum many-body systems and a complex networks approach to quantum walks on a graph. First, we study the problem of which many-photon states are equivalent up to the action of passive linear optics. We prove that it can be converted into the problem of equivalence of two permutation-symmetric states, not necessarily restricted to the same operation on all parties. We show that the problem can be formulated in terms of symmetries of complex polynomials of many variables, and provide two families of invariants, which are straightforward to compute and provide analytical results. Second, we study a family of recursive visualization schemes for many-particle systems, for which we have coined the name 'qubism'. While all many-qudit states can be plotted with qubism, it is especially useful for spin chains and one-dimensional translationally invariant states. This symmetry results in self-similarity of the plot, making it more comprehensible and allowing to discover certain structures. Third, we study quantum walks of a single particle on graphs, which are classical analogues of random walks. Our focus is on the long-time limit of the probability distribution and we study how (especially in the long-time limit) off-diagonal elements of the density matrix behave. We use them to perform quantum community detection - splitting of a graph into subgraphs in such a way that the coherence between them is small. Our method captures properties that classical methods cannot - the impact of constructive and destructive interference, as well as the dependence of the results on the tunneling phase.

**11.    One dimensional lazy quantum walks and occupancy rate**  
Dan Li, Michael Mc Gettrick, Wei-Wei Zhang, Ke-Jia Zhang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6891  
<blockquote>
<p>
Lazy quantum walks were presented by Andrew M. Childs to prove that the continuous-time quantum walk is a limit of the discrete-time quantum walk [Commun.Math.Phys.294,581-603(2010)]. In this paper, we discuss properties of lazy quantum walks. Our analysis shows that lazy quantum walks have $O(t^n)$ order of the n-th moment of the corresponding probability distribution, which is the same as that for normal quantum walks. Also, the lazy quantum walk with DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) coin operator has a similar probability distribution concentrated interval to that of the normal Hadamard quantum walk. Most importantly, we introduce the concepts of occupancy number and occupancy rate to measure the extent to which the walk has a (relatively) high probability at every position in its range. We conclude that lazy quantum walks have a higher occupancy rate than other walks such as normal quantum walks, classical walks and lazy classical walks.

**12.    Systematic Dimensionality Reduction for Quantum Walks: Optimal Spatial Search and Transport on Non-Regular Graphs**  
Leonardo Novo, Shantanav Chakraborty, Masoud Mohseni, Hartmut Neven, Yasser Omar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7209  
<blockquote>
<p>
Continuous time quantum walks provide an important framework for designing new algorithms and modelling quantum transport and state transfer problems. Often, the graph representing the structure of a problem contains certain symmetries which confine the dynamics to a smaller subspace of the full Hilbert space. In this work, we use a systematic method to compute the reduced set of states that encompass the dynamics of the problem at hand without the specific knowledge of underlying symmetries. First, we apply this method to obtain new instances of graphs where the spatial quantum search algorithm is optimal: complete graphs with broken links and complete bipartite graphs. These examples show that regularity and high-connectivity are not needed to achieve optimal spatial search. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time optimal quantum search on a planar structure, namely the star graph. We also show that this method considerably simplifies the calculation of quantum transport efficiencies. Furthermore, we observe improved efficiencies by removing a few links from highly symmetric graphs. Finally, we show that this reduction method also allows us to obtain an upper bound for the fidelity of a single qubit transfer on an XY spin network.

**13.    Asymptotic analysis of the one-dimensional quantum walks by the Tsallis and R��nyi entropies**  
Yusuke Ide, Norio Konno, Junji Shikata  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7338  
<blockquote>
<p>
The Tsallis and R\'enyi entropies are important quantities in the information theory, statistics and related fields because the Tsallis entropy is an one parameter generalization of the Shannon entropy and the R\'enyi entropy includes several useful entropy measures such as the Shannon entropy, Min-entropy and so on, as special choices of its parameter. On the other hand, the discrete-time quantum walk plays important roles in various applications, for example, quantum speed-up algorithm and universal computation. In this paper, we show limiting behaviors of the Tsallis and R\'enyi entropies for discrete-time quantum walks on the line which are starting from the origin and defined by arbitrary coin and initial state. The results show that the Tsallis entropy behaves in polynomial order of time with the parameter dependent exponent while the R\'enyi entropy tends to infinity in logarithmic order of time independent of the choice of the parameter. Moreover, we show the difference between the R\'enyi entropy and the logarithmic function characterizes by the R\'enyi entropy of the limit distribution of the quantum walk. In addition, we show an example of asymptotic behavior of the conditional R\'enyi entropies of the quantum walk.

**14.    Search Via quantum walks with intermediate measurements**  
Efrain Buksman, Andr�� L. Fonseca de Oliveira, Jes��s Garc?a L��pez de Lacalle  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7453  
<blockquote>
<p>
A modification of the Tulsi quantum search algorithm with intermediate measurements of the control is presented. In order to analyze the effect of measurements in quantum searches, a different choice of the angular parameter is used. The study is performed for several values of time lapses between measurements, finding close relationships between probabilities and correlations (Mutual Information and Cumulative Correlation Measure). The order of this modified algorithm is estimated, showing that for some time lapses the performance is improved, and became of order $O(N)$ (classical brute force search) when the measurement is taken in every step. The results indicate a possible way to analyze improvements to other quantum algorithms using one, or more, control qubits.

**15.    Two-dimensional macroscopic quantum tunneling in multi-gap superconductor Josephson junctions**  
Hidehiro Asai, Shiro Kawabata, Yukihiro Ota, Masahiko Machida  
J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. 568 022006 (2014)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5276  
<blockquote>
<p>
Low-temperature characters of superconducting devices yield definite probes for different superconducting phenomena. We study the macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) in a Josephson junction, composed of a single-gap superconductor and a two-gap superconductor. Since this junction has two kinds to the superconducting phase differences, calculating the MQT escape rate requires the analysis of quantum tunneling in a multi-dimensional configuration space. Our approach is the semi-classical approximation along a 1D curve in a 2D potential- energy landscape, connecting two adjacent potential (local) minimums through a saddle point. We find that this system has two plausible tunneling paths; an in-phase path and an out-of-phase path. The former is characterized by the Josephson-plasma frequency, whereas the latter is by the frequency of the characteristic collective mode in a two-band superconductor, Josephson- Leggett mode. Depending on external bias current and inter-band Josephson-coupling energy, one of them mainly contributes to the MQT. Our numerical calculations show that the difference between the in-phase path and the out-of-phase path is manifest, with respect to the bias- current-dependence of the MQT escape rate. This result suggests that our MQT setting be an indicator of the Josephson-Leggett mode.
