abstract: We discuss methods to analyze a quantum Gibbs family in the ultra-cold regime where the norm closure of the Gibbs family fails due to discontinuities of the maximum-entropy inference. The current discussion of maximum-entropy inference and irreducible correlation in the area of quantum phase transitions is a major motivation for this research. We extend a representation of the irreducible correlation from finite temperatures to absolute zero.

abstract: We show that the well-established \v{C}erenkov Effect contains new phenomena arising directly from the quantum nature of the charged particles. These include large deviations from the classically-expected radiation intensity and angle. Most importantly, we find that the traditional Cerenkov angle splits, confining the emitted radiation into two distinctive cones into which two photonic shock waves are emitted. Interestingly, one of the two shockwaves can move on a backward cone, which is otherwise considered impossible for \v{C}erenkov Radiaiton in ordinary materials. Moreover, for specific values of the particle momentum, we predict an upper frequency cutoff in the photon emission. Surprisingly, for this extremum frequency we find a diverging rate of photon emission, implying this is a new resonant light-matter interaction. Some of these new effects cannot be found without the full quantum derivation. Importantly, our findings are observable for electron beams with realistic parameters, offering new applications including coherent x-ray sources and open a new realm for \v{C}erenkov detectors.

abstract: Quantum $n$-body correlations violate inequalities for nonlocal theories in which arbitrary correlations are allowed within any strict subset of bodies while only local correlations are allowed between the subsets. Violations of these inequalities have been recently observed up to $n=6$. An important question is why the universe is exactly as genuinely $n$-body nonlocal as predicted by quantum theory, but not more or less. Here we prove that, for any $n>2$, the exclusivity principle and two assumptions (namely, independence of remote experiments and existence of a joint probability distribution for certain measurements), give, for general probabilistic theories, the same genuinely $n$-body nonlocality found in quantum theory.

abstract: We theoretically study operations with a four-level superconducting circuit as a two-qubit system. Using a mapping on a two-qubit system, we show how to implement iSWAP gates and Hadamard gates through pulses on transitions between particular pairs of energy levels. Our approach allows one to prepare pure two-qubit entangled states with desired form of reduced density matrices of the same purity and, in particular, arbitrary identical reduced states of qubits. We propose using schemes for the Hadamard gate and two-qubit entangled states with identical reduced density matrices in order to verify $\log{N}$ inequalities for Shannon and R\'enyi entropies for the considered noncomposite quantum system.

abstract: We propose and theoretically simulate an experiment for demonstrating a motional-state Bell inequality violation for pairs of momentum-entangled atoms produced in Bose-Einstein condensate collisions. The proposal is based on realizing an atom-optics analog of the Rarity-Tapster optical scheme: it uses laser-induced Bragg pulses to implement two-particle interferometry on the underlying Bell-state for two pairs of atomic scattering modes with equal but opposite momenta. The collision dynamics and the sequence of Bragg pulses are simulated using the stochastic Bogoliubov approach in the positive-P representation. We predict values of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) parameter up to S~2.5 for experimentally realistic parameter regimes, showing a strong violation of the CSHS-Bell inequality bounded classically by S<2.

This study renders the operator $P_{r}$ indirectly measurable and physically meaningful.

abstract: In this paper, a bidirectional quantum teleportation protocol based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs and entanglement swapping is proposed. In this scheme, two users can simultaneously transmit an unknown single-qubit state to each other. The implementation of the proposed scheme is easier in experiment as compared to previous work. By utilizing this bidirectional quantum teleportation protocol, a bidirectional quantum secure direct communication scheme without carrying secret message is presented. Therefore, in the case of using perfect quantum channel, the protocol is completely secure. Finally, security analyses are investigated.

abstract: In the present paper, a novel bidirectional quantum teleportation protocol is proposed. By using entanglement swapping technique, two GHZ states are shared as a quantum channel between Alice and Bob as legitimate users. In this scheme, based on control-not operation, single-qubit measurement and appropriate unitary operations, two users can simultaneously transmit a pure EPR state to each other. While, in the previous protocols, the users can just teleport a single-qubit state to each other via more than four-qubit state. Therefore, the proposed scheme is economical compared with previous protocols.

abstract: When a quantum state undergoes a quantum channel, the state will be inevitably influenced. In general, the fidelity of the state is reduced, so is the entanglement if the sub- systems go through the channel. However, the influence on the coherence of the state is quite different. Here we present some state-independent quantities to describe to what degree the fidelity, the entanglement and the coherence of the state are influenced. As applications, we consider some quantum channels on a qubit and find that the infidelity ability monotonically depends on the decay rate, but in usual the decoherence ability is not the case and strongly depends on the channel.

abstract: We present the dipole induced transparency (DIT) of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center embedded in a photonic crystal cavity coupled to two waveguides, and it is obvious with the robust and flexible reflectance and transmittance difference of circularly polarized lights between the uncoupled and the coupled cavities even in the bad cavity regime (the Purcell regime). With this DIT, we propose two universal hyperparallel hybrid photonic quantum logic gates, including a hybrid hyper-controlled-not gate and a hybrid hyper-Toffoli gate, on photon systems in both the polarization and the spatial-mode degrees of freedom (DOFs), which are equal to two identical quantum logic gates operating simultaneously on the systems in one DOF. They can be used to perform more quantum operations with less resources in the quantum information protocols with multi-qubit systems in several DOFs, which may depress the resources consumed and the photonic dissipation. Moreover, they are more robust against asymmetric environment noise in the weak-coupling regime, compared with the integration of two cascaded quantum logic gates in one DOF.

abstract: We investigate the hypercube networks that their nodes are considered as quantum harmonic oscillators. The entanglement of the ground state can be used to quantify the amount of information each part of a network shares with the rest of the system via quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the Schmidt numbers and entanglement entropy between two special parts of Hypercube network, can be calculated. To this aim, first we use the stratification method to rewrite the adjacency matrix of the network in the stratification basis which is the matrix representation of the angular momentum. Then the entanglement entropy and Schmidt number for special partitions are calculated an- alytically by using the generalized Schur complement method. Also, we calculate the entanglement entropy between two arbitrary equal subsets (two equal subsets have the same number of vertices) in H(3, 2) and H(4, 2) numerically, and we give the minimum and maximum values of entanglement entropy in these two Hypercube network. Then we can conjecture the minimum and maximum values of entanglement entropy for equal subsets in H(d, 2).

Specifically, given a set of non-commuting Hamiltonians {h1, . . ., hm} operating on a d-dimensional quantum system Hd, the problem consists in identifying a set of commuting Hamiltonians {H1,...,Hm} operating on a larger dE-dimensional system H_{dE} which embeds H_d as a proper subspace, such that hj = PHjP with P being the projection which allows one to recover Hd from HdE . The notions of spanning-set purification and generator purification of an algebra are also introduced and optimal solutions for u(d) are provided.

Invariance with respect to reference frame transformations of the results in different models is discussed. Surprisingly, the bare results of noninvasive measurements are invariant for certain class of models, but not the detection error. Consequently, any stationary quantum realism based on noninvasive measurements will break, at least spontaneously, relativistic invariance and correspondence principle at zero temperature.

abstract: We study the operational regime of a noiseless linear amplifier based on quantum scissors that can nondeterministically amplify the one photon component of a quantum state with weak excitation. It has been shown that an arbitrarily large quantum state can be amplified by first splitting it into weak excitation states using a network of beamsplitters. The output states of the network can then be coherently recombined. In this paper, we analyse the performance of such a device for distilling entanglement after transmission through a lossy quantum channel, and look at two measures to determine the efficacy of the noiseless linear amplifier. The measures used are the amount of entanglement achievable and the final purity of the output amplified entangled state. We study the performances of both a single and a two-element noiseless linear amplifier for amplifying weakly excited states. Practically, we show that it may be advantageous to work with a limited number of stages.

abstract: We show that by averaging over transitions to multiple hyperfine levels, quadrupole shifts and dominant Zeeman effects exactly cancel whenever the nuclear spin, I, is at least as large as the total electronic angular momentum, J. The average frequency thus defines a frequency reference which is inherently independent of external magnetic fields and electric field gradients. We use Lu+ to illustrate the method although the approach could be readily adapted to other atomic species. This approach practically eliminates the quadrupole and Zeeman shift considerations for many clock candidates.

abstract: We propose an environment recycling scheme to speed up a class of tensor network algorithms that produce an approximation to the ground state of a local Hamiltonian by simulating an evolution in imaginary time. Specifically, we consider the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm applied to infinite systems in 1D and 2D, where the ground state is encoded, respectively, in a matrix product state (MPS) and in a projected entangled-pair state (PEPS). An important ingredient of the TEBD algorithm (and a main computational bottleneck, especially with PEPS in 2D) is the computation of the so-called environment, which is used to determine how to optimally truncate the bond indices of the tensor network so that their dimension is kept constant. In current algorithms, the environment is computed at each step of the imaginary time evolution, to account for the changes that the time evolution introduces in the many-body state represented by the tensor network. Our key insight is that close to convergence, most of the changes in the environment are due to a change in the choice of gauge in the bond indices of the tensor network, and not in the many-body state. Indeed, a consistent choice of gauge in the bond indices confirms that the environment is essentially the same over many time steps and can thus be re-used, leading to very substantial computational savings. We demonstrate the resulting approach in 1D and 2D by computing the ground state of the quantum Ising model in a transverse magnetic field.

abstract: We introduce and study the notion of steerability for channels. This generalizes the notion of steerability of bipartite quantum states. We discuss a key conceptual difference between the case of states and the case of channels: while state steering deals with the notion of "hidden" states, steerability in the channel case is better understood in terms of coherence of channel extensions, rather than in terms of "hidden" channels. This distinction vanishes in the case of states. We further argue how the proposed notion of lack of coherence of channel extensions coincides with the notion of channel extensions realized via local operations and classical communication. We also discuss how the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism allows the direct application of many results about states to the case of channels. We introduce measures for the steerability of channel extensions.

abstract: Single excitons in semiconductor microcavities represent a solid-state and scalable platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics (c-QED), potentially enabling an interface between flying (photon) and static (exciton) quantum bits in future quantum networks. While both single-photon emission and the strong coupling regime have been demonstrated, further progress has been hampered by the inability to control the coherent evolution of the c-QED system in real time, as needed to produce and harness charge-photon entanglement. Here, using the ultrafast electrical tuning of the exciton energy in a photonic crystal (PhC) diode, we demonstrate the dynamic control of the coupling of a single exciton to a PhC cavity mode on a sub-ns timescale, faster than the natural lifetime of the exciton, for the first time. This opens the way to the control of single-photon waveforms, as needed for quantum interfaces, and to the real-time control of solid-state c-QED systems.

abstract: It is a topic of fundamental and practical importance how a quantum correlated state can be reliably distributed through a noisy channel for quantum information processing. The concept of quantum steering recently defined in a rigorous manner is relevant to study it under certain circumstances and we here address quantum steerability of Gaussian states to this aim. In particular, we attempt to reformulate the criterion for Gaussian steering in terms of local and global purities and show that it is sufficient and necessary for the case of steering a 1-mode system by a $N$-mode system. It subsequently enables us to reinforce a strong monogamy relation under which only one party can steer a local system of 1-mode. Moreover, we show that only a negative partial-transpose state can manifest quantum steerability by Gaussian measurements in relation to the Peres conjecture. We also discuss our formulation for the case of distributing a two-mode squeezed state via one-way quantum channels making dissipation and amplification effects, respectively. Finally, we extend our approach to include non-Gaussian measurements, more precisely, all orders of higher-order squeezing measurements, and find that this broad set of non-Gaussian measurements is not useful to demonstrate steering for Gaussian states beyond Gaussian measurements.

abstract: Steering is a manifestation of quantum correlations that embodies the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. While there have been recent attempts to quantify steering, continuous variable systems remained elusive. We introduce a steering measure for two-mode continuous variable systems that is valid for arbitrary states. The measure is based on the violation of an optimized variance test for the EPR paradox, and admits a computable and experimentally friendly lower bound only depending on the second moments of the state, which reduces to a recently proposed quantifier of steerability by Gaussian measurements. We further show that Gaussian states are extremal with respect to our measure, minimizing it among all continuous variable states with fixed second moments. As a byproduct of our analysis, we generalize and relate well-known EPR-steering criteria. Finally an operational interpretation is provided, as the proposed measure is shown to quantify the optimal guaranteed key rate in semi-device independent quantum key distribution.

An absence of detected motion would be contrary to the prediction of Orthodox Quantum Theory and would support the deBroglie-Bohm Theory.

abstract: We investigate the characteristics of entanglement teleportation of a two-qubit Heisenberg XYZ model under different Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction with intrinsic decoherence taken into account. The comparison of the two different Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the effects of the initial state and the inputting state on the entanglement teleportation are presented. The results reveal that the dynamics of entanglement is a symmetry function about for the system, whereas it is not for the system. The ferromagnetic case is superior to the antiferromagnetic case for restrain decoherence when using the system. The dependence of entanglement, output entanglement, fidelity on initial state angle all demonstrate periodic. Moreover, we find that seemingly some system are not suitable for teleportation, but they can acquire some best exhibition if we take the proper initial state and inputting state.

abstract: The expected return time to the original state is a key concept characterizing systems obeying both classical or quantum dynamics. We consider iterated open quantum dynamical systems in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, a broad class of systems that includes classical Markov chains and unitary discrete time quantum walks on networks. Starting from a pure state, the time evolution is induced by repeated applications of a general quantum channel, in each timestep followed by a measurement to detect whether the system has returned to the original state. We prove that if the superoperator is unital in the relevant Hilbert space (the part of the Hilbert space explored by the system), then the expectation value of the return time is an integer, equal to the dimension of this relevant Hilbert space. We illustrate our results on partially coherent quantum walks on finite graphs. Our work connects the previously known quantization of the expected return time for bistochastic Markov chains and for unitary quantum walks, and shows that these are special cases of a more general statement. The expected return time is thus a quantitative measure of the size of the part of the Hilbert space available to the system when the dynamics is started from a certain state.

Here we show that the tradeoff is switched on or off by the quantum uncertainties of two involved non-commuting observables: if one is more certain than the other, there is no tradeoff; otherwise, they do have tradeoff and the Jensen-Shannon divergence gives it a good characterization.

abstract: Theoretical analysis of a suspended nano-mechanical membrane subject to an optical driving field in cavity optomechanics is presented, which is confirmed through numerical simulations. In the presence of an optical field between its mirrors a high finesse nano-mechanical resonator acts as an oscillator driven by radiation pressure force. The periodic nature of the radiation pressure force makes the nano-mechanical membrane in the optomechanical system as kicked harmonic oscillator. Mathematically the physical system displays a stochastic web map that helps to understand several properties of the kicked membrane in classical phase space. We find that our web map is area preserving, and displays quasi-periodic symmetrical structures in phase space which we express as q-fold symmetry. It is shown that under appropriate control of certain parameters, namely the frequency ratio (q) and the kicking strength (K), the dynamics of kicked membrane exhibits chaotic dynamics. We provide the stability analysis by means of Lyapunov exponent and survival probability.

abstract: Under ideal conditions, quantum metrology promises a precision gain over classical techniques scaling quadratically with the number of probe particles. At the same time, no-go results have shown that generic, uncorrelated noise limits the quantum advantage to a constant factor. In frequency estimation scenarios, however, there are exceptions to this rule and, in particular, it has been found that transversal dephasing does allow for a scaling quantum advantage. Yet, it has remained unclear whether such exemptions can be exploited in practical scenarios. Here, we argue that the transversal-noise model applies to the setting of recent magnetometry experiments, and show that a scaling advantage can be maintained with one-axis-twisted spin-squeezed states and Ramsey-interferometry-like measurements. This is achieved by exploiting the geometry of the setup that, as we demonstrate, has a strong influence on the achievable quantum enhancement for experimentally feasible parameter settings. When, in addition to the dominant transversal noise, other sources of decoherence are present, the quantum advantage is asymptotically bounded by a constant, but this constant may be significantly improved by exploring the geometry.

abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of generating arbitrary three-party correlations from a combination of public and secret correlations. Two parties -- called Alice and Bob -- share perfectly correlated bits that are secret from a collaborating third party, Charlie. At the same time, all three parties have access to a separate source of correlated bits, and their goal is to convert these two resources into multiple copies of some given tripartite distribution $P_{XYZ}$. We obtain a single-letter characterization of the trade-off between public and private bits that are needed to achieve this task. The rate of private bits is shown to generalize Wyner's classic notion of common information held between a pair of random variables. The problem we consider is also closely related to the task of secrecy formation in which $P_{XYZ}$ is generated using public communication and local randomness but with Charlie functioning as an adversary instead of a collaborator. We describe in detail the differences between the collaborative and adversarial scenarios.

abstract: Scattering theory methods make it possible to calculate the Casimir energy of a perfectly conducting elliptic cylinder opposite a perfectly conducting plane in terms of Mathieu functions. In the limit of zero radius, the elliptic cylinder becomes a finite-width strip, which allows for the study of edge effects. However, existing packages for computing Mathieu functions are insufficient for this calculation, because none can compute Mathieu functions of both the first and second kind for complex arguments. To address this shortcoming, we have written a general purpose Mathieu function package, based on algorithms developed by Alhargan [1,2]. We use these routines to find edge corrections to the proximity force approximation for the Casimir energy of a perfectly conducting strip opposite a perfectly conducting plane.

abstract: Coupling individual quantum systems lies at the heart of building scalable quantum networks. Here, we report the first direct photonic coupling between a semiconductor quantum dot and a trapped ion and we demonstrate that single photons generated by a quantum dot controllably change the internal state of an $\textrm{Yb}^+$ ion. We ameliorate the effect of the sixty-fold mismatch of the radiative linewidths with coherent photon generation and a high-finesse fiber-based optical cavity enhancing the coupling between the single photon and the ion. The transfer of information presented here via the classical correlations between the $\sigma_z$-projection of the quantum-dot spin and the internal state of the ion provides a promising step towards quantum state-transfer in a hybrid photonic network.

abstract: Photon loss is one of the main obstacles in current long-distance quantum communications. The approach of noiseless linear amplification (NLA) is one of the powerful way to distill the single-photon state (SPS) from a mixed state, which comprises both the SPS and vacuum state. However, existing NLA protocol can only perform the amplification for one time. That is the fidelity of the SPS cannot be increased anymore. In this paper, We put forward an efficient cascaded NLA protocol for both the SPS and single-photon entanglement (SPE), respectively, with the help of some auxiliary single photons. By repeating this protocol for sever times, the fidelity of the SPS and SPE can reach near 100\%, which may make this protocol is extremely useful to close the detection loophole in quantum key distribution. Moreover, this protocol is based on the linear optics, which makes it feasible in current technology.

abstract: We propose two efficient entanglement concentration protocols (ECPs) for arbitrary less-entangled single-photon entanglement (SPE). Different from all the previous ECPs, these protocols not only can obtain the maximally SPE, but also can protect the single qubit information encoded in the polarization degree of freedom. These protocols only require one pair of less-entangled single-photon entangled state and some auxiliary single photons, which makes them economical. The first ECP is operated with the linear optical elements, which can be realized in current experiment. The second ECP adopts the cross-Kerr nonlinearities. Moreover, the second ECP can be repeated to concentrate the discard states in some conventional ECPs, so that it can get a high success probability. Based on above properties, our ECPs may be useful in current and future quantum communication.

The efficiency of creating sifted key can reach 100\% in principle, which is higher than previous protocols. Especially, compared with the typical quantum key distribution, the present scheme does not require the authorized parties to check their bases. Because the potential eavesdropper can only access part of the quantum system, the proposed scheme has natural practical security advantages. The scheme can be implemented with current technologies and opens promising possibilities for quantum cryptography.

abstract: The gradient expansion of the kinetic energy functional, when applied for atoms or finite systems, usually grossly overestimates the energy in the fourth order and generally diverges in the sixth order. We avoid the divergence of the integral by replacing the asymptotic series including the sixth order term in the integrand by a rational function. Pade approximant s show moderate improvements in accuracy in comparison with partial sums of the series. The results are discussed for atoms and Hooke's law model for two-electron atoms.

abstract: The uncertainty relation between angle and orbital angular momentum had not been formulated in a similar form as the uncertainty relation between position and linear momentum because the angle variable is not represented by a quantum mechanical self-adjoint operator. Instead of the angle variable operator, we introduce the complex position operator $ \hat{Z} = \hat{x}+i \hat{y} $ and interpret the order parameter $ \mu = \langle \hat{Z} \rangle / \sqrt{ \langle \hat{Z}^\dagger \hat{Z} \rangle} $ as a measure of certainty of the angle distribution. We prove the relation between the uncertainty of angular momentum and the angle order parameter. We prove also its generalizations and discuss experimental methods for testing these relations.

abstract: The principle of local distinguishability states that an arbitrary physical state of a bipartite system can be determined by the combined statistics of local measurements performed on the subsystems. A necessary and sufficient requirement for the local measurements is that each one must be able to distinguish between all pairs of states of the respective subsystems. We show that if the task is changed into the determination of an arbitrary bipartite pure state, then at least in certain cases it is possible to restrict to local measurements which can distintinguish all pure states but not all states. This surprising fact gives evidence that the principle of local distinguishability may be expanded beyond its usual applicability.

The dynamics and spectral features are discussed with respect to the applicability for color centers, especially for negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.

abstract: A new quantum correlation in terms of the average distance between the reduced state and the $i$-th output reduced states under local von Neumann measurements is proposed. It is shown that only the product states do not contain this quantum correlation and thus it is different from both the quantum discord (QD) [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{88}, 017901 (2001)] and the measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN) [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{106}, 120401(2011)]. For pure states, it is twice of the quantity MIN, and is smaller than QD and entanglement of formation (EOF). A general analytical formula is given and a lower bound for the two qubits case is obtained. Furthermore, we compare it with EOF and QD through the Werner state and the isotropic state respectively.

Interesting byproducts of the proofs are a weighted analog of Klein's inequality and non-negativity of quantum weighted relative entropy. A main difficulty is the fact that the weights in general do not commute with the density matrices.

abstract: We model the transport of an unknown quantum state on one dimensional qubit lattices by means of a quantum cellular automata evolution. We do this by first introducing a class of discrete noisy dynamics, in the first excitation sector, in which a wide group of classical stochastic dynamics is embedded within the more general formalism of quantum operations. We then extend the Hilbert space of the system to accommodate a global vacuum state, thus allowing for the transport of initial on-site coherences besides excitations, and determine the dynamical constraints that define the class of noisy quantum cellular automata in this subspace. We then study the transport performance through numerical simulations, showing that for some instances of the dynamics perfect quantum state transfer is attainable. Our approach provides one with a natural description of both unitary and open quantum evolutions, where the homogeneity and locality of interactions allow one to take into account several forms of quantum noise in a plausible scenario.

abstract: We address the dynamics of nonclassicality for a quantum system interacting with a noisy fluctuating environment described by a classical stochastic field. As a paradigmatic example, we consider a harmonic oscillator initially prepared in a maximally nonclassical state, e.g. a Fock number state or a Schroedinger cat-like state, and then coupled to either resonant or non-resonant external field. Stochastic modeling allows us to describe the decoherence dynamics without resorting to approximated quantum master equations, and to introduce non- Markovian effects in a controlled way. A detailed comparison among different nonclassicality criteria and a thorough analysis of the decoherence time reveal a rich phenomenology whose main features may be summarized as follows: i) classical memory effects increase the survival time of quantum coherence; ii) a detuning between the natural frequency of the system and the central frequency of the classical field induces revivals of quantum coherence.

abstract: While dissipation is widely considered as being harmful for quantum coherence, it can, when properly engineered, lead to the stabilization of non-trivial pure quantum states. We propose a scheme for continuous generation and stabilization of Schr\"{o}dinger cat states in a cavity using dissipation engineering. We first generate non-classical photon states with definite parity by means of a two-photon drive and dissipation, and then stabilize these transient states against single-photon decay. The single-photon stabilization is autonomous, and is implemented through a second engineered bath, which exploits the photon number dependent frequency-splitting due to Kerr interactions in the strongly dispersive regime of circuit QED. Starting with the Hamiltonian of the baths plus cavity, we derive an effective model of only the cavity photon states along with analytic expressions for relevant physical quantities, such as the stabilization rate. The deterministic generation of such cat states is one of the key ingredients in performing universal quantum computation.

abstract: We propose a simple technique to generate entanglement between distant cavities by using entanglement swapping involving atomic momenta. For the proposed scheme, we have two identical atoms, both initially in their ground state, each incident on far apart cavities with particular initial momenta. The two cavities are prepared initially in superposition of zero and one photon state. First, we interact each atom with a cavity in dispersive way. The interaction results into atom-field entangled state. Then we perform EPR state measurement on both atomic momenta state which is an analog of Bell measurement. The EPR state measurement is designed by passing the atoms through cavity beam splitters which transfers the atomic momentum state into superposition state. Finally, these atoms are detected by the detector. After the detection of the atoms, we can distinguish that cavities in one of the Bell states. This process leads to two distant cavity fields entanglement.

abstract: The spin 1 particle is treated in the presence of the Dirac magnetic monopole in the Minkowski and Lobachevsky spaces. Separating the variables in the frame of the matrix 10-component Duffin-Kemer-Petiau approach (wave equation) and making a nonrelativistic approximation in the corresponding radial equations, a system of three coupled second order linear differential equations is derived for each type of geometry. For the Minkowski space, the nonrelativistic equations are disconnected using a linear transformation, which makes the mixing matrix diagonal. The resultant three unconnected equations involve three routs of a cubic algebraic equation as parameters. The approach allows extension to the case of additional external spherically symmetric fields. The Coulomb and oscillator potentials are considered and for each of these cases three series of energy spectra are derived. A special attention is given to the states with minimum value of the total angular momentum. In the case of the curved background of the Lobachevsky geometry, the mentioned linear transformation does not disconnect the nonrelativistic equations in the presence of the monopole. Nevertheless, we derive the solution of the problem in the case of minimum total angular momentum. In this case, we additionally involve a Coulomb or oscillator field. Finally, considering the case without the monopole field, we show that for both Coulomb and oscillator potentials the problem is reduced to a system of three differential equations involving a hypergeometric and two general Heun equations. Imposing on the parameters of the latter equations a specific requirement, reasonable from the physical standpoint, we derive the corresponding energy spectra.

abstract: High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) allows two parties to generate multiple secure bits of information per detected photon. In this work, we show that decoy state protocols can be practically implemented for HD-QKD using only one or two decoy states. HD-QKD with two decoy states, under realistic experimental constraints, can generate multiple secure bits per coincidence at distances over 200 km and at rates similar to those achieved by a protocol with infinite decoy states. Furthermore, HD-QKD with only one decoy state is practical at short distances, where it is almost as secure as a protocol with two decoy states. HD-QKD with only one or two decoy states can therefore be implemented to optimize the rate of secure quantum communications.

abstract: A large number of bound state properties of the four-body muonium-positronium system MuPs (or $\mu^{+} e^{-}_2 e^{+}$) are determined to high accuracy. Based on these expectation values we predict that the weakly-bound four-body MuPs system has the `two-body' cluster structure Mu + Ps. The two neutral clusters Mu ($\mu^{+} e^{-}$) and Ps ($e^{+} e^{-}$) interact with each other by the attractive van der Waals forces. By using our expectation values of the electron-positron delta-functions we evaluated the half-life $\tau_a$ of the MuPs system against annihilation of the electron-positron pair: $\tau_a = \frac{1}{\Gamma} \approx 4.071509 \cdot 10^{-10}$ $sec$. The hyperfine structure splitting of the ground state in the MuPs system evaluated with our expectation values is $\Delta \approx$ 23.064(5) $MHz$.

The consistency of the quantum-mechanical correlation laws with the existence of their correlata is demonstrated. The demonstration makes use of the fact (which is implied by the indeterminacy principle) that physical space is not partitioned "all the way down," and it requires that the eigenvalue-eigenstate link be replaced by a different interpretive principle, whose implications are explored.

Using the thin-layer quantization scheme to constrain the particle on $\mathcal{S}$, and in the transformed spinor representations, we obtain the well-known geometric potential $V_g$ and the presence of $e^{-i\varphi}$, which can generate additive spin connection geometric potentials by the curvilinear coordinate derivatives, and we find that the two fundamental evidences in the literature [Giulio Ferrari and Giampaolo Cuoghi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 230403 (2008).] are still valid in the present system without source current perpendicular to $\mathcal{S}$. Finally, we apply the surface Pauli equation to spherical, cylindrical, and toroidal surfaces, in which we obtain expectantly the geometric potentials and new spin connection geometric potentials, and find that only the normal Pauli matrix appears in these equations.

abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body systems are one of the most interesting tasks of quantum technology. Among them is the preparation of a many-body system in its ground state when the vanishing energy gap makes the cooling mechanisms ineffective. Adiabatic theorem, as an alternative to cooling, can be exploited for driving the many-body system to its ground state. In this paper, we study two most common disorders in quantum dot arrays, namely exchange coupling fluctuations and hyperfine interaction, in adiabatically preparation of ground state in such systems. We show that the adiabatic ground state preparation is highly robust against those disorder effects making it good analog simulator. Moreover, we also study the adiabatic classical information transfer, using singlet-triplet states, across a spin chain. In contrast to ground state preparation the transfer mechanism is highly affected by disorder and in particular, the hyperfine interaction is very destructive for the performance. This suggests that for communication tasks across such arrays adiabatic evolution is not as effective and quantum quenches could be preferable.

abstract: We experimentally realize "hybrid" entanglement swapping between discrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) optical systems. DV two-mode entanglement as obtainable from a single photon split at a beam splitter is robustly transferred by means of efficient CV entanglement and operations, using sources of squeezed light and homodyne detections. The DV entanglement after the swapping is verified without post-selection by the logarithmic negativity of up to 0.28$\pm$0.01. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the optimally transferred state can be post-selected into a highly entangled state that violates a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by more than four standard deviations, and thus it may serve as resources for quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography.

Here we show how we can utilize this entanglement within the framework of time-continuous quantum control, in order to engineer the quantum state of the mechanical system. Specifically, we analyze how to prepare a low-entropy mechanical state by (measurement-based) feedback cooling operated in the blue detuned regime, the creation of bipartite mechanical entanglement via time-continuous entanglement swapping, and preparation of a squeezed mechanical state by time-continuous teleportation. The protocols presented here are feasible in optomechanical systems exhibiting a cooperativity larger than 1.

abstract: We analyze a heat machine based on a periodically-driven quantum system permanently coupled to hot and cold baths. It is shown that the maximal power output of a degenerate $V$-type three-level heat engine is that generated by two independent two-level systems. For $N$ levels, this maximal enhancement is $(N-1)$-fold. Hence, level degeneracy is a thermodynamic resource that may effectively boost the power output. The efficiency, however, is not affected. We find that coherence is not an essential asset in multilevel-based heat machines. The existence of multiple thermalization pathways sharing a common ground state suffices for power enhancement.

abstract: We present a strong parallel repetition theorem for the entangled value of multi-player, one-round free games (games where the inputs come from a product distribution). Our result is the first parallel repetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players. Furthermore, our theorem applies to games where the players are allowed to output (possibly entangled) quantum states as answers. More specifically, let $G$ be a $k$-player free game, with entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \epsilon$. We show that the entangled value of the $n$-fold repetition of $G$, $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n})$, is at most $(1 - \epsilon)^{\Omega(n/k^2)}$. In the traditional setting of $k=2$ players, our parallel repetition theorem is optimal in terms of its dependence on $\epsilon$ and $n$. For an arbitrary number of players, our result is nearly optimal: for all $k$, we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n > 1$ such that $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n}) \geq \mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$. Hence, exponent of the repeated game value cannot be improved beyond $\Omega(n/k)$. Our parallel repetition theorem improves on the prior results of [Jain, et al. 2014] and [Chailloux, Scarpa 2014] in a number of ways: (1) our theorem applies to a larger class of games (arbitrary number of players, quantum outputs); (2) we demonstrate that strong parallel repetition holds for the entangled value of free games: i.e., the base of the repeated game value is $1 - \epsilon$, rather than $1 - \epsilon^2$; and (3) there is no dependence of the repeated game value on the input and output alphabets of $G$. In contrast, it is known that the repeated game value of classical free games must depend on the output size. Thus our results demonstrate a seperation between the behavior of entangled games and classical games.

abstract: We consider a system subject to a quantum optical master equation at finite temperature and study a class of conditional dynamics obtained by monitoring its totally or partially purified environment. More specifically, drawing from the notion that the thermal state of the environment may be regarded as the local state of a lossy and noisy two-mode squeezed state, we consider conditional dynamics ("unravellings") resulting from the homodyne detection of the two modes of such a state. Thus, we identify a class of unravellings parametrised by the loss rate suffered by the environmental two-mode state, which interpolate between direct detection of the environmental mode alone (occurring for total loss, whereby no correlation between the two environmental modes is left) and full access to the purification of the bath (occurring when no loss is acting and the two-mode state of the environment is pure). We hence show that, while direct detection of the bath is not able to reach the maximal steady-state squeezing allowed by general-dyne unravellings, such optimal values can be obtained when a fully purified bath is accessible. More generally we show that, within our framework, any degree of access to the bath purification improves the performance of filtering protocols in terms of achievable squeezing and entanglement.

abstract: We show that a collection of two-level atoms in an optical cavity beyond the rotating wave approximation and in the dispersive and strong-coupling regime constitutes a nonlinear medium and is capable of generating squeezed state of light. It is found that squeezing produced in the strong-coupling regime is significantly higher compared to that produced in the dispersive limit. On the other hand, we also show that it could be possible to observe the Dicke superradiant quantum phase transition in the dispersive regime where the vector potential term is negligible. Such a system can be an essential component of a larger quantum-communication system.

abstract: The question of which two-qubit states are steerable (i.e. permit a demonstration of EPR-steering) remains open. Here, a strong necessary condition is obtained for the steerability of two-qubit states having maximally-mixed reduced states, via the construction of local hidden state models. It is conjectured that this condition is in fact sufficient. Two provably sufficient conditions are also obtained, via asymmetric EPR-steering inequalities. Our work uses ideas from the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism, and explicitly evaluates the integral of $\boldsymbol n/(\boldsymbol n^\intercal A\boldsymbol n)^2$ over arbitrary unit hemispheres for any positive matrix $A$.

abstract: In a previous paper a formalism to analyze the dynamical evolution of classical and quantum probability distributions in terms of their moments was presented. Here the application of this formalism to the system of a particle moving on a potential is considered in order to derive physical implications about the classical limit of a quantum system. The complete set of harmonic potentials is considered, which includes the particle under a uniform force, as well as the harmonic and the inverse harmonic oscillators. In addition, as an example of anharmonic system, the pure quartic oscillator is analyzed. Classical and quantum moments corresponding to stationary states of these systems are analytically obtained without solving any differential equation. Finally, dynamical states are also considered in order to study the differences between their classical and quantum evolution.

abstract: Modern x-ray light sources promise access to structure and dynamics of matter in largely unexplored spectral regions. However, the desired information is encoded in the light intensity and phase, whereas detectors register only the intensity. This phase problem is ubiquitous in crystallography and imaging, and impedes the exploration of quantum effects at x-ray energies. Here, we demonstrate phase-sensitive measurements characterizing the quantum state of a nuclear two-level system at hard x-ray energies. The nuclei are initially prepared in a superposition state. Subsequently, the relative phase of this superposition is interferometrically reconstructed from the emitted x-rays. Our results form a first step towards x-ray quantum state tomography, and provide new avenues for structure determination and precision metrology via x-ray Fano interference.

abstract: In the context of multiplayer games, the parallel repetition problem can be phrased as follows: given a game $G$ with optimal winning probability $1-\alpha$ and its repeated version $G^n$ (in which $n$ games are played together, in parallel), can the players use strategies that are substantially better than ones in which each game is played independently? This question is relevant in physics for the study of correlations and plays an important role in computer science in the context of complexity and cryptography. In this work the case of multiplayer non-signalling games is considered, i.e., the only restriction on the players is that they are not allowed to communicate during the game. For complete-support games (games where all possible combinations of questions have non-zero probability to be asked) with any number of players we prove a threshold theorem stating that the probability that non-signalling players win more than a fraction $1-\alpha+\beta$ of the $n$ games is exponentially small in $n\beta^2$, for every $0\leq \beta \leq \alpha$. For games with incomplete support we derive a similar statement, for a slightly modified form of repetition. The result is proved using a new technique, based on a recent de Finetti theorem, which allows us to avoid central technical difficulties that arise in standard proofs of parallel repetition theorems.

abstract: Spekkens' toy bit theory is a hidden variable theory which nevertheless reproduces significant parts of operational quantum mechanics. Here, we show that a graphical calculus induced from monoidal categories is complete for Spekkens' toy bit theory, i.e. any equality that can be derived in the toy bit theory can also be derived graphically. We do this by adapting a completeness proof for a similar graphical calculus for stabilizer quantum mechanics to the toy theory. In the process, we prove that graph states play a central role in Spekkens' toy bit theory, just as they do in stabilizer quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we show that the rewriting strategies used in the graphical calculus for stabilizer quantum mechanics work in the toy theory graphical calculus.

abstract: We revisit the treatment of identical particles in quantum mechanics. Two kinds of solutions of Schr\"{o}dinger equation are found and analyzed. First, the known symmetrized and antisymmetrized eigenfunctions. We examine how the very concept of particle is blurred whithin this approach. Second, we propose another kind of solution with no symmetries that we identify with Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. In it, particles do preserve their individuality, as they are provided with individual energy and momenta. However, these properties cannot be univocally ascribed; moreover, particles do not possess distinctive positions. Finally, we explore how these results affect the calculation of canonical partition function, and we show that extensivity arises as a consequence of identity.

abstract: We identify gauge freedoms in quantum error correction (QEC) codes and introduce strategies for optimal control algorithms to find the gauges which allow the easiest experimental realization. Hereby, the optimal gauge depends on the underlying physical system and the available means to manipulate it. The final goal is to obtain optimal decompositions of QEC codes into elementary operations which can be realized with high experimental fidelities. In the first part of this paper, this subject is studied in a general fashion, while in the second part, a system of trapped ions is treated as a concrete example. A detailed optimization algorithm is explained and various decompositions are presented for the three qubit code, the five qubit code and the seven qubit Steane code.

abstract: We investigate the transport of phonons between $N$ harmonic oscillators in contact with independent thermal baths and coupled to a common oscillator, and derive an expression for the steady state heat flow between the oscillators in the weak coupling limit. We apply these results to an optomechanical array consisting of a pair of mechanical resonators coupled to a single quantised electromagnetic field mode by radiation pressure as well as to thermal baths with different temperatures. In the weak coupling limit this system is shown to be equivalent to two mutually-coupled harmonic oscillators in contact with an effective common thermal bath in addition to their independent baths. The steady state occupation numbers and heat flows are derived and discussed in various regimes of interest.

abstract: Around 1930, both Gregory Breit and Erwin Schroedinger showed that the eigenvalues of the velocity of a particle described by wavepacket solutions to the Dirac equation are simply $\pm$c, the speed of light. This led Schroedinger to coin the term Zitterbewegung, which is German for "trembling motion", where all particles of matter (fermions) zig-zag back-and-forth at only the speed of light. The result is that any finite speed less than $c$, including the state of rest, only makes sense as a long-term average that can be thought of as a drift velocity. In this paper, we seriously consider this idea that the observed velocities of particles are time-averages of motion at the speed of light and demonstrate how the relativistic velocity addition rule in one spatial dimension is readily derived by considering the probabilities that a particle is observed to move either to the left or to the right at the speed of light.

abstract: Negative values of the Casimir entropy occur quite frequently at low temperatures in arrangements of metallic objects. The physical reason lies either in the dissipative nature of the metals as is the case for the plane-plane geometry or in the geometric form of the objects involved. Examples for the latter are the sphere-plane and the sphere-sphere geometry, where negative Casimir entropies can occur already for perfect metal objects. After appropriately scaling out the size of the objects, negative Casimir entropies of geometric origin are particularly pronounced in the limit of large distances between the objects. We analyze this limit in terms of the different scattering channels and demonstrate how the negativity of the Casimir entropy is related to the polarization mixing arising in the scattering process. If all involved objects have a finite zero-frequency conductivity, the channels involving transverse electric modes are suppressed and the Casimir entropy within the large-distance limit is found to be positive.

abstract: An approach to quantum mechanics is developed which makes the Heisenberg cut between the deterministic microscopic quantum world and the partly deterministic, partly stochastic macroscopic world explicit. The microscopic system evolves according to the Schrodinger equation with stochastic behaviour arising when the system is probed by a set of coarse grained macroscopic observables whose resolution scale defines the Heisenberg cut. The resulting stochastic process can account for the different facets of the classical limit: Newton's laws (ergodicity broken); statistical mechanics of thermal ensembles (ergodic); and solve the measurement problem (partial ergodicity breaking). In particular, the usual rules of the Copenhagen interpretation, like the Born rule, emerge, along with completely local descriptions of EPR type experiments. The formalism also re-introduces a dynamical picture of equilibration and thermalization in quantum statistical mechanics and provides insight into how classical statistical mechanics can arise in the classical limit and in a way that alleviates various conceptual problems.

abstract: This paper discusses how the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics can provide for a natural account of the emergence of spacetime events from a quantum substratum. In this account, spacetime is not a substantive manifold that becomes occupied with events; rather, spacetime itself exists only in virtue of specific actualized events. This implies that spacetime is discrete rather than continuous, and that properties attributed to spacetime based on the notion of a continuum are idealizations that do not apply to the real physical world. It is further noted that the transactional picture of the emergence of spacetime can provide the quantum dynamics that underlie the causal set approach as proposed by Sorkin and others.

abstract: Within the frame of quantized dark-state polaritons in electromagnetically-induced-transparency media, noise fluctuations in the quadrature components are studied. Squeezed state transfer, quantum correlation, and noise entanglement between probe field and atomic polarization are demonstrated in single- and double-$\Lambda$ configurations, respectively. Even though a larger degree of squeezing parameter in the continuous variable helps to establish stronger quantum correlations, inseparability criterion is satisfied only within a finite range of squeezing parameter. The results obtained in the present study may be useful for guiding experimental realization of quantum memory devices for possible applications in quantum information and computation.

abstract: In recent works, Knuth and Bahreyni have demonstrated that the concepts of space and time are emergent in a coarse-grained model of direct particle-particle influence. In addition, Knuth demonstrated that observer-made inferences regarding the free particle, which is defined as a particle that influences others, but is not itself influenced, result in a situation identical to the Feynman checkerboard model of the Dirac equation. This suggests that the same theoretical framework that gives rise to an emergent spacetime is consistent with quantum mechanics. In this paper, we begin to explore the effect of influence on the emergent properties of a particle. This initial study suggests that when a particle is influenced, it is interpreted as accelerating in a manner consistent with special relativity implying that, at least in this situation, influence can be conceived of as a force.

abstract: A crucial requirement for scalable quantum-information processing is the realization of multiple-qubit quantum gates. Universal multiple-qubit gates can be implemented by a set of universal single qubit gates and any one kind of two-qubit gate, such as a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. Semiconductor quantum dot qubits are a leading approach for the physical implementation of quantum computation, due to their potential for large-scale integration. Two-qubit gate operations have been so far only demonstrated in individual electron spin-based quantum dot systems. Due to the relatively short de-coherence time, charge qubits in quantum dots are generally considered to be inferior for going beyond single qubit level. Here, we demonstrate the benchmarking CNOT gate in two capacitively coupled charge qubits, each consisting of an electron confined in a GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum dot. Owing to the strong inter-qubit coupling strength, gate operations with a clock speed up to 5GHz has been realized. A processing tomography shows encouragingly that the universal two-qubit gate operations have comparable fidelities to that of spin-based two-qubit gates. Our results suggest that semiconductor charge qubits have a considerable potential for scalable quantum computing and may stimulate the use of long-range Coulomb interaction for coherent quantum control in other devices.

abstract: We study the optomechanical coupling of a single-layer graphene with a high-Q Fabry-Perot microcavity in the membrane-in-the-middle configuration. In ordinary dissipative coupling systems, mechanical oscillators modulate the loss associated with the input coupling of the cavity mode; while in our system, the graphene oscillator couples dissipatively with the cavity mode through modulating its absorption loss. By analyzing the effects of the interband transition of a graphene suspended near the node of the cavity field, we obtain strong and tunable dissipative coupling without excessively reducing the optical quality factor. Finally, it is found that the flexural mode of the graphene could be cooled down to its ground state in the present coupling system. This study provides new insights for graphene optomechanics in the visible range.

abstract: The field of quantum information has been growing fast over the past decade. Optical quantum computation, based on the concepts of KLM and cluster states, has witnessed experimental realizations of larger and more complex systems in terms of photon number. Quantum optical systems, which offer long coherence times and easy manipulation of single qubits, allow us to probe quantum properties of the light itself and of the physical systems around it. Recently, a linear scheme for quantum computing, relying on the bosonic nature of particles, has been proposed and realized experimentally with photons. The ability to efficiently measure superpositions of quantum states consisting of several photons is essential to the characterization of such systems. In fact, the entire field of quantum information completely relies on the ability to recover quantum states from measurements. However, the characterization of quantum states requires many measurements, and often necessitates complicated measurements schemes; for example, characterizing qubits requires measurements. Here, we utilize structure, inherent to physically interesting quantum states of light, in order to reduce the complexity in the recovery of a quantum state. In particular, we devise a method enabling the recovery of three-photon quantum states from only two-fold correlation measurements in a single setting. The ability to take two-fold coincidences instead of three-fold offers the recovery of the quantum states in far less measurements and in a considerably higher SNR, because detection of two-photon events is much more likely than that of three-photon ones. The concept suggested here paves the way to further ideas on structure-based super resolution in quantum state tomography, such as recovering a quantum state in an unknown basis in a single setup and recovering the state of several photons without number resolving detectors.

abstract: We present a formal theory of contextuality for a set of random variables grouped into different subsets (contexts) corresponding to different, mutually incompatible conditions. Within each context the random variables are jointly distributed, but across different contexts they are stochastically unrelated. The theory of contextuality is based on the analysis of the extent to which some of these random variables can be viewed as preserving their identity across different contexts when one considers all possible joint distributions imposed on the entire set of the random variables. We illustrate the theory on three systems of traditional interest in quantum physics (and also in non-physical, e.g., behavioral studies). These are systems of the Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky-type, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bell-type, and Suppes-Zanotti-Leggett-Garg-type. Listed in this order, each of them is formally a special case of the previous one. For each of them we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for contextuality while allowing for experimental errors and contextual biases or signaling. Based on the same principles that underly these derivations we also propose a measure for the degree of contextuality and compute it for the three systems in question.

abstract: After reviewing the description of an unstable state in the framework of nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics (QM) and relativistic Quantum Field Theory (QFT), we consider the effect of pulsed, ideal measurements repeated at equal time intervals on the lifetime of an unstable system. In particular, we investigate the case in which the `bare' survival probability is an exact exponential (a very good approximation in both QM and QFT), but the measurement apparatus can detect the decay products only in a certain energy range. We show that the Quantum Zeno Effect can occur in this framework as well.

abstract: A simple quantum interaction is analyzed, where the paths of two superposed particles asymmetrically cross, while a detector set to detect an interaction between them remains silent. Despite this negative result, the particles' states leave no doubt that a peculiar interaction has occurred: One particle's momentum changes while the other's remains unaffected, in apparent violation of momentum conservation. Revisiting the foundations of the quantum measurement process offers the resolution. Prior to the macroscopic recording of no interaction, a brief Critical Interval prevails, during which the particles and the detector's pointer form a subtle entanglement which immediately dissolves. It is this self-cancellation, henceforth "Quantum Oblivion (QO)," that lies at the basis of some well-known intriguing quantum effects. Such is Interaction-Free Measurement (IFM) [1] and its more paradoxical variants, like Hardy's Paradox [2] and the Quantum Liar Paradox [3]. Even the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect [4] and weak measurement [5] turn out to belong to this group. We next study interventions within the Critical Interval that produce some other peculiar effects. Finally we discuss some of the conceptual issues involved. Under the time-resolution of the Critical Interval, some nonlocal phenomena turn out to be local. Momentum is conserved due to the quantum uncertainties inflicted by the particle-pointer interaction, which sets the experiment's final boundary condition.

abstract: We present a novel discussion of the continuous-time quantum error correction introduced by Paz and Zurek in 1998 [Paz and Zurek, Proc. R. Soc. A 454, 355 (1998)]. We study the general Lindbladian which describes the effects of both noise and error correction in the weak-noise (or strong-correction) regime through a perturbative expansion. We use this tool to derive quantitative aspects of the continuous-time dynamics both in general and through two illustrative examples: the 3-qubit and the 5-qubit stabilizer codes, which can be independently solved by analytical and numerical methods and then used as benchmarks for the perturbative approach. The perturbatively accessible time frame features a short initial transient in which error correction is ineffective, followed by a slow decay of the information content consistent with the known facts about discrete-time error correction in the limit of fast operations. This behavior is explained in the two case studies through a geometric description of the continuous transformation of the state space induced by the combined action of noise and error correction.

authors: Horace Yuen

abstract: Privacy amplification is a necessary step in all quantum key distribution protocols, and error correction is needed in each except when signals of many photons are used in the key communication in quantum noise approach. No security analysis of error correcting code information leak to the attacker has ever been provided, while an ad hoc formula is currently employed to account for such leak in the key generation rate. It is also commonly believed that privacy amplification allows the users to at least establish a short key of arbitrarily close to perfect security. In this paper we show how the lack of rigorous error correction analysis makes the otherwise valid privacy amplification results invalid, and that there exists a limit on how close to perfect a generated key can be obtained from privacy amplification. In addition, there is a necessary tradeoff between key rate and security, and the best theoretical values from current theories would not generate enough near-uniform key bits to cover the message authentication key cost in disturbance-information tradeoff protocols of the BB84 variety.

abstract: We study the problem of constructing multi-source extractors in the quantum setting, which extract almost uniform random bits against quantum side information collected from several initially independent classical random sources. This is a natural generalization of seeded randomness extraction against quantum side information and classical independent source extraction. With new challenges such as potential entanglement in the side information, it is not a prior clear under what conditions do quantum multi-source extractors exist; the only previous work is [KK12], where the classical inner-product two-source extractors of [CG88] and [DEOR04] are shown to be quantum secure in the restricted Independent Adversary (IA) Model and entangled Bounded Storage (BS) Model. In this paper we propose a new model called General Entangled (GE) Adversary Model, which allows arbitrary entanglement in the side information and subsumes both the IA model and the BS model. We proceed to show how to construct GE-secure quantum multi-source extractors. To that end, we propose another model called One-sided Adversary (OA) Model, which is weaker than all the above models. Somewhat surprisingly, we establish equivalence between strong OA-security and strong GE-security. As a result, all classical multi-source extractors can either directly work, or be modified to work in the GE model at the cost of one extra random source. Thus, our constructions essentially match the best known constructions of classical multi-source extractors. We also apply our techniques to two important problems in cryptography and distributed computing --- privacy amplification and network extractor. We show that as long as the sources have certain amounts of conditional min-entropy in our GE model (even with entangled quantum side information), we can design very efficient privacy amplification protocols and network extractors.

abstract: We study three-body recombination in two dimensions for systems interacting via short-range two-body interactions in the regime of large scattering lengths. Using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation, we derive semi-analytical formulas for three-body recombination in both weakly and deeply bound diatom states. Our results demonstrate the importance of long-range corrections to the three-body potentials by showing how they alter the low-energy and scattering length dependence of the recombination rate for both bosonic and fermionic systems, which exhibit suppressed recombination if compared to the three-dimensional case. We verify these results through numerical calculations of recombination for systems with finite-range interactions and supporting a few two-body bound states. We also study finite-range effects for the energies of the universal three-identical-bosons states and found a slow approach to universal predictions as a function of the scattering length.

abstract: The unknown temperature of a sample may be estimated with minimal disturbance by putting it in thermal contact with an individual quantum probe. If the interaction time is sufficiently long so that the probe thermalizes, the temperature can be read out directly from its steady state. Here we prove that the optimal quantum probe, acting as a thermometer with maximal thermal sensitivity, is an effective two-level atom with a maximally degenerate excited state. When the total interaction time is insufficient to produce full thermalization, we optimize the estimation protocol by breaking it down into sequential stages of probe preparation, thermal contact and measurement. We observe that frequently interrogated probes initialized in the ground state achieve the best performance. For both fully and partly thermalized thermometers, the sensitivity grows significantly with the number of levels, though optimization over their energy spectrum remains always crucial.

Furthermore, we propose an optimal architecture for this model and discuss the benchmarking of the simulations in realistic circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.

abstract: We study a set of new functionals (called entanglement--breaking indices) which characterize how many local iterations of a given (local) quantum channel are needed in order to completely destroy the entanglement between the system of interest over which the transformation is defined and an external ancilla. The possibility of contrasting the noisy effects introduced by the channel iterations via the action of intermediate ({\it filtering}) transformations is analyzed. We provide some examples in which our functionals can be exactly calculated. The differences between unitary and non-unitary filtering operations are analyzed showing that, at least for systems of dimension $d$ larger than or equal to 3, the non-unitary choice is preferable (the gap between the performances of the two cases being divergent in some cases). For $d=2$ (qubit case) on the contrary no evidences of the presence of such gap is revealed: we conjecture that for this special case unitary filtering transformations are optimal. The scenario in which more general filtering protocols are allowed is also discussed in some detail. The case of a depolarizing noise acting on a two--qubit system is exactly solved in a general case.

abstract: Relativistic theory of the Cox's scalar not point-like particle with intrinsic structure is developed on the background of arbitrary curved space-time. It is shown that in the most general form, the extended Proca-like tensor first order system of equations contains non minimal interaction terms through electromagnetic tensor F_{\alpha \beta} and Ricci tensor R_{\alpha \beta}. In relativistic Cox's theory, the limiting procedure to non-relativistic approximation is performed in a special class of curved space-time models. This theory is specified in simple geometrical backgrounds: Euclid's, Lobachevsky's, and Rie\-mann's. Wave equation for the Cox's particle is solved exactly in presence of external uniform magnetic and electric fields in the case of Minkowski space. Non-trivial additional structure of the particle modifies the frequency of a quantum oscillator arising effectively in presence if external magnetic field. Extension of these problems to the case of the hyperbolic Lobachevsky space is examined. In presence of the magnetic field, the quantum problem in radial variable has been solved exactly; the quantum motion in z-direction is described by 1-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation in an effective potential which turns out to be too difficult for analytical treatment. In the presence of electric field, the situation is similar. The same analysis has been performed for spherical Riemann space model.

abstract: Previously, a formula, incorporating a $5F4$ hypergeometric function, for the Hilbert-Schmidt-averaged determinantal moments $\left\langle \left\vert \rho^{PT}\right\vert ^{n}\left\vert \rho\right\vert ^{k}\right\rangle /\left\langle \left\vert \rho\right\vert ^{k}\right\rangle$ of $4 \times 4$ density-matrices ($\rho$), and their partial transposes ($\rho^{PT}|$) was applied with $k=0$ to the generalized two-qubit separability-probability question. The formula can, further, be viewed we note here, as an averaging over "induced measures in the space of mixed quantum states". The associated induced-measure separability probabilities ($k =1, 2,\ldots$) are found--{\it via} a high-precision density approximation procedure--to assume interesting, relatively simple rational values in the two-re[al]bit ($\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$), (standard) two-qubit ($\alpha = 1$) and two-quater[nionic]bit ($\alpha =2$) cases. We deduce rather simple companion (rebit, qubit, quaterbit,\ldots) formulas that successfully reproduce the rational values assumed for {\it general} $k$. These formulas are observed to share certain features, possibly allowing them to be incorporated into a single master formula.

abstract: We discuss how to analytically obtain an -- essentially infinite -- Matrix Product State (MPS) representation of the ground state of the XY model. On the one hand this allows to illustrate how the algebraic part of the correlation function emerges in the exact case using standard MPS language. On the other hand we study the consequences of truncating the bond dimension of the exact MPS which is also part of many tensor network algorithms and we focus on how well the truncated MPS transfer matrix reproduces the dominant part of the exact quantum transfer matrix. In the gapped phase we observe that the correlation length obtained from a truncated MPS approaches the exact value following a power law in effective bond dimension. In the gapless phase we find a good match between a state obtained numerically from standard MPS techniques with finite bond dimension, and a state obtained by effective finite imaginary time evolution in our framework. This provides a direct hint for a geometric interpretation of Finite Entanglement Scaling at the critical point.

We present a metrological tool, based on randomized benchmarking, capable of greatly increasing the precision of Ramsey and spin echo sequences by the repeated but incoherent addition of phase noise. We find our SQUID-based qubit is not limited by $1/f$ flux noise at short timescales, but instead observe a telegraph noise mechanism that is not amenable to study with standard measurement techniques.

abstract: We study a scheme for implementing a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between two neutral-atom qubits based on the Rydberg blockade mechanism in a manner that is robust to errors caused by atomic motion. By employing adiabatic dressing of the ground electronic state, we can protect the gate from decoherence due to random phase errors that typically arise because of atomic thermal motion. In addition, the adiabatic protocol allows for a Doppler-free configuration that involves counterpropagating lasers in a $\sigma_+/\sigma_-$ orthogonal polarization geometry that further reduces motional errors due to Doppler shifts. The residual motional error is dominated by dipole-dipole forces acting on doubly-excited Rydberg atoms when the blockade is imperfect. For reasonable parameters, with qubits encoded into the clock states of $^{133}$Cs, we predict that our protocol could produce a CZ gate in $<10$ $\mu$s with error probability on the order of $10^{-3}$.

abstract: We undertake a thorough analysis of the thermodynamics of the trajectories followed by a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to $N$ dissipative baths by using a new approach to large-deviation theory inspired by phase-space quantum optics. As an illustrative example, we study the archetypal case of a harmonic oscillator coupled to two thermal baths, allowing for a comparison with the analogous classical result. In the low-temperature limit, we find a significant quantum suppression in the rate of work exchanged between the system and each bath. We further show how the presented method is capable of giving analytical results even for the case of a driven harmonic oscillator. Based on that result, we analyse the laser cooling of the motion of a trapped ion or optomechanical system, illustrating how the emission statistics can be controllably altered by the driving force.

abstract: We investigate the disturbance of the state of a quantum system in a protective measurement for finite measurement times and different choices of the time-dependent system-apparatus coupling function. The ability to minimize this state disturbance is essential to protective measurement. We show that for a coupling strength that remains constant during the measurement interaction of duration $T$, the state disturbance scales as $T^{-2}$, while a simple smoothing of the coupling function significantly improves the scaling behavior to $T^{-6}$. We also prove that the shift of the apparatus pointer in the course of a protective measurement is independent of the particular time dependence of the coupling function, suggesting that the guiding principle for choosing the coupling function should be the minimization of the state disturbance. Our results illuminate the dynamics of protective measurement under realistic circumstances and may aid in the experimental realization of such measurements.

A spin-orbit coupling through a kicked magnetic field confined to a compact region in space leads to irregular scattering and triggers spin flips in a spatially asymmetric manner which allows to generate polarized currents. The dynamical mechanisms responsible for the spin separation carry over to the quantum level and give rise to spin pumping. Our theory, based on the Floquet formalism, is confirmed by numerical solutions of the time-dependent inhomogeneous Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a continuous source term.

abstract: We review a recent approach to the foundations of quantum mechanics inspired by quantum information theory. The approach is based on a general framework, which allows one to address a large class of physical theories which share basic information-theoretic features. We first illustrate two very primitive features, expressed by the axioms of causality and purity-preservation, which are satisfied by both classical and quantum theory. We then discuss the axiom of purification, which expresses a strong version of the Conservation of Information and captures the core of a vast number of protocols in quantum information. Purification is a highly non-classical feature and leads directly to the emergence of entanglement at the purely conceptual level, without any reference to the superposition principle. Supplemented by a few additional requirements, satisfied by classical and quantum theory, it provides a complete axiomatic characterization of quantum theory for finite dimensional systems.

abstract: A long standing problem in quantum mechanics is the minimum number of observables required for the characterisation of unknown pure quantum states. The solution to this problem is specially important for the developing field of high-dimensional quantum information processing. In this work we demonstrate that any pure d-dimensional state is unambiguously reconstructed by measuring 5 observables, that is, via projective measurements onto the states of 5 orthonormal bases. Thus, in our method the total number of different measurement outcomes (5d) scales linearly with d. The state reconstruction is robust against experimental errors and requires simple post-processing, regardless of d. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our scheme through the reconstruction of 8-dimensional quantum states, encoded in the momentum of single photons.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2797
abstract: In this work we investigate the relation between quantum measurements and decoherence, in order to formally express the necessity of the latter for obtaining an informative output from the former. To this aim, referring to the Von Neumann scheme for ideal quantum measurements, we first look for the minimal structure that the interaction between principal system and measurement apparatus must have for properly describing the process, beyond the quantum measurement limit, and then analyze the dynamical evolution induced by one such interaction. The analysis is developed by means of a recently introduced method for studying open quantum systems, namely the parametric representation with environmental coherent states, that allows us to determine a necessary condition that the quantum state of the apparatus must fullfil in order to give information on the observable being measured. We find that this condition strictly implies decoherence in the principal system, with respect to the eigenstates of the hermitian operator that represents the measured observable, thus establishing that there cannot be information flux from a quantum system towards a readable analyser unless decoherence occurs. The relevance of dynamical entanglement generation is highlighted, and consequences of the possible macroscopic structure of the measurement apparatus are also commented upon.

In non relativistic quantum theory the instantaneous velocity can be measured to any desired accuracy.

Optical transition line widths, transition wavelength and excited state lifetimes are measured for the temperature range 4-350 K. The ground state orbital relaxation rates are measured using time-resolved fluorescence techniques. A microscopic model of the thermal broadening in the excited and ground states of the $\mathrm{SiV}^-$ centre is developed. A vibronic process involving single-phonon transitions is found to determine orbital relaxation rates for both the ground and the excited states at cryogenic temperatures. We discuss the implications of our findings for coherence of qubit states in the ground states and propose methods to extend coherence times of $\mathrm{SiV}^-$ qubits.

abstract: We consider a three-level quantum system interacting with a bosonic thermal reservoir. Two energy levels of the system are nearly degenerate but well separated from the third one. The system-reservoir interaction constant is larger than the energy difference of the degenerate levels, but it is smaller than the separation between the latter and the remaining level. We show that the quasi-degeneracy of energy levels leads to the existence of a manifold of quasi-stationary states, and the dynamics exhibits two characteristic time scales. On the first, shorter one, initial states approach the quasi-stationary manifold. Then, on the much longer second time scale, the final unique equilibrium is reached.

abstract: Novel quantization properties related to the state vectors and the energy spectrum of a two-dimensional system of free particles are obtained in the framework of noncommutative (NC) quantum mechanics (QM) supported by the Weyl-Wigner formalism. Besides reproducing the magnetic field aspect of a Zeeman-like effect, the momentum space NC parameter introduces mutual information properties quantified by the quantum purity related to the relevant coordinates of the corresponding Hilbert space. Supported by the QM in the phase-space, the thermodynamic limit is obtained, and the results are extended to three-dimensional systems. The noncommutativity imprints on the thermodynamic variables related to free particles are identified and, after introducing some suitable constraints to fix an axial symmetry, the analysis is extended to two- and- three dimensional quantum rotor systems, for which the quantization aspects and the deviation from standard QM results are verified.

abstract: We study analytically the time-dependent boundary conditions of superconducting microwave circuit experiments in the high plasma frequency limit, in which the conditions are Robin-type and relate the value of the field to the spatial derivative of the field. We give an explicit solution to the field evolution for boundary condition modulations that are small in magnitude but may have arbitrary time dependence, in a formalism that applies both to a semiopen waveguide and to a closed waveguide with two independently adjustable boundaries. The correspondence between the microwave Robin boundary conditions and the mechanically-moving Dirichlet boundary conditions of the Dynamical Casimir Effect is shown to break down at high field frequencies, approximately one order of magnitude above the frequencies probed in the 2011 experiment of Wilson et al. Our results bound the parameter regime in which a microwave circuit can be used to model relativistic effects in a mechanically-moving cavity, and they show that beyond this parameter regime moving mirrors produce more particles and generate more entanglement than their non-moving microwave waveguide simulations.

abstract: Many superresolution microscopic techniques rely on the accurate localization of optical point sources from far field. To investigate the fundamental limits to their resolution, here I derive measurement-independent quantum lower bounds on the error of locating point sources in free space, taking full account of the quantum, nonparaxial, and vectoral nature of photons. To arrive at analytic results, I focus mainly on the cases of one and two classical monochromatic sources with an initial vacuum optical state. For one source, a lower bound on the root-mean-square position estimation error is on the order of $\lambda_0/\sqrt{N}$, where $\lambda_0$ is the free-space wavelength and $N$ is the average number of radiated photons. For two sources, owing to a nuisance parameter effect, the error bound diverges when their radiated fields overlap significantly. The use of squeezed light to further enhance the accuracy of locating one classical point source and the localization limits for single-photon sources and partially coherent sources are also discussed.

abstract: We study the driven-dissipative dynamics of a network of spin-1/2 systems coupled to one or more chiral 1D bosonic waveguides within the framework of a Markovian master equation. We determine how the interplay between a coherent drive and collective decay processes can lead to the formation of pure multipartite entangled steady states. The key ingredient for the emergence of these many-body dark states is an asymmetric coupling of the spins to left and right propagating guided modes. Such systems are motived by experimental possibilities with internal states of atoms coupled to optical fibers, or motional states of trapped atoms coupled to a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We discuss the characterization of the emerging multipartite entanglement in this system in terms of the Fisher information.

abstract: We find the analytic expressions for the Casimir free energy, entropy and pressure at low temperature in the configuration of two parallel plates made of magnetodielectic material. The cases of constant and frequency-dependent dielectic permittivity and magnetic permeability of the plates are considered. Special attention is paid to the account of dc conductivity. It is shown that in the case of finite static dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability the Nernst heat theorem for the Casimir entropy is satisfied. If the dc conductivity is taken into account, the Casimir entropy goes to a positive nonzero limit depending on the parameters of a system when the temperature vanishes, i.e., the Nernst theorem is violated. The experimental situation is also discussed.

abstract: Phenomenologically important quantum dissipative processes include black-body friction (an atom absorbs counterpropagating blue-shifted photons and spontaneously emits them in all directions, losing kinetic energy) and non-contact van der Waals friction (in the vicinity of a dielectric surface, the mirror charges of the constituent particles inside the surface experience drag, slowing the atom). The theoretical predictions for these processes are modified upon a rigorous quantum electrodynamic (QED) treatment, which shows that the one-loop "correction" yields the dominant contribution to the off-resonant, gauge-invariant, imaginary part of the atom's polarizability at room temperature, for typical atom-surface interactions. The tree-level contribution to the polarizability dominates at high temperature.

abstract: Quantum correlations in a composite system can be measured by resorting to a geometric approach, according to which the distance from the state of the system to a suitable set of classically correlated states is considered. Here we show that all distance functions, which respect natural assumptions of invariance under transposition, convexity, and contractivity under quantum channels, give rise to geometric quantifiers of quantum correlations which exhibit the peculiar freezing phenomenon, i.e., remain constant during the evolution of a paradigmatic class of states of two qubits each independently interacting with a non-dissipative decohering environment. Our results demonstrate from first principles that freezing of geometric quantum correlations is independent of the adopted distance and therefore universal. This finding paves the way to a deeper physical interpretation and future practical exploitation of the phenomenon for noisy quantum technologies.

abstract: It is commonly believed that area laws for entanglement entropies imply that a quantum many-body state can be faithfully represented by efficient tensor network states - a conjecture frequently stated in the context of numerical simulations and analytical considerations. In this work, we show that this is in general not the case, except in one dimension. We prove that the set of quantum many-body states that satisfy an area law for all Renyi entropies contains a subspace of exponential dimension. Establishing a novel link between quantum many-body theory and the theory of communication complexity, we then show that there are states satisfying area laws for all Renyi entropies but cannot be approximated by states with a classical description of small Kolmogorov complexity, including polynomial projected entangled pair states (PEPS) or states of multi-scale entanglement renormalisation (MERA). Not even a quantum computer with post-selection can efficiently prepare all quantum states fulfilling an area law, and we show that not all area law states can be eigenstates of local Hamiltonians. We also prove translationally invariant and isotropic instances of these results, and show a variation with decaying correlations using quantum error-correcting codes.

abstract: The surface code is one of the most promising candidates for combating errors in large scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. A fault-tolerant decoder is a vital part of the error correction process---it is the algorithm which computes the operations needed to correct or compensate for the errors according to the measured syndrome, even when the measurement itself is error prone. Previously decoders based on minimum-weight perfect matching have been studied. However, these are computationally expensive and not immediately generalizable from qubit to qudit codes. In this work, we develop a fast fault-tolerant decoder for the surface code, capable of efficient operation for qubits and qudits of any dimension, generalizing the decoder first introduced by Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 200501 (2013)]. We study its performance when both the physical qudits and the syndromes measurements are subject to generalized uncorrelated bit-flip noise (and the higher dimensional equivalent). We show that, with appropriate enhancements to the decoder and a high enough qudit dimension, a threshold at an error rate of more than 8% can be achieved.

Using this notion, we reconstruct the structural features of the task of state discrimination, such as the equivalence with cloning and the impossibility to extract information from two non-distinguishable pure states without causing a disturbance. All these features express intrinsic links among operational tasks, which are valid independently of the particular theory under consideration.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering describes how different ensembles of quantum states can be remotely prepared by measuring one particle of an entangled pair. Here, inspired by this bipartite concept, we investigate quantum steering for single quantum d-level systems (qudits) and devise several quantum witnesses to efficiently verify the steerability therein, which are applicable both to single-system steering and EPR steering. In the single-system case our steering witnesses enable the unambiguous ruling-out of generic classical means of mimicking steering. Ruling out false-steering scenarios has implications for securing channels against both cloning-based individual attack and coherent attacks when implementing quantum key distribution using qudits. In addition, we show that these steering witnesses also have applications in quantum information, in that they can serve as an efficient criterion for the evaluation of quantum logic gates of arbitrary size. Finally, we describe how the non-local EPR variant of these witnesses also function as tools for identifying faithful one-way quantum computation and secure entanglement-based quantum communication.

title: A survey of the ESR model for an objective reinterpretation of quantum mechanics
authors: Claudio Garola
comments: 12 pages

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Most scholars concerned with the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) think that contextuality and nonlocality (hence nonobjectivity of physical properties) are unavoidable features of QM which follow from the mathematical apparatus of QM. Moreover these features are usually considered as basic in quantum information processing. Nevertheless they raise still unsolved problems, as the objectification problem in the quantum theory of measurement. The extended semantic realism (ESR) model offers a possible way out from these difficulties by embedding the mathematical formalism of QM into a broader mathematical formalism and reinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional on detection rather than absolute. The embedding allows to recover the formal apparatus of QM within the ESR model, and the reinterpretation of QM allows to construct a noncontextual hidden variables theory which justifies the assumptions introduced in the ESR model and proves its objectivity. According to the ESR model both linear and nonlinear time evolution occur, depending on the physical environment, as in QM. In addition, the ESR model, though objective, implies modified Bell's inequalities that do not conflict with QM, supplies different mathematical representations of proper and improper mixtures, provides a general framework in which the local interpretations of the GHZ experiment obtained by other authors are recovered and explained, and supports an interpretation of quantum logic which avoids the introduction of the problematic notion of quantum truth.

abstract: Laser cooling of mesoscopic mechanical resonators is of great interest for both fundamental studies and practical applications. We provide a general framework to describe the cavity-assisted backaction cooling in the strong coupling regime. By studying the cooling dynamics, we find that the temporal evolution of mean phonon number oscillates as a function of the optomechanical coupling strength depending on frequency mixing. The further analytical result reveals that the optimal cooling limit is obtained when the system eigenmodes satisfy the frequency matching condition. The reduced instantaneous-state cooling limits with dynamic dissipative cooling approach are also presented. Our study provides a guideline for optimizing the backaction cooling of mesoscopic mechanical resonators in the strong coupling regime.

abstract: The W-type entangled states can be used as quantum channels for quantum teleportation, quantum dense coding, quantum key distribution, and so on. In this work we propose a way to generate a macroscopic W-type entangled coherent state of quantum memories in circuit QED. The memories considered here are nitrogen-vacancy center ensembles (NVEs) each located in a different cavity. This proposal does not require initially preparing each NVE in a coherent state instead of a ground state, which significantly reduces the experimental difficulty. For most of the operation time, each cavity remains in a vacuum state, thus decoherence caused by the cavity decay is greatly suppressed. Moreover, only one external-cavity coupler qubit is needed, and the operation time does not increase with the number of NVEs and cavities. The prepared W state can be stored via NVEs for a long time, mapped onto cavities, and then transferred into a quantum network via optical fibers each linked to a cavity, for potential applications in quantum communication. The method is quite general and can be applied to generate the proposed W state with atomic ensembles or other spin ensembles distributed in different cavities.

abstract: In this work we analyze a quantum communication scheme for entanglement-based continuous variable quantum key distribution between two ground stations. Communication occurs via a satellite over two independent atmospheric fading channels dominated by turbulence-induced beam wander. In this scheme the engineering complexity remains largely on the ground transceivers, with the satellite acting simply as a reflector. We show how the use of a highly selective post-selection strategy may lead to a useful quantum key generation rate for this system. This work represents the first quantitative assessment of continuous variable quantum key rates in the pragmatic scenario of reflection off low-earth-orbit satellites.

abstract: Experimental realization of a universal set of quantum logic gates is the central requirement for implementation of a quantum computer. An all-geometric approach to quantum computation offered a paradigm for implementation where all the quantum gates are achieved based on the Berry phases and their non-abelian extensions, the holonomies, from geometric transformation of quantum states in the Hilbert space. Apart from its fundamental interest and rich mathematical structure, the geometric approach has some built-in noise-resilient features. On the experimental side, geometric phases and holonomies have been observed using nuclear magnetic resonance with thermal ensembles of liquid molecules, however, such systems are known to be non-scalable for quantum computing. There are proposals to implement geometric quantum computation in scalable experimental platforms such as trapped ions, superconducting qubits, or quantum dots, and a recent experiment has realized geometric single-bit gates with the superconducting system. Here, we report the experimental realization of a universal set of geometric quantum gates with solid-state spins of the diamond defects. The diamond defects provide a scalable experimental platform with the potential for room-temperature quantum computing, which has attracted strong interest in recent years. Based on advance of coherent control in this system, our experiment shows that all-geometric and potentially robust quantum computation can be realized with solid-state spin qubits.

abstract: Quantum correlation lies at the very heart of almost all the non-classical phenomena exhibited by quantum systems composed of more than one subsystem. In the recent days it has been pointed out that there exists quantum correlation, namely discord which is more general than entanglement. Some authors have investigated that for certain initial states the quantum correlations as well as classical correlation exhibit sudden change under simple Markovian noise. We show that, this dy- namical behavior of the both types of correlations can be explained using the idea of complementary correlations introduced in [arXiv:1408.6851]. We also show that though certain class of mixed en- tangled states can resist the monotonic decay of quantum correlations,it is not true for all mixed states. Moreover, pure entangled states of two qubits will never exhibit such sudden change.

abstract: We present a novel quantum clock synchronization(QCS) scheme of multiple parties which uses operation as the trigger to start the evolution of the initial state, where existing QCS protocols use measurement to start the evolution. Since the trigger is the unitary operation, we have protected entanglement of remote nodes, and after concentration of the qubits to the center node, general measurements of the total state is possible. We show that our protocol links the QCS problem to a multiple phase estimation problem. We use the Fisher information to give the precision of the synchronization, and explicitly show that the Heisenberg scale of synchronization is achieved in the two party case. We also show that our protocol is very efficient in synchronizing a clock to the average time of other clocks. The precision has an $O(\sqrt{d})$ advantage of the precision of the average time's estimation over the best possible strategy using measurement triggered QCS. The precision is also Heisenberg scale.

abstract: Quantum entanglement is the most popular kind of quantum correlations, and its fundamental role in several tasks in quantum information theory like quantum cryptography, quantum dense coding, and quantum teleportation is undeniable. However, recent results suggest that various applications in quantum information theory do not require entanglement, and that their performance can be captured by a new type of quantum correlations which goes beyond entanglement. Quantum discord, introduced by Zurek more than a decade ago, is the most popular candidate for such general quantum correlations. In this work we give an introduction to this modern research direction. After a short review of the main concepts of quantum theory and entanglement, we present quantum discord and general quantum correlations, and discuss three applications which are based on this new type of correlations: remote state preparation, entanglement distribution, and transmission of correlations. We also give an outlook to other research in this direction.

abstract: We describe a general method for turning quantum circuits into sparse quantum subsystem codes. Using this prescription, we can map an arbitrary stabilizer code into a new subsystem code with the same distance and number of encoded qubits but where all the generators have constant weight, at the cost of adding some ancilla qubits. With an additional overhead of ancilla qubits, the new code can also be made spatially local. Applying our construction to certain concatenated stabilizer codes yields families of subsystem codes with constant-weight generators and with minimum distance $d = n^{1-\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon = O(1/\sqrt{\log n})$. For spatially local codes in $D$ dimensions we nearly saturate a bound due to Bravyi and Terhal and achieve $d = n^{1-\varepsilon-1/D}$. Previously the best code distance achievable with constant-weight generators in any dimension, due to Freedman, Meyer and Luo, was $O(\sqrt{n\log n})$ for a stabilizer code.

Arbitrary interactions are allowed between the (two) particles within one group. All other interactions are approximated by harmonic oscillator potentials. The problem is first reduced to an analytically solvable $N$-body problem and $N$ independent two-body problems. We calculate analytically spectra, wave functions, and normal modes for both the inverse square and delta-function two-body interactions. In particular, we calculate separation energies between two strings of particles. We find that the string separation energy increases with $N$ and interaction strength.

abstract: The interplay between non-Markovian dynamics and driving fields in the survival of entanglement between two non-degenerate oscillators is considered here. Based on exact analytical results for the non-Markovian dynamics of two parametrically coupled non-degenerate oscillators in contact to non-identical independent thermal baths, the out-of-equilibrium quantum limit derived in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 180501 (2010)] is generalized to the non-Markovian regime. Specifically, it is shown that non-Markovian dynamics, when compared to the Markovian case, allow for the survival of stationary entanglement at higher temperatures, with larger coupling strength to the baths and at smaller driving rates. The effect of the asymmetry of the (i) coupled oscillators, (ii) coupling strength to the baths at equal temperature and (iii) temperature at equal coupling strength is discussed.

abstract: Quantum particles with spin are the most elementary gyroscopes existing in nature. Can two such gyroscopes help two distant observers find out their relative orientation in space? Here we show that a single pair of gyroscopes in an EPR state gives little clue about the relative orientation, but when two or more EPR pairs are used in parallel, suddenly a common reference frame emerges, with an error that drops quickly with the size of the system, beating than the best classical scaling already for small number of copies. This activation phenomenon indicates the presence of a latent resource hidden into EPR correlations, which can be unlocked and turned into advantage when multiple copies are available.

abstract: We describe the interaction of two two-level atoms in free space with propagating modes of the quantized electromagnetic field, using the time-dependent Heisenberg-Langevin method. For single- photon pulses, we consider the effect of the pulse's spatial and temporal profiles on the atomic excitation. In particular, we find the ideal shape for a pulse to put exactly one excitation in any desired state of the bi-atomic system. Furthermore, we analyze the differences in the atomic dynamics between the cases of Fock state pulses and coherent state pulses.

abstract: We study pseudo PT symmetry for a tight binding lattice with a general form of the modulation. Using high-frequency Floquet method, we show that the critical non-Hermitian degree for the reality of the spectrum can be manipulated by varying the parameters of the modulation. We study the effect of periodical and quasi-periodical nature of the modulation on the pseudo PT symmetry.

abstract: The physical parameters governing the dynamics of a light emitting quantum system can be estimated from the photon counting signal. The information available in the full detection record can be analysed by means of the distribution of waiting times between detection events. Our theory allows calculation of the asymptotic, long time behaviour of the sensitivity limit, and it applies to emission processes with branching towards different final states accompanied by the emission of distinguishable photons. We illustrate the theory by application to a laser driven $\Lambda$-type atom.

abstract: Randomness is one of the most important resources in modern information science, since encryption founds upon the trust in random numbers. Since it is impossible to prove if an existing random bit string is truly random, it is relevant that they be generated in a trust worthy process. This requires specialized hardware for random numbers, for example a die or a tossed coin. But when all input parameters are known, their outcome might still be predicted. A quantum mechanical superposition allows for provably true random bit generation. In the past decade many quantum random number generators (QRNGs) were realized. A photonic implementation is described as a photon which impinges on a beam splitter, but such a protocol is rarely realized with non-classical light or anti-bunched single photons. Instead, laser sources or light emitting diodes are used. Here we analyze the difference in generating a true random bit string with a laser and with anti-bunched light. We show that a single photon source provides more randomness than even a brighter laser. This gain of usable entropy proves the advantages of true single photons versus coherent input states of light in an experimental implementation. The underlying advantage can be adapted to microscopy and sensing.

abstract: Wigner flow, quantum mechanics' phase space flow, reveals fine details of quantum dynamics -- finer than is ordinarily thought possible according to quantum folklore invoking Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Here, we study the features of Wigner flow of bound states of time-independent conservative, weakly anharmonic one-dimensional quantum-mechanical systems which are weakly excited. Only energy eigenstates and their pure two-state superpositions are considered. We focus on the simplest, most intuitive and analytically accessible aspects of Wigner flow. We stress connections between anharmonic cases and the well-studied harmonic case. We show that Wigner flow of weakly anharmonic potentials can be grouped into three distinct classes, associated with hard, soft, and odd potentials. It is shown that their Wigner flow patterns can be characterised by the flow's discrete stagnation points, how these arise and how a quantum system's dynamics is constrained by their topological charge conservation.

abstract: The ability to navigate light signals in two-dimensional networks of waveguide arrays is a prerequisite for the development of all-optical integrated circuits for information processing and networking. In this article, we present a theoretical analysis of bending losses in linear photonic lattices with engineered couplings, and discuss possible ways for their minimization. In contrast to previous work in the field, the lattices under consideration operate in the linear regime, in the sense that discrete solitons cannot exist. The present results suggest that the functionality of linear waveguide networks can be extended to operations that go beyond the recently demonstrated point-to-point transfer of signals, such as blocking, routing, logic functions, etc.

abstract: We devise and experimentally realize a procedure capable of detecting and distinguishing quantum discord and classical correlations as well the presence of factorized states in a joint system-environment setting. Our scheme builds on recent theoretical results showing how the distinguishability between two reduced states of a quantum system in a bipartite setting can convey important information about the correlations present in the bipartite state and the interaction between the subsystems. The two addressed subsystems are the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of the signal beam generated by parametric down-conversion, which are suitably prepared by the idler beam. Different global and local operations allow for the detection of different correlations by studying via state tomography the trace distance behavior between suitable polarization subsystem states.

abstract: In this paper I show starting from fundamental multiple scattering theory that negative refraction indices are feasible for matter wave systems. I give an explicit toy example in 1D for a system of scatterers that implies negative refraction of an incoming quantum wavepacket. I point out which features for the effective scattering field have to be considered. In addition I show that negative refraction indices allow perfect transmission of the wave by the ensemble of scatterers. Finally I suggest that the concept of the superlens, which is based on negative refraction, can be extended to matter waves.

abstract: In this paper we investigate the scalar Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect in two of its forms, i.e., its electric form and its gravitational form. The standard form of the electric AB effect involves having particles (such as electrons) move in regions with zero electric field but different electric potentials. When a particle is recombined with itself, it will have a different phase, which can show up as a change in the way the single particle interferes with itself when it is recombined with itself. In the case where one has quasi-static fields and potentials, the particle will invariably encounter fringing fields, which makes the theoretical and experimental status of the electric AB effect much less clear than that of the magnetic (or vector) AB effect. Here we propose using time varying fields outside of a spherical shell, and potentials inside a spherical shell to experimentally test the scalar AB effect. In our proposal a quantum system will always be in a field-free region but subjected to a non-zero time-varying potentials. Furthermore, our system will not be spatially split and brought back together as in the magnetic AB experiment. Therefore there is no spatial interference and hence no shift in a spatial interference pattern to observe. Rather, there arises purely temporal interference phenomena. As in the magnetic AB experiments, these effects are non-classical. We present two versions of this idea: (i) a Josephson temporal interferometry experiment inside a superconducting spherical shell with a time-varying surface charge; (ii) a two-level atom experiment in which the atomic spectrum acquires FM sidebands when it is placed inside a spherical shell whose exterior mass is sinusoidally varying with time. The former leads to a time-varying internal magnetic field, and the latter leads to a time-varying gravitational redshift.

abstract: We demonstrate the importance and utility of Monte Carlo simulation of single-photon detectors. Devising an optimal simulation is strongly influenced by the particular application because of the complexity of modern, avalanche-diode-based single-photon detectors.. Using a simple yet very demanding example of random number generation via detection of Poissonian photons exiting a beam splitter, we present a Monte Carlo simulation that faithfully reproduces the serial autocorrelation of random bits as a function of detection frequency over four orders of magnitude of the incident photon flux. We conjecture that this simulation approach can be easily modified for use in many other applications.

abstract: The free energy difference limits the amount of work that can be extracted on average using heat baths of fixed temperature from a system out of thermal equilibrium. This bound can be saturated by protocols putting the system and a bath into weak thermal contact (WTC), i.e., bringing the system into a Gibbs state at the bath's temperature. In this sense, WTC is universal for work extraction -- a notion that can be made precise in a variety of operational frameworks. In this work, we introduce the study of work-extraction protocols under restrictions encountered in realistic devices at the nano-scale. We consider limitations on the maximum energies in the system and on the local structure of many-body Hamiltonians. Remarkably, we find that WTC then loses its universality. We do so by proving a general bound for the extractable work in such restricted scenarios. This is used to prove a gap between the work the can be extracted with WTC and with more general operations. Our work highlights the relevance of operational frameworks such as those of thermal operations and Gibbs preserving maps, as they can improve the performance of thermal machines. Furthermore, it provides a unifying framework of incorporating natural restrictions in quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: A Lagrangian description is presented here that can be used in conjunction with a particle interpretation of quantum mechanics. The advantages of this description are that the field equations and the particle equations of motion can both be deduced from a single Lagrangian density expression and that conservation of energy and momentum are assured. This Lagrangian formulation is then applied to the special case of the well-known Bohm model as an example. It is thereby demonstrated that such a formulation is compatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics.

abstract: The modes of the electromagnetic field are solutions of Maxwell's equations taking into account the material boundary conditions. The field modes of classical optics - properly normalized - are also the mode functions of quantum optics. Quantum physics adds that the excitation within each mode is quantized in close analogy to the harmonic oscillator. A complete set of mode functions forms a basis with which any new modes can be reconstructed. In full generality each electromagnetic mode function in the four dimensional space-time is mathematically equivalent to a harmonic oscillator. The quantization of the electromagnetic field defines the excitation per mode and the correlation between modes. In classical optics there can be oscillations and stochastic fluctuations of amplitude, phase, polarization et cetera. In quantum optics there are in addition uncertain quantum field components, quantum correlations and quantized energies. Here, we present selected topics from classical to quantum optics. We start in the second chapter with the classical optics description of a light field and its spectral densities, their measurement and their interpretation. In the third chapter the quantum properties of a single light mode are reviewed as well as ways to measure these quantum properties. Gaussian states of a light mode are emphasized, i. e. states for which the Wigner function has a two dimensional Gaussian shape. The fourth chapter will be concerned with more than one mode presenting a unifying approach to quadratic Hamiltonians including phase conjugation which is related to time reversal.

abstract: For any bipartite state, how strongly can one subsystem be quantum correlated with another? Using the Koashi-Winter relation, we study the upper bound of purified quantum discord, which is given by the sum of the von Neumann entropy of the unmeasured subsystem and the entanglement of formation shared between the unmeasured subsystem with the environment. In particular, we find that the Luo et al.'s conjecture on the quantum correlations and the Lindblad conjecture are all ture, when the entanglement of formation vanishes. Let the difference between the left discord and the right discord be captured by the discord distance. If the Lindblad conjecture is true, we show that the joint entropy is a tight upper bound for the discord distance. Further, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for saturating upper bounds of purified quantum discord and discord distance separately with the equality conditions for the Araki-Lieb inequality and the Lindblad conjecture. Furthermore, we show that the subadditive relation holds for any bipartite quantum discord.

abstract: The quantum properties of dynamic correlations in a system of an electron spin surrounded by nuclear spins under the conditions of free induction decay (FID) and spin echo have been studied. Analytical results for the time evolution of mutual information, classical part of correlations, and quantum part characterized by quantum discord have been obtained within the central spin model in the high-temperature approximation. The same formulas describe the quantum discord in both the FID and the spin echo although the forms of the dependences are different because of difference in the parameters entering into the formulas. Discord of the spin echo compared with the FID has a strong dependence on time at short times, and it tends to zero with decreasing of the magnetic field, whereas in the case of the FID it reaches a plateau.

Explicit formulae up to the second order are derived for illustration, and a few comments on their consequences are added.

abstract: A Ramsey-type interferometer is suggested, employing a cold trapped ion and two time-delayed off-resonant femtosecond laser pulses. The laser light couples to the molecular polarization anisotropy, inducing rotational wavepacket dynamics. An interferogram is obtained from the delay dependent populations of the final field-free rotational states. Current experimental capabilities for cooling and preparation of the initial state are found to yield an interferogram visibility of more than 80\%. The interferograms can be used to determine the polarizability anisotropy with an accuracy of about $\pm 2\%$, respectively $\pm 5\%$, provided the uncertainty in the initial populations and measurement errors are confined to within the same limits.

abstract: Weak values, obtained from weak measurements, attempt to describe the properties of a quantum system as it evolves from an initial to a final state, without practically altering this evolution. Trajectories can be defined from weak measurements of the position, or inferred from weak values of the momentum operator. The former can be connected to the asymptotic form of the Feynman propagator and the latter to Bohmian trajectories. Employing a time-dependent oscillator as a model, this work analyzes to what extent weak measurements can shed light on the underlying dynamics of a quantum system expressed in terms of trajectories, in particular by comparing the two approaches.

abstract: Based on the measurement of quantum correlation functions, the quantum statistical properties of spectral measurements are studied for broadband radiation fields. The spectral filtering of light before its detection is compared with the direct detection followed by the spectral analysis of the recorded photocurrents. As an example, the squeezing spectra of the atomic resonance fluorescence are studied for both types of filtering procedures. The conditions for which the detection of the nonclassical signatures of the radiation is possible are analyzed. For the considered example, photocurrent filtering appears to be the superior option to detect nonclassicality, due to the vacuum-noise effects in the optical filtering.

abstract: Since the advent of quantum mechanics we have mainly been concerned with its predictions from the perspective of an external observer. This is in strong contrast to the theory of general relativity, where the physics is governed by the intrinsic properties of space-time. At the same time, the precise relation between space-time and quantum mechanics is still one of the greatest problems of theoretical physics. This immediately raises the question on the completeness of our understanding of quantum mechanics. Here we address the problem by making an intrinsic analysis of observables in generic quantum systems. We show that there is an extreme fine tuning problem for the emergence of physics from the Hilbert space dynamics. However, for any initial condition and Hamiltonian, there exists a special set of observables. We show that these observables are intimately linked to the natural configuration space in which an area law for the entanglement is inevitable. We argue that this implies emergent gravity.

abstract: We consider the general problem of estimating an unknown control parameter of an open quantum system. We establish a direct relation between the evolution of both system and environment and the precision with which the parameter can be estimated. We show that when the open quantum system undergoes a first-order dynamical phase transition the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which gives the upper bound on the achievable precision of any measurement of the system and environment, becomes quadratic in observation time (cf. "Heisenberg scaling"). In fact, the QFI is identical to the variance of the dynamical observable that characterises the phases that coexist at the transition, and enhanced scaling is a consequence of the divergence of the variance of this observable at the transition point. This identification allows to establish the finite time scaling of the QFI. Near the transition the QFI is quadratic in time for times shorter than the correlation time of the dynamics. In the regime of enhanced scaling the optimal measurement whose precision is given by the QFI involves measuring both system and output. As a particular realisation of these ideas, we describe a theoretical scheme for quantum enhanced phase estimation using the photons being emitted from a quantum system near the coexistence of dynamical phases with distinct photon emission rates.

abstract: Quantum manipulation of macroscopic mechanical systems is of great interest in both fundamental physics and applications ranging from high-precision metrology to quantum information processing. A crucial goal is to cool the mechanical system to its quantum ground state. In this review, we focus on the cavity optomechanical cooling, which exploits the cavity enhanced interaction between optical field and mechanical motion to reduce the thermal noise. Recent remarkable theoretical and experimental efforts in this field have taken a major step forward in preparing the motional quantum ground state of mesoscopic mechanical systems. This review first describes the quantum theory of cavity optomechanical cooling, including quantum noise approach and covariance approach; then the up-to-date experimental progresses are introduced. Finally, new cooling approaches are discussed along the directions of cooling in the strong coupling regime and cooling beyond the resolved sideband limit.

abstract: Dark and bright excitons are shown to appear naturally in a linear atomic super-lattice with two atoms per unit cell. In bringing the super-lattice into a strong coupling regime with a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide, bright excitons and photons are coherently mixed to form polaritons. Treating excitons as bosons implies a mechanism that forbids two excitations from being at the same atomic state, which is included here through a bosonization procedure with kinematic interactions. Interestingly these interactions couple dark and bright excitons, and which we exploit as a new tool for exciting dark states in a controllable way. We suggest a pump-probe experiment where two polaritons scatter into two dark excitons that found to be correlated and are represented as dark bogolon-excitons. The results can be adapted for any super-lattice of active materials, e.g., of organic molecules.

abstract: The study of entanglement between bosonic systems is of primary importance for establishing feasible resources needed for implementing quantum information protocols, both in their interacting atomic or photonic realizations. Atomic systems are particularly efficient in the production of large amounts of entanglement, providing higher information density than conventional qubit entangled states. Such increased quantum resources pave the way to novel fundamental tests of nature and efficient applications in quantum information, metrology and sensing. We consider a basic setup made up of two parties A and B, each one populated by a single level bosonic variable. The bosons are interacting and can hop between A and B, thus describing a two-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We consider the generation of quantum states in several situations that cover the majority of physical realizations: ground state, finite temperature, unitary dynamics, dissipation through dephasing and loss of particles. The system is analyzed through truncated exact diagonalization, as a function of the microscopic parameters. The non separability of the obtained quantum states is estimated by means of the negativity, which has recently been proven to be a suitable measure of entanglement. Finally, we calculate lower bounds of the entanglement of formation, an indicator that quantifies the minimal amount of entanglement resources needed to build up such states.

abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.

abstract: Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon in which a quantum state traverses energy barriers above the energy of the state itself. Tunneling has been hypothesized as an advantageous physical resource for optimization. Here we present the first experimental evidence of a computational role of multiqubit quantum tunneling in the evolution of a programmable quantum annealer. We develop a theoretical model based on a NIBA Quantum Master Equation to describe the multiqubit dissipative tunneling effects under the complex noise characteristics of such quantum devices. We start by considering a computational primitive, an optimization problem consisting of just one global and one false minimum. The quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global minimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum. In our study the non-convex potentials are realized by frustrated networks of qubit clusters with strong intra-cluster coupling. We show that the collective effect of the quantum environment is suppressed in the "critical" phase during the evolution where quantum tunneling "decides" the right path to solution. In a later stage dissipation facilitates the multiqubit tunneling leading to the solution state. The predictions of the model accurately describe the experimental data from the D-Wave Two quantum annealer at NASA Ames. In our computational primitive the temperature dependence of the probability of success in the quantum model is opposite to that of the classical paths with thermal hopping. Specifically, we provide an analysis of an optimization problem with sixteen qubits, demonstrating eight qubit tunneling that increases success probabilities. Furthermore, we report results for larger problems with up to 200 qubits that contain the primitive as subproblems.

abstract: As today's nanotechnology focus becomes primarily oriented toward production and manipulation of materials at the subatomic level, allowing the performance and complexity of interconnects where the device density accepts more than hundreds devices on a single chip, the manipulation of semiconductor nanostructures at the subatomic level sets its prime tasks on preserving and adequate transmission of information encoded in specified (quantum) states. The presented study employs the quantum communication protocol based on the hypergraph network model where the numerical solutions of equations of motion of quantum particles are associated to vertices (assembled with device chip), which follow specific controllable paths in the phase space. We address these findings towards ultimate quest for prediction and selective control of quantum particle trajectories. In addition, presented protocols could represent valuable tool for reducing background noise and uncertainty in low-dimensional and operationally meaningful, scalable complex systems.

abstract: We analyse the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering properties in a three-well Bose-Hubbard model under the mechanism of coherent transport of atomic population (CTAP). This process, also known as transport without transit (TWT), transfers condensed atoms from one well of a lattice potential to another, non-adjacent well, without macroscopic occupation of the middle well. The dynamics and entanglement properties of this system have previously been analysed and shown to be dependent on the initial quantum state of the atoms in the first well. In this work we utilise the phase-space method of stochastic integration in the positive-P representation. The system demonstrated inseparability between the wells for Fock initial states, and we show that steering is also only found for an initial Fock state. Depending on how we write our steering inequalities, steering is seen at different times, showing a basic asymmetry. This means that for part of the evolution, Alice can steer Bob but not vice versa. After the midpoint of the population transfer, this situation reverses.

abstract: In this paper we study the evolution of superoscillating initial data for the quantum driven harmonic oscillator. Our main result shows that superoscillations are amplified by the harmonic potential and that the analytic solution develops a singularity in finite time. We also show that for a large class of solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation, superoscillating behavior at any given time implies superoscillating behavior at any other time.

abstract: We discuss a problem of parameter estimation for quantum two-level system, qubit system, in presence of unknown phase parameter. We analyze trade-off relations for mean-square errors when estimating relevant parameters with separable measurements based on known precision bounds; the symmetric logarithmic derivative Cramer-Rao bound and Hayashi-Gill-Massar (HGM) bound. We investigate the optimal measurement which attains the HGM bound and discuss its properties. We show that the HGM bound for relevant parameters can be attained asymptotically by using some fraction of given $n$ quantum states to estimate the phase parameter. We also discuss the Holevo bound which can be attained asymptotically by a collective measurement.

abstract: Recently Bell-type inequalities were introduced in Phys. Rev. A \textbf{85}, 032119 (2012) to analyze the correlations emerging in an entanglement swapping scenario characterized by independence of the two sources shared between three parties. The corresponding scenario was referred to as \textit{bilocal} scenario. Here, we derive Bell-type inequalities in $n+1$ party scenario, i.e., in $n$-local scenario. Considering the two different cases with several number of inputs and outputs, we derive local and $n$-local bounds. The $n$-local inequality studied for two cases are proved to be tight. Replacing the sources by maximally entangled states for two binary inputs and two binary outputs and also for the fixed input and four outputs, we observe quantum violations of $n$-local bounds. But the resistance offered to noise cannot be increased as compared to the bilocal scenario. Thus increasing the number of parties in a linear fashion in source independent scenario does not contribute in lowering down the requirements of revealing quantumness in a network in contrast to the star configuration (Phys. Rev. A \textbf{90}, 062109 (2014)) of $n+1$ parties.

abstract: We show that universal holonomic quantum computation (HQC) can be achieved fault-tolerantly by adiabatically deforming the gapped stabilizer Hamiltonian of the surface code, where quantum information is encoded in the degenerate ground space of the system Hamiltonian. We explicitly propose procedures to perform each logical operation, including logical state initialization, logical state measurement, logical CNOT, state injection and distillation,etc. In particular, adiabatic braiding of different types of holes on the surface leads to a topologically protected, non-Abelian geometric logical CNOT. Throughout the computation, quantum information is protected from both small perturbations and low weight thermal excitations by a constant energy gap, and is independent of the system size. Also the Hamiltonian terms have weight at most four during the whole process. The effect of thermal error propagation is considered during the adiabatic code deformation. With the help of active error correction, this scheme is fault-tolerant, in the sense that the computation time can be arbitrarily long for large enough lattice size. It is shown that the frequency of error correction and the physical resources needed can be greatly reduced by the constant energy gap.

abstract: Time-bin entangled single-photons are highly demanded for long distance quantum communication. We propose a heralded source of tunable narrowband single photons entangled in well-separated multiple temporal modes (time bins) with controllable amplitudes. The detection of a single Stokes photon generated in a cold atomic ensemble via Raman scattering of a weak write pulse heralds the preparation of one spin excitation stored within the atomic medium. A train of read laser pulses deterministically converts the atomic excitation into a single anti-Stokes photon delocalized in multi-time-bins. The waveforms of bins are well-controlled by the read pulse parameters. A scheme to measure the phase coherence across all time bins is suggested.

abstract: We propose the notion of $E_{2}$-quasi-exact solvability and apply this idea to find explicit solutions to the eigenvalue problem for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian system depending on two parameters. The model considered reduces to the complex Mathieu Hamiltonian in a double scaling limit, which enables us to compute the exceptional points in the energy spectrum of the latter as a limiting process of the zeros for some algebraic equations. The coefficient functions in the quasi-exact eigenfunctions are univariate polynomials in the energy obeying a three-term recurrence relation. The latter property guarantees the existence of a linear functional such that the polynomials become orthogonal. The polynomials are shown to factorize for all levels above the quantization condition leading to vanishing norms rendering them to be weakly orthogonal. In two concrete examples we compute the explicit expressions for the Stieltjes measure.

I show that the joint distribution of any non-commuting pair of variables can be quantified via upper and lower probabilities, i.e. the joint probability is described by an interval instead of a number (imprecise probability). I propose transparent axioms from which the upper and lower probability operators follow. They depend only on the non-commuting observables and revert to the usual expression for the commuting case.

Also, we reveal relationship between quantum nonlocality and four-partite entanglement for four-qubit GGHZ states.

abstract: We show that the heating effect of spontaneous wave-function collapse models implies an experimentally significant increment $\Delta T$ of equilibrium temperature in a mechanical oscillator. The obtained form $\Delta T$ is linear in the oscillator's relaxation time $\tau$ and independent of the mass. The oscillator can be in a classical thermal state, the effect $\Delta T$ is classical for a wide range of frequencies and quality factors. We note that the test of $\Delta T$ does not necessitate quantum state monitoring but tomography. In both gravity-related (DP) and continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) models the strong-effect edge of their parameter range can be challenged in existing experiments on classical oscillators. For the CSL theory, the conjectured highest collapse rate parameter values become immediately constrained by evidences from current experiments on extreme slow-ring-down oscillators.

abstract: We present a sparse matrix permutation from graph theory that gives stable incomplete Lower-Upper (LU) preconditioners necessary for iterative solutions to the steady state density matrix for quantum optomechanical systems. This reordering is efficient, adding little overhead to the computation, and results in a marked reduction in both memory and runtime requirements compared to other solution methods, with performance gains increasing with system size. Either of these benchmarks can be tuned via the preconditioner accuracy and solution tolerance. This reordering optimizes the condition number of the approximate inverse, and is the only method found to be stable at large Hilbert space dimensions. This allows for steady state solutions to otherwise intractable quantum optomechanical systems.

abstract: The analytic structure of the S-matrix of singular quantum mechanics is examined within a multichannel framework, with primary focus on its dependence with respect to a parameter ($\Omega$) that determines the boundary conditions. Specifically, a characterization is given in terms of salient mathematical and physical properties governing its behavior. These properties involve unitarity and associated current-conserving Wronskian relations, time-reversal invariance, and Blaschke factorization. The approach leads to an interpretation of effective nonunitary solutions in singular quantum mechanics and their determination from the unitary family.

abstract: We show how one can be led from considerations of quantum steering to Bell's theorem. We begin with Einstein's demonstration that, assuming local realism, quantum states must be in a many-to-one ("incomplete") relationship with the real physical states of the system. We then consider some simple constraints that local realism imposes on any such incomplete model of physical reality, and show they are not satisfiable. In particular, we present a very simple demonstration for the absence of a local hidden variable incomplete description of nature by steering to two ensembles, one of which contains a pair of non-orthogonal states. Historically this is not how Bell's theorem arose - there are slight and subtle differences in the arguments - but it could have been.

abstract: In this work, we extensively study the problem of broadcasting of quantum correlations. This includes broadcasting of quantum entanglement as well as correlations that go beyond the notion of entanglement. It is quite well known from the "No-Broadcasting theorem" that perfect broadcasting of quantum correlation is not possible. However it does not rule out the possibility of partial broadcasting of correlations where we can get lesser correlated states from a given correlated state. In order to have a holistic view of broadcasting, we investigate this problem by starting with most general representation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the Bloch vectors. As a cloning transformation we have used universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery (B-H) cloner both locally and nonlocally. More specifically, we obtain a set of ranges in terms of Bloch vectors for which broadcasting of entanglement will be possible. In addition to the idea of broadcasting of entanglement for general two qubit mixed states, we explore broadcasting of quantum correlations that go beyond entanglement with the help of both local and nonlocal cloners. Remarkably, we find that it is impossible to even partially broadcast such correlations by using both local and nonlocal quantum copying machines. Taking two different types Buzek-Hillery quantum cloners (state dependent and state independent) we analytically prove the impossibility of even partial broadcasting of correlation. Lastly, we generalize this impossibility result for any symmetric or asymmetric cloning machines as well. This result brings out a fundamental difference between the correlation defined from the perspective of entanglement and the correlation measure which claims to go beyond entanglement.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: There are at least three different notions of degrees of freedom (DF) that are important in comparison of quantum and classical dynamical systems. One is related to the type of dynamical equations and inequivalent initial conditions, the other to the structure of the system and the third to the properties of dynamical orbits. In this paper, definitions and comparison in classical and quantum systems of the tree types of DF are formulated and discussed. In particular, we concentrate on comparison of the number of the so called dynamical DF in a quantum system and its classical model. The comparison involves analyzes of relations between integrability of the classical model, dynamical symmetry and separability of the quantum and the corresponding classical systems and dynamical generation of appropriately defined quantumness. The analyzes is conducted using illustrative typical systems. A conjecture summarizing the observed relation between generation of quantumness by the quantum dynamics and dynamical properties of the classical model is formulated.

abstract: Possibility of state cloning is analyzed in two types of generalizations of quantum mechanics with nonlinear evolution. It is first shown that nonlinear Hamiltonian quantum mechanics does not admit cloning without the cloning machine. It is then demonstrated that the addition of the cloning machine, treated as a quantum or as a classical system, makes the cloning possible by nonlinear Hamiltonian evolution. However, a special type of quantum-classical theory, known as the mean-field Hamiltonian hybrid mechanics, does not admit cloning by natural evolution. The latter represents an example of a theory where it appears to be possible to communicate between two quantum systems at super-luminal speed, but at the same time it is impossible to clone quantum pure states.

abstract: The Casimir force between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates is considered. In a recent paper we presented generalised physical boundary conditions describing perfectly reflecting parallel plates. These boundary conditions are applicable to a field possessing any spin, and include the well-known spin-1/2 and spin-1 boundary conditions as special cases. Here we use these general boundary conditions to show that the allowed values of energy-momentum turn out to be the same for any massless fermionic field and the same for any massless bosonic field. As a result one expects to obtain only two possible Casimir forces, one associated with fermions and the other with bosons. We explicitly verify that this is the case for the fields up to spin-2. A significant implication of our work is that periodic boundary conditions cannot be applied to a fermionic field confined between two parallel plates.

Any information stored in a quantum field will inevitably be destroyed by an unknown Bogolyubov transformation relating the observers. However certain quantum correlations between different, independent fields will be preserved, no matter what transformation is applied. We show how to efficiently use these correlations in communication between arbitrary observers.

abstract: The observation of the non-local properties of multipartite entangled states is of great importance for quantum information protocols. Such properties, however, are fragile and may not be observed in the presence of decoherence exhibited by practical physical systems. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the non-locality of symmetric states experiencing phase and amplitude damping, using suitable Bell inequalities based on an extended version of Hardy's paradox. We derive thresholds for observing non-locality in terms of experimental noise parameters, and demonstrate the importance of the choice of the measurement bases for optimizing the robustness. For $W$ states, in the phase damping case, we show that this choice can lead to a trade-off between obtaining a high violation of the non-local test and optimal robustness thresholds; we also show that in this setting the non-locality of $W$ states is particularly robust for a large number of qubits. Furthermore, we apply our techniques to the discrimination of symmetric states belonging to different entanglement classes, thus illustrating their usefulness for a wide range of practical quantum information applications.

abstract: The generation of random numbers via quantum processes is an efficient and reliable method to obtain true indeterministic random numbers that are of vital importance to cryptographic communication and large-scale computer modeling. However, in realistic scenarios, the raw output of a quantum random-number generator is inevitably tainted by classical technical noise. The integrity of the device can be compromised if this noise is tampered with, or even controlled by some malicious party. To safeguard against this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach that produces side-information independent randomness that is quantified by min-entropy conditioned on this classical noise. We present a method for maximizing the conditional min-entropy of the number sequence generated from a given quantum-to-classical-noise ratio. The detected photocurrent in our experiment is shown to have a real-time random-number generation rate of 14 (Mbit/s)/MHz. The spectral response of the detection system shows the potential to deliver more than 70 Gbit/s of random numbers in our experimental setup.

abstract: The collective dynamics of mobile scatterers and light in optical resonators generates complex behaviour. For strong transverse illumination a phase transition from homogeneous to crystalline particle order appears. In contrast, a gas inside a single-side pumped ring cavity exhibits an instability towards bunching and collective acceleration called collective atomic recoil lasing (CARL). We demonstrate that by driving two orthogonally polarized counter propagating modes of a ring resonator one realises both cases within one system. The corresponding phase diagram depending on the two pump intensities exhibits regions in which either a generalized form of self-ordering towards a travelling density wave with constant centre of mass velocity or a CARL instability is formed. Controlling the cavity driving then allows to accelerate or slow down and trap a sufficiently dense beam of linearly polarizable particles.

abstract: We formulate a method allowing to confirm or exclude the alternative models of material properties at some definite confidence level in experiments on measuring the Casimir force. The method is based on the consideration of differences between the theoretical and mean measured quantities and the confidence intervals for these differences found at sufficiently high or low confidence probabilities. The developed method is applied to the data of four recent experiments on measuring the gradient of the Casimir force by means of a dynamic atomic force microscope. It is shown that in experiments with Au-Au and Ni-Ni test bodies, where the Drude model approach is excluded at a 95% confidence level, the plasma model approach agrees with the data at higher than 90% confidence. In experiments using an Au sphere interacting with either a Ni plate or a graphene-coated substrate the measurement data agree with the common prediction of the Drude and plasma model approaches and theory using the polarization tensor at 90% and 80% confidence levels, respectively.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4578
abstract: The stability of dynamical systems against perturbations (variations in initial conditions/model parameters) is a property referred to as structural stability. The study of sensitivity to perturbation is essential because in experiment initial conditions are not fixed, nor are model parameters known, to arbitrarily high precision. Additionally, if a physical system under study exhibits stability (insensitivity to initial conditions) then a theoretical description of the system must exhibit structural stability. Consequently, stability can be a useful indicator of the correctness of a theoretical formulation. In this work the many-worlds interpretation is considered. It is first demonstrated that the interpretation admits a class of special states, herein referred to as "quantum liar states," because they indicate disagreement between the recorded result of a measurement and the actual state of a system. It is then demonstrated that the many-worlds interpretation is not structurally stable against the introduction of quantum liar states.

abstract: Algorithmic cooling is a method that employs thermalization to increase the qubits' purification level, namely it reduces the qubit-system's entropy. We utilized gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), an optimal control algorithm, to implement algorithmic cooling in liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance. Various cooling algorithms were applied onto the three qubits of 13C2-trichloroethylene, cooling the system beyond Shannon's entropy bound in several different ways. For example, in one experiment a carbon qubit was cooled by a factor of 4.61. This work is a step towards potentially integrating tools of NMR quantum computing into in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

abstract: Bell's Theorem shows that quantum mechanical correlations can violate the constraints that the causal structure of certain experiments impose on any classical explanation. It is thus natural to ask to which degree the causal assumptions -- e.g. locality or measurement independence -- have to be relaxed in order to allow for a classical description of such experiments. Here, we develop a conceptual and computational framework for treating this problem. We employ the language of Bayesian networks to systematically construct alternative causal structures and bound the degree of relaxation using quantitative measures that originate from the mathematical theory of causality. The main technical insight is that the resulting problems can often be expressed as computationally tractable linear programs. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by applying it to a variety of scenarios, ranging from relaxations of the measurement independence, locality and bilocality assumptions, to a novel causal interpretation of CHSH inequality violations.

abstract: The generation of (Bell-)nonlocal correlations, i.e., correlations leading to the violation of a Bell-like inequality, requires the usage of a nonlocal resource, such as an entangled state. When given a correlation (a collection of conditional probability distributions) from an experiment or from a theory, it is desirable to determine the extent to which the participating parties would need to collaborate nonlocally for its (re)production. Here, we propose to achieve this via the minimal group size (MGS) of the resource, i.e., the smallest number of parties that need to share a given type of nonlocal resource for the above-mentioned purpose. In addition, we provide a general recipe --- based on the lifting of Bell-like inequalities --- to construct MGS witnesses for non-signaling resources starting from any given ones. En route to illustrating the applicability of this recipe, we also show that when restricted to the space of full-correlation functions, non-signaling resources are as powerful as unconstrained signaling resources. Explicit examples of correlations where their MGS can be determined using this recipe and other numerical techniques are provided.

abstract: We show that expectation value of squared correlations measured along random local directions is a quantifier of quantum entanglement in pure states which can be directly experimentally assessed by a measurement on two copies of the state. Entanglement can therefore be measured by parties who do not share a common reference frame and do not even possess a well-defined local reference frame. We show that already a single-qubit-per-party reference and rotationally invariant measurements are sufficient to quantify entanglement and violate a Bell inequality. We also provide an entanglement witness solely in terms of random correlations, capable of detecting entanglement in mixed states, and emphasise how data gathered for a single measurement setting reliably detects entanglement.

abstract: Light transport in a dense and disordered cold atomic ensemble, where the cooperation of atomic dipoles essentially modifies their coupling with the radiation modes, offers an alternative approach to light-matter interfacing protocols. Here, we show how the cooperativity and quasi-static dipole interaction affect the process of light propagation under the conditions of electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). We perform comparative analysis of the self-consistent approach with ab-initio microscopic calculations and emphasize the role of the interatomic interaction in the dipoles' dynamics. Our results show that in such a dense and strongly disordered system the EIT-based light storage protocol stays relatively insensitive to configuration variations and can be obtained with essentially less atoms than it is normally needed for dilute configurations.

abstract: Blind quantum computation allows a user to delegate a computation to an untrusted server while keeping the computation hidden. A number of recent works have sought to establish bounds on the communication requirements necessary to implement blind computation, and a bound based on the no-programming theorem of Nielsen and Chuang has emerged as a natural limiting factor. Here we show that this constraints only hold in limited scenarios and show how to overcome it using a method based on iterated gate-teleportations. We present our results as a family of protocols, with varying degrees of computational-ability requirements on the client. Certain protocols in this family exponentially outperform previously known schemes in terms of total communication. The approach presented here can be adapted to other distributed computing protocols to reduce communication requirements.

abstract: Experimental violations of Bell inequalities are in general vulnerable to so-called "loopholes." A loophole-free Bell test, closing all major loopholes simultaneously in a single experiment, is still an outstanding goal in the community. In this work, we analyse the characteristics of a definitive Bell test, closing simultaneously the locality, freedom-of-choice, fair-sampling (i.e. detection), coincidence-time, and memory loophole. We focus in particular on non-ideal random number generators for the setting choices. Due to their finite autocorrelation, such devices allow a certain predictability. We discuss a necessary adaptation of the CH/Eberhard inequality bound when using such imperfect devices, the role of bias in the setting choices, and -- using Hoeffding's inequality and Doob's optional stopping theorem -- the run time for a statistically significant Bell test.

abstract: We extend the quantum jump method to nearly adiabatically driven open quantum systems in a way that allows for an accurate account of the external driving in the system-environment interaction. Using this framework, we construct the corresponding trajectory-dependent work performed on the system and derive the integral fluctuation theorem and the Jarzynski equality for nearly adiabatic driving. We show that such identities hold as long as the stochastic dynamics and work variable are consistently defined. We numerically study the emerging work statistics for a two-level quantum system and find that the conventional diabatic approximation is unable to capture some prominent features arising from driving such as the continuity of the probability density of work. Our results reveal the necessity of using accurate expressions for the drive-dressed heat exchange in future experiments probing jump time distributions.

We discuss the difficulties that we found in the analysis of the main equations and results. We conclude that the eigenvalues reported by the authors do not exhibit the same order as those of the Hellmann potential thus leading to a different underlying physics. What is more: the spectrum of the modified model is qualitatively different from the one supported by the Hellmann potential.

abstract: Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive in which Alice wishes to commit a secret bit to Bob. Perfectly secure bit commitment between two mistrustful parties is impossible through asynchronous exchange of quantum information. Perfect security is however possible when Alice and Bob each split into several agents exchanging classical information at times and locations suitably chosen to satisfy specific relativistic constraints. In this Letter we first revisit a previously proposed scheme that realizes bit commitment using only classical communication. We prove that the protocol is secure against quantum adversaries for a duration limited by the light-speed communication time between the locations of the agents. We then propose a novel multi-round scheme based on finite-field arithmetic that extends the commitment time beyond this limit, and we prove its security against classical attacks. Finally, we present an implementation of these protocols using dedicated hardware and we show how it could be used to realize commitments of duration ranging up to 212 milliseconds by agents occupying antipodal locations on the Earth.

abstract: We give two strengthenings of an inequality for the quantum conditional mutual information of a tripartite quantum state recently proved by Fawzi and Renner, connecting it with the ability to reconstruct the state from its bipartite reductions. Namely we show that the conditional mutual information is an upper bound on the regularised relative entropy distance between the quantum state and its reconstructed version. It is also an upper bound for the measured relative entropy distance of the state to its reconstructed version. The main ingredient of the proof is the fact that the conditional mutual information is the optimal quantum communication rate in the task of state redistribution.

abstract: Ion Coulomb crystals (ICC), formed by atomic ions at low temperatures in radiofrequency and Penning ion traps, are structures that have remarkable properties and many applications. Images of Coulomb crystals are striking and reveal the crystal structure, which arises from a balance between the trapping forces acting on the ions and their mutual Coulomb repulsion. Applications of these structures range from frequency standards and quantum simulation through to measurement of the cross sections of chemical reactions of ions.

abstract: High-fidelity measurements are important for the physical implementation of quantum information protocols. Current methods for classifying measurement trajectories in superconducting qubit systems produce fidelities that are systematically lower than those predicted by experimental parameters. Here, we place current classification methods within the framework of machine learning algorithms and improve on them by investigating more sophisticated ML approaches. We find that non-linear algorithms and clustering methods produce significantly higher assignment fidelities that help close the gap to the fidelity achievable under ideal noise conditions. Clustering methods group trajectories into natural subsets within the data, which allows for the diagnosis of specific systematic errors. We find large clusters in the data associated with relaxation processes and show these are the main source of discrepancy between our experimental and achievable fidelities. These error diagnosis techniques help provide a concrete path forward to improve qubit measurements.

We find that electron emission from the core level band is delayed by $\Delta \tau =100$ attoseconds relative to the release of electrons from the valence band. We show that this relative time offset in electron emission is caused by the screening of the streaking laser field by conduction electrons.

abstract: The spinor representation of spin-1/2 states can equally well be mapped to a single unit quaternion, yielding a new perspective despite the equivalent mathematics. This paper first demonstrates a useable map that allows Bloch-sphere rotations to be represented as quaternionic multiplications, simplifying the form of the dynamical equations. Left-multiplications generally correspond to non-unitary transformations, providing a simpler (essentially classical) analysis of time-reversal. But the quaternion viewpoint also reveals a surprisingly large broken symmetry, as well as a potential way to restore it, via a natural expansion of the state space that has parallels to second order fermions. This expansion to "second order qubits" would imply either a larger gauge freedom or a natural space of hidden variables.

abstract: A solvable anharmonic oscillator is presumably simulable by a classical computer and therefore by a quantum computer. An anharmonic oscillator whose Hamiltonian is of normal type and quartic in the canonical coordinates is not quantizable. If, as argued here, quantum simulation of a classical physical system entails quantization of that system, then either there exist nonsimulable, solvable anharmonic oscillators or there are no obstructions to simulation-based quantization.

Here, using spontaneous parametric downconversion as a heralded single-photon source, we place experimental limits on a class of alternative theories, consisting of classical field theories which result in power-dependent normalized correlation functions. In addition, we compare our results with standard quantum mechanical interpretations of our spontaneous parametric downconversion source over an order of magnitude in intensity. Our data match the quantum mechanical expectations, and do not show a statistically significant dependence on power, limiting on quantum mechanics alternatives which require power-dependent autocorrelation functions.

abstract: We present a strategy for implementing multiparty-controlled remote state preparation (MCRSP) for a family of four-qubit cluster-type states with genuine entanglements while employing, Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger-class states as quantum channels. In this scenario, the encoded information is transmitted from the sender to a spatially separated receiver via the control of multi-party. Predicated on the collaboration of all participants, the desired state can be entirely restored within the receiver's place with high success probability by application of appropriate local operations and necessary classical communication . Moreover, this proposal for MCRSP can be faithfully achieved with unit total success probability when the quantum channels are distilled to maximally entangled ones.

abstract: In any measurement of a parameter, effect of finite resource is manifested in a finite number ($M$) of probable values for the estimate. Here it is shown that this count of the discrete number of measurement outcomes leads to a pair of equivalent bounds:$\delta \geq 1/M$ on precision($\delta$) and $I \leq \log(M)$ on \textit{mutual information} ($I$) between the parameter and its estimate. Furthermore, the probe particle symmetry is found to play a significant role in limiting $M$ and thereby, in limiting extractable information in a measurement. In particular, for $N$ indistinguishable spin-half probe particles, it is shown that $M$ is tightly bounded to $O(N^2)$. The corresponding operator that saturates this bound represents a non interferometric measurement. While inherently Heisenberg limited, this measurement is precise up to $\delta \sim 1/N^2$. These results can be used to benchmark any precision measurement thereby establishing a particular link between information theory and metrology.

abstract: Although a universal quantum computer is still far from reach, the tremendous advances in controllable quantum devices, in particular with solid-state systems, make it possible to physically implement "quantum simulators". Quantum simulators are physical setups able to simulate other quantum systems efficiently that are intractable on classical computers. Based on solid-state qubit systems with various types of nearest-neighbor interactions, we propose a complete set of algorithms for simulating pairing Hamiltonians. Fidelity of the target states corresponding to each algorithm is numerically studied. We also compare algorithms designed for different types of experimentally available Hamiltonians and analyze their complexity. Furthermore, we design a measurement scheme to extract energy spectra from the simulators. Our simulation algorithms might be feasible with state-of-the-art technology in solid-state quantum devices.

abstract: Information recycling has been shown to improve the sensitivity of atom interferometers by exploiting atom-light entanglement. In this paper, we apply information recycling to an interferometer where the input quantum state has been partially transferred from some donor system. We demonstrate that when the quantum state of this donor system is from a particular class of number-correlated Heisenberg-limited states, information recycling yields a Heisenberg-limited phase measurement. Crucially, this result holds irrespective of the fraction of the quantum state transferred to the interferometer input and also for a general class of number-conserving quantum-state-transfer processes, including ones that destroy the first-order phase coherence between the branches of the interferometer. This result could have significant applications in Heisenberg-limited atom interferometry, where the quantum state is transferred from a Heisenberg-limited photon source, and in optical interferometry where the loss can be monitored.

Our work shows that the atomic spontaneous emission, cavity decay, and even the fiber loss, which are the three main dissipative factors in the atom-cavity-fibre system, could be used to prepare entanglement, respectively and simultaneously. Originating from an arbitrary state, the desired state could be prepared without precise time control. The robustness of the scheme is numerically demonstrated by considering various parameters.

The case of positive energy levels, known as meta-stable states, is also discussed and the magnitude of transmission coefficient through the potential barrier is evaluated.

abstract: Advancements in physics are often motivated/accompanied by advancements in our precision measurements abilities. The current generation of atomic and optical interferometers is limited by shot noise, a fundamental limit when estimating a phase shift with classical light or uncorrelated atoms. In the last years, it has been clarified that the creation of special quantum correlations among particles, which will be called here useful entanglement, can strongly enhance the interferometric sensitivity. Pioneer experiments have already demonstrated the basic principles. We are probably at the verge of a second quantum revolution where quantum mechanics of many-body systems is exploited to overcome the limitations of classical technologies. This review illustrates the deep connection between entanglement and sub shot noise sensitivity.

abstract: Encryption schemes often derive their power from the properties of the underlying algebra on the symbols used. Inspired by group theoretic tools, we use the centralizer of a subgroup of operations to present a private-key quantum homomorphic encryption scheme that enables a broad class of quantum computation on encrypted data. A particular instance of our encoding hides up to a constant fraction of the information encrypted. This fraction can be made arbitrarily close to unity with overhead scaling only polynomially in the message length. This highlights the potential of our protocol to hide a non-trivial amount of information, and is suggestive of a large class of encodings that might yield better security.

abstract: We obtain exact solutions of the (2+1) dimensional Dirac oscillator in a homogeneous magnetic field within a minimal length ($\Delta x_0=\hbar \sqrt{\beta}$), or generalised uncertainty principle (GUP) scenario. This system in ordinary quantum mechanics has a single left-right chiral quantum phase transition (QPT). We show that a non zero minimal length turns on a infinite number of quantum phase transitions which accumulate towards the known QPT when $\beta \to 0$. It is also shown that the presence of the minimal length modifies the degeneracy of the states and that in this case there exist a new class of states which do not survive in the ordinary quantum mechanics limit $\beta \to 0$.

abstract: It is important that any dynamics method approaches the correct population distribution at long times. In this paper, we derive a one-body reduced density matrix dynamics for electrons in energetic contact with a bath. We obtain a remarkable equation of motion which shows that in order to reach equilibrium properly, rates of electron transitions depend on the density matrix. Even though the bath drives the electrons towards a Boltzmann distribution, hole blocking factors in our equation of motion cause the electronic populations to relax to a Fermi-Dirac distribution. These factors are an old concept, but we show how they can be derived with a combination of time-dependent perturbation theory, and the extended normal ordering of Mukherjee and Kutzelnigg. The resulting non-equilibrium kinetic equations generalize the usual Redfield theory to many-electron systems, while ensuring that the orbital occupations remain between zero and one. In numerical applications of our equations, we show that relaxation rates of molecules are not constant because of the blocking effect. Other applications to model atomic chains are also presented which highlight the importance of treating both dephasing and relaxation. Finally we show how the bath localizes the electron density matrix.

abstract: Coherent control of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond's triplet spin state has traditionally been accomplished with resonant ac magnetic fields under the constraint of the magnetic dipole selection rule, which forbids direct control of the $|-1>\leftrightarrow |+1>$ spin transition. We show that high-frequency stress resonant with the spin state splitting can coherently control NV center spins within this subspace. Using a bulk-mode mechanical microresonator fabricated from single-crystal diamond, we apply intense ac stress to the diamond substrate and observe mechanically driven Rabi oscillations between the $|-1>$ and $|+1>$ states of an NV center spin ensemble. Additionally, we measure the inhomogeneous spin dephasing time ($T_{2}^{*}$) of the spin ensemble using a mechanical Ramsey sequence and compare it to the dephasing times measured with a magnetic Ramsey sequence for each of the three spin qubit combinations available within the NV center ground state. These results demonstrate coherent spin driving with a mechanical resonator and could enable the creation of a phase-sensitive $\Delta$-system within the NV center ground state.

abstract: We consider the zero-point field fluctuations, and the related field energy densities, inside a one-dimensional and a three-dimensional cavity with a mobile wall. The mechanical degrees of freedom of the mobile wall are described quantum mechanically and they are fully included in the overall system dynamics. In this optomechanical system, the field and the wall can interact with each other through the radiation pressure on the wall, given by the photons inside the cavity or even by vacuum fluctuations. We consider two cases: the one-dimensional electromagnetic field and the three-dimensional scalar field, and use the Green's functions formalism, which allows extension of the results obtained for the scalar field to the electromagnetic field. We show that the quantum fluctuations of the position of the cavity's mobile wall significantly affect the field energy density inside the cavity, in particular at the very proximity of the mobile wall. The dependence of this effect from the ultraviolet cutoff frequency, related to the plasma frequency of the cavity walls, is discussed. We also compare our new results for the one-dimensional electromagnetic field and the three-dimensional massless scalar field to results recently obtained for the one-dimensional massless scalar field. We show that the presence of a mobile wall also changes the Casimir-Polder force on a polarizable body placed inside the cavity, giving the possibility to detect experimentally the new effects we have considered.

abstract: A number of recent controversial experiments have observed anomalous thrust forces with devices making use of electromagnetic fields, and which do not appear to emit any particles or radiation; in apparent violation of the principle of the conservation of momentum. This has led to proposals that the measured forces are being produced due to an interaction between the applied electromagnetic fields of the device, and virtual particles/anti-particles of the quantum vacuum. Using an argument based on Lorentz invariance, as well as a formal quantum field theoretic calculation, we investigate the feasibility of these proposals. We find that both the vacuum expectation value of the linear momentum operator (the zero-point momentum), as well as the conserved current, are both exactly zero; the quantum vacuum does not appear to be a viable reaction medium with which to generate thrust.

We exploit correlation tensor norms to develop a framework for its experimental detection without the need for shared frames of reference. By bounding these norms for partially separable states and states of limited dimension we achieve an extensive characterization of entanglement in multipartite systems in an experimentally feasible way. Furthermore we show that both bi- and multipartite dimensionality of entanglement can be revealed by our methods.

abstract: By Lyapunov control, we present a proposal to drive quasiparticles into a topological mode in quantum systems described by quadratic Hamiltonian. The merit of this control strategy is that only manipulation of the boundary sites are required, and the proposal works for both Fermi and Bose systems. We take the Kitaev's chain as an illustration for Fermi system and show that by manipulating the chemical potential of the boundary sites, we can steer an arbitrary excitation mode into the Majorana zero mode. For Bose system, taking the noninteracting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, we illustrate how to drive the system into the edge mode, i.e., the mode localized at the boundary sites. Finally, we explore the possibility to replace the continuous control field by square wave pulses.

abstract: The resonator-induced phase gate is a multi-qubit controlled-phase gate for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits. Through off-resonant driving of a bus resonator, statically coupled qubits acquire a state-dependent phase. However, photon loss leads to dephasing during the gate, and any residual entanglement between the resonator and qubits after the gate leads to decoherence. Here we consider how to shape the drive pulse to minimize these unwanted effects. First, we review how the gate's entangling and dephasing rates depend on the system parameters and validate closed-form solutions against direct numerical solution of a master equation. Next, we propose spline pulse shapes that reduce residual qubit-bus entanglement, are robust to imprecise knowledge of the resonator shift, and can be shortened by using higher-degree polynomials. Finally, we present a procedure that optimizes over the subspace of pulses that leave the resonator unpopulated. This finds shaped drive pulses that further reduce the gate duration. Assuming realistic parameters, we exhibit shaped pulses that have the potential to realize ~212 ns spline pulse gates and ~120 ns optimized gates with ~6e-4 average gate infidelity. These examples do not represent fundamental limits of the gate and in principle even shorter gates may be achievable.

abstract: A new entangled quantum state is introduced by applying local coherent superposition (ra^+ +ta) of photon subtraction and addition to each mode of even entangled coherent state (EECS) and the properties of entanglement are investigated. It is found that the Shchukin-Vogel inseparability, the degree of entanglement and the average fidelity of quantum teleportation of the EECS can be improved due to the coherent superposition operation. The effects of improvement by coherent superposition operation are better than those by single (a^+) and two-photon (a^+ b^+) addition operations under a small region of amplitude.

abstract: A complete apparatus is defined as reacting to every state of the measured system. Standard quantum mechanics of indistinguishable particles is shown to imply that apparatuses must be incomplete or else they would be drowned out by noise. Each quantum observable is then an abstract representation of many measurement apparatuses. Moreover, the measured systems must be prepared in a state that is sufficiently different from the states of particles in the environment. This is the main purpose of preparations. A system so prepared was said to have a "separation status". A new, more satisfactory definition of separations status is given than that proposed in previous papers. Conditions are specified under which the particles in the environment may be ignored as is usually done in the theory of measurement.

abstract: Neutrino oscillations provide evidence for the mode entanglement of neutrino mass eigenstates in a given flavour eigenstate. Given this mode entanglement, it is pertinent to ask if other quantum correlations are present in neutrino evolution. In this study, we compute a number of such correlations for accelerator neutrinos in the approximation of two flavour nu_{mu} <--> nu_{tau} oscillations. The point of minimum survival probability corresponds to the extremum point of all measures of quantum correlations. We find that Bell's inequality is always violated.

abstract: Quantum data is susceptible to decoherence induced by the environment and to errors in the hardware processing it. A future fault-tolerant quantum computer will use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In the smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a two-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits. For each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed stabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing the encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and NV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at the end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable to physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for fault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the two parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit repetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We construct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using ancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating three-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate stabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to coherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits. While increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are required to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a critical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements.

abstract: We generalize the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) to dissipative systems using Monte Carlo methods, allowing the application of existing variational classes for pure states, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), to the simulation of Lindblad master equation dynamics. The key step is to use sampling to approximately solve the Fokker-Planck equation derived from the Lindblad generators. An important computational advantage of this method, compared to other variational approaches to mixed state dynamics, is that it is "embarrassingly parallel".

abstract: We study the dynamics of heat flux in the thermalization process of a pair of identical quantum system that interact dissipatively with a reservoir in a {\it cascaded} fashion. Despite the open dynamics of the bipartite system S is globally Lindbladian, one of the subsystems "sees" the reservoir in a state modified by the interaction with the other subsystem and hence it undergoes a non-Markovian dynamics. As a consequence, the heat flow exhibits a non-exponential time behaviour which can greatly deviate from the case where each party is independently coupled to the reservoir. We investigate both thermal and correlated initial states of $S$ and show that the presence of correlations at the beginning can considerably affect the heat flux rate. We carry out our study in two paradigmatic cases -- a pair of harmonic oscillators with a reservoir of bosonic modes and two qubits with a reservoir of fermionic modes -- and compare the corresponding behaviours. In the case of qubits and for initial thermal states, we find that the trace distance discord is at any time interpretable as the correlated contribution to the total heat flux.

abstract: Spectral components of continuous squeezed fields are entangled. In this article we review and clarify this phenomenon by analyzing systematically the relations between the correlations of modes filtered from stationary continuous fields and the cross power spectrum between the operators of the corresponding spectral components. Moreover, we study the specific spectral components that are filtered in homodyne or heterodyne detections and their entanglement properties. In particular, we establish the equivalence between two-mode squeezing variance and logarithmic negativity for the spectral components of continuous stationary fields, thereby demonstrating that the measurement of the homodyne or heterodyne spectrum is, in fact, a direct measurement of the logarithmic negativity between specific spectral modes. As an illustrative example, we apply these concepts to the analysis of entanglement in ponderomotive squeezing.

abstract: We investigate theoretically how the spectroscopy of an ancillary qubit can probe cavity (circuit) QED ground states containing photons. We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.

abstract: It is well known that string theory generates the idea of higher dimensional spacetime instead of the (3+1) dimensions, in which we seem to live. It indicates that the extra space dimensions may remain curled up into very small space. In this paper, we study quantum mechanical scattering in presence of extra compact space dimension in the hope of devising a method to get a clue to the presence of extra space dimension. We consider a simplified model of scattering, in which a beam of free particles is scattered due to a one dimensional Dirac-delta potential in presence of an extra compact space dimension. We find that the incident, reflected and transmitted probability current densities of the particles contain the information of the extra dimension. Thus, by measuring experimentally the reflected and transmitted probability current densities of the particles, we may confirm the presence of extra dimension. We also show that the idea of compactification of the extra dimensions gives rise to the quantization of the energy values of the free particles. So, by measuring the quantized energy values of the scattered free particles, we may again confirm the presence of extra dimensions. We also discuss briefly, how the extra compact space dimensions can be detected if the scattering process is performed in (9+1) dimensions, in which six space dimensions are compact.

abstract: In this review we consider the performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm for the solution of decision problems. We divide the possible failure mechanisms into two sets: small gaps due to quantum phase transitions and small gaps due to avoided crossings inside a phase. We argue that the thermodynamic order of the phase transitions is not predictive of the scaling of the gap with the system size. On the contrary, we also argue that, if the phase surrounding the problem Hamiltonian is a Many-Body Localized (MBL) phase, the gaps are going to be typically exponentially small and that this follows naturally from the existence of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase.

In particular, we show that there is an interval where an increase in entanglement fidelity implies a decrease in quantum privacy.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5729
abstract: We achieve essentially the largest possible separation between quantum and classical query complexities. We do so using a property-testing problem called Forrelation, where one needs to decide whether one Boolean function is highly correlated with the Fourier transform of a second function. This problem can be solved using 1 quantum query, yet we show that any randomized algorithm needs ~sqrt(N)/log(N) queries (improving an ~N^{1/4} lower bound of Aaronson). Conversely, we show that this 1 versus ~sqrt(N) separation is optimal: indeed, any t-query quantum algorithm whatsoever can be simulated by an O(N^{1-1/2t})-query randomized algorithm. Thus, resolving an open question of Buhrman et al. from 2002, there is no partial Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is constant and whose randomized query complexity is linear. We conjecture that a natural generalization of Forrelation achieves the optimal t versus ~N^{1-1/2t} separation for all t. As a bonus, we show that this generalization is BQP-complete. This yields what's arguably the simplest BQP-complete problem yet known, and gives a second sense in which Forrelation "captures the maximum power of quantum computation."

Specifically, we show that the population inversion in a two-level system, the splitting and cotunneling of two-interacting bosons, and the stirring of a Tonks-Girardeau gas on a ring to achieve mesoscopic superpositions of many-body rotating and non-rotating states, can be significantly speeded up.

abstract: Distributed quantum communication and quantum computing offer many new opportunities for quantum information processing. Here networks based on highly nonlocal quantum resources with complex entanglement structures have been proposed for distributing, sharing and processing quantum information. Graph states in particular have emerged as powerful resources for such tasks using measurement-based techniques. We report an experimental demonstration of graph-state quantum secret sharing, an important primitive for a quantum network. We use an all-optical setup to encode quantum information into photons representing a five-qubit graph state. We are able to reliably encode, distribute and share quantum information between four parties. In our experiment we demonstrate the integration of three distinct secret sharing protocols, which allow for security and protocol parameters not possible with any single protocol alone. Our results show that graph states are a promising approach for sophisticated multi-layered protocols in quantum networks.

abstract: According to usual definitions, entangled states cannot be given a separable decomposition in terms of products of local density operators. If we relax the requirement that the local density operators be positive, then an entangled quantum state may admit a separable decomposition in terms of more general sets of single-system operators. This form of separability can be used to construct classical models and simulation methods when only restricted set of measurements are available. With such motivations in mind, we ask what are the smallest such sets of local operators such that a pure bipartite entangled quantum state becomes separable? We find that in the case of maximally entangled states there are many inequivalent solutions, including for example the sets of phase point operators that arise in the study of discrete Wigner functions. We therefore provide a new way of interpreting these operators, and more generally, provide an alternative method for constructing local hidden variable models for entangled quantum states under subsets of quantum measurements.

Uncontrolled decoherence is one of the main obstacles that must be overcome in quantum information processing. We study the dynamically decay of coherences in a solid-state qubit by means of the use of a master equation. We analyse the effects induced by thermal Ohmic environments and low-frequency 1/f noise. We focus on the effect of longitudinal and transversal noise on the superconducting qubit's dynamics. Our results can be used to design experimental future setups when manipulating superconducting qubits.

abstract: Nonclassical states are essential for optics-based quantum information processing, but their fragility limits their utility for practical scenarios in which loss and noise inevitably degrade, if not destroy, nonclassicality. Exploiting nonclassical states in quantum metrology yields sensitivity advantages over all classical schemes delivering the same energy per measurement interval to the sample being probed. These enhancements, almost without exception, are severely diminished by quantum decoherence. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing system that is resilient to quantum decoherence. We employ entanglement to realize a 20% signal-to-noise ratio improvement over the optimum classical scheme in an entanglement-breaking environment plagued by 14 dB of loss and a noise background 75 dB stronger than the returned probe light. Our result suggests that advantageous quantum-sensing technology could be developed for practical situations.

We present Bell-like inequalities which have lower bounds for non-steering correlations than for local causal models. The inequalities involve all possible measurement settings at each side. We arrive at interesting and elegant conditions for steerability of arbitrary two-qubit states.

abstract: In this paper, we analyze bipartite steering inequalities which are constructed by mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and Clifford algebra. For MUBs, we can obtain an unbounded largest violation of order $O(\sqrt{d}),$ where $d$ is the dimension of Hilbert space. This is the highest order of violation we know up to now. By using operators of Clifford algebra, we are able to derive a dichotomic steering inequality with unbounded largest violation of order $O(\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}),$ where $n$ is the number of settings. This unbounded largest violation shows that quantum steering is quite different to Bell nonlocality in the asymptotic sense. Because there is no unbounded violation when the number of outcomes in Bell scenario is fixed.

abstract: In this paper, we design a new quantum key distribution protocol, allowing two limited semi-quantum or "classical" users to establish a shared secret key with the help of a fully quantum server. A semi-quantum user can only prepare and measure qubits in the computational basis and so must rely on this quantum server to produce qubits in alternative bases and also to perform alternative measurements. However, we assume that the sever is untrusted and we prove the unconditional security of our protocol even in the worst case: when this quantum server is an all-powerful adversary. We also compute a lower bound of the key rate of our protocol, in the asymptotic scenario, as a function of the observed error rate in the channel allowing us to compute the maximally tolerated error of our protocol. Our results show that a semi-quantum protocol may hold similar security to a fully quantum one.

abstract: The spontaneous emission rate of a quantum dot coupled to a structured photonic reservoir is determined by the frequency dependence of its local density of photon states. Through phonon-dressing, a breakdown of Fermi's golden rule can occur for certain photonic structures whose photon decay time become comparable to the longitudinal acoustic phonon decay times. We present a polaron master equation model to calculate the photoluminescence intensity from a coherently excited quantum dot coupled to a structured photonic reservoir. We consider examples of a semiconductor microcavity and a coupled cavity waveguide and show clear photoluminescence intensity spectral features that contain unique signatures of the interplay between phonon and photon bath coupling.

abstract: An alternative method of detection-loophole-free Bell test is proposed using local hidden variable (LHV) models with optimal detection efficiencies. A framework for constructing such optimal LHV models is presented. Optimal LHV models for maximally and non-maximally entangled twopartite states are constructed to reproduce the quantum correlations within the critical detection efficiencies. The LHV models are shown to be completely equivalent with the existing twopartite Bell inequalities in their optimized setups, and to have even lower critical efficiencies in the LHV modes' own optimized setups. Applications in Bell tests and in device-independent quantum information processing are discussed.

We drive an exciton transition of a self-assembled quantum dot in order to realize a two-level system exposed to bichromatic laser field and observe nearly complete elimination of the resonance fluorescence spectral line at the driving laser frequency. This is caused by quantum interference between coupled transitions among the doubly dressed excitonic states, without population trapping. We also demonstrate multiphoton ac Stark effect with shifted subharmonic resonances and dynamical modifications of resonance fluorescence spectra by using double dressing.

The coupling between polariza- tion and frequency is realized through a frequency shifter and linear optics. When the polarization- frequency degrees of freedom are decoupled, it is robust to create polarization and frequency Bell states, confirmed by the polarization quantum-state tomography and the two-photon temporal quan- tum beating. Making use of the polarization-frequency coupling to transfer polarization phase retard to the entangled frequency modes, we produce a frequency Bell state with tunable phase difference between its two bases.

The decoy-state technique is a powerful tool that can significantly boost the secure transmission range of the QKD systems. However it has not yet been applied to the systems that use coherent detection. After adapting this theory to the systems based on homodyne detection, we quantify the secure performance and transmission range of the resulting system.

abstract: Systems of four nonbinary particles, each having three or more internal states, exhibit maximally entangled states that are inaccessible to four qubits. This breaks the pattern of two- and three-particle systems, in which the existing graph states are equally accessible to binary and nonbinary systems alike. We compare the entanglement properties of these special states (called P-states) with those of the more familiar GHZ and cluster states accessible to qubits. The comparison includes familiar entanglement measures, the "steering" of states by projective measurements, and the probability that two such measurements, chosen at random, leave the remaining particles in a Bell state. These comparisons demonstrate not only that P-state entanglement is stronger than the other types, but that it is maximal in a well-defined sense. We prove that GHZ, cluster, and P-states represent all possible entanglement classes of four-particle graph states with a prime number (>2) of states per particle.

abstract: Continuous observation on an oscillator is known to result in quantum back-action which limits the knowledge acquired by the measurement. A careful balance between the information obtained and the back-action disturbance leads to a limit known as the standard quantum limit. The means to surpass this limit by modulating the measurement strength with the period proportional to half period of the oscillation has been proposed decades ago (Braginskii et al 1978 JETP Lett. 27 276; Thorne et al 1978 Phys. Rev. Lett. 40 667; Braginskii et al 1980 Science 209 547). Such modulated or stroboscopic observation leading to a squeezed state of one quadrature of the oscillator motion with the quantum noise below that of the zero-point fluctuations has been a long-standing goal. Here, we report on the generation of a quadrature-squeezed state of an oscillator by stroboscopic back-action evading measurement. The oscillator is the collective spin of an atomic ensemble precessing in magnetic field. It is initially prepared in nearly the ground state with an average thermal occupancy number $0.08 \pm 0.01$. The oscillator is coupled to the optical mode of a cavity, and the cavity output field detected with polarization homodyning serves as the meter. A back-action-evading measurement is performed by stroboscopically modulating the intensity of the light field at twice the Larmor frequency, resulting in a squeezed state conditioned on the light-polarization measurement with $2.2 \pm 0.3$ dB noise reduction below the zero-point fluctuations for the measured quadrature. The demonstrated squeezing holds promise for metrological advantage in quantum sensing.

abstract: Blind quantum computation (BQC) is a model in which a computation is performed on a server by a client such that the server is kept blind about the input, the algorithm, and the output of the computation. Here we layout a general framework for BQC which, unlike the previous BQC models, does not constructed on specific computational model. A main ingredient of our construction is gate teleportation. We demonstrate that our framework can be straightforwardly implemented on circuit-based models as well as measurement-based models of quantum computation. We illustrate our construction by showing that universal BQC is possible on correlation-space measurement-based quantum computation models.

abstract: Recently, a new model of quantum walk, utilizing recycled coins, was introduced; however little is yet known about its properties. In this paper, we study its behavior on the cycle graph. In particular, we will consider its time averaged distribution and how it is affected by the walk's "memory parameter" - a real parameter, between zero and eight, which affects the walk's coin flip operator. Despite an infinite number of different parameters, our analysis provides evidence that only a few produce non-uniform behavior. Our analysis also shows that the initial state, and cycle size modulo four all affect the behavior of this walk. We also prove an interesting relationship between the recycled coin model and a different memory-based quantum walk recently proposed.

abstract: The holographic principle states that the information about a volume of a system is encoded on the boundary surface of the volume. Holography appears in many branches of physics, such as optics, electromagnetism, many-body physics, quantum gravity, and string theory. Here we show that holography is also an underlying principle in thermodynamics, a most important foundation of physics. The thermodynamics of a system is fully determined by its partition function. We prove that the partition function of a physical system is an analytic function of all the physical parameters, and therefore its values in any area on the complex plane of a physical parameter are uniquely determined by its values along the boundary. The thermodynamic holography has applications in studying thermodynamics of nano-scale systems (such as molecule engines, nano-generators and macromolecules) and provides a new approach to many-body physics.

abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems is typically described by a quantum dynamical semigroup generator ${\cal L}$. The eigenvalues of ${\cal L}$ are complex, reflecting unitary as well as dissipative dynamics. For certain values of parameters defining ${\cal L}$, non-hermitian degeneracies emerge, i.e. exceptional points ($EP$). We study the implications of such points in the open system dynamics of a two-level-system described by the Bloch equation. This open system has become the paradigm of diverse fields in physics, from NMR to quantum information and elementary particles. We find as a function of detuning and driving amplitude a continuous line of exceptional points merging into two cusps of triple degeneracy. The dynamical signature of these $EP$ points is a unique time evolution. This unique feature can be employed experimentally to locate the $EP$ points and thereby to determine the intrinsic system parameters for any desired accuracy.

abstract: Based on recently introduced efficient quantum state tomography schemes, we propose a scalable method for the tomography of unitary processes and the reconstruction of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians. As opposed to the exponential scaling with the number of subsystems of standard quantum process tomography, the method relies only on measurements of linearly many local observables and either (a) the ability to prepare eigenstates of locally informationally complete operators or (b) access to an ancilla of the same size as the to-be-characterized system and the ability to prepare a maximally entangled state on the combined system. As such, the method requires at most linearly many states to be prepared and linearly many observables to be measured. The quality of the reconstruction can be quantified with the same experimental resources that are required to obtain the reconstruction in the first place. Our numerical simulations of several quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians suggest a polynomial scaling of the total number of measurements and post-processing resources.

abstract: Quantum mechanics in Hilbert spaces of finite dimension $N$ is reviewed from the number theoretic point of view. For composite numbers $N$ possible quantum kinematics are classified on the basis of Mackey's Imprimitivity Theorem for finite Abelian groups. This yields also a classification of finite Weyl-Heisenberg groups and the corresponding finite quantum kinematics. Simple number theory gets involved through the fundamental theorem describing all finite discrete Abelian groups of order $N$ as direct products of cyclic groups, whose orders are powers of not necessarily distinct primes contained in the prime decomposition of $N$. The representation theoretic approach is further compared with the algebraic approach, where the basic object is the corresponding operator algebra. The consideration of fine gradings of this associative algebra then brings a fresh look on the relation between the mathematical formalism and physical realizations of finite quantum systems.

abstract: We analyze the Wannier-Stark spectrum of a quantum particle in tilted two-dimensional lattices with the Bloch spectrum consisting of two subbands, which could be either separated by a finite gap or connected at the Dirac points. For rational orientations of the static field given by an arbitrary superposition of the translation vectors the spectrum is a ladder of energy bands. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the energy bands in the limit of large and weak static fields and study them numerically for intermediate field strength. We show that the structure of energy bands determines the rate of spreading of a localized wave packets which is the quantity measured in laboratory experiments. It is shown that wave-packet dispersion becomes a fractal function of the field orientation in the long-time regime of ballistic spreading.

Here, we present a theoretical study of the scattering of two indistinguishable photons on a single two-level atom in a Hong-Ou-Mandel set-up. By computing the dynamics, we can describe the system at any time of the scattering event. This allows us to highlight the one-to-one correspondence between the saturation of the atom and the effective interaction induced between the photons. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications for on-chip quantum computing.

abstract: Recently, Hassanpour and Houshmand have proposed a protocol of controlled deterministic secure quantum communication (Quant. Info. Process, DOI 10.1007/s11128-014-0866-z (2014)). The authors compared the efficiency of their protocol with that of two other existing protocols and claimed that their protocol is efficient. Here, we have shown that the efficiency of Hassanpour Houshmand (HH) protocol is not high, and there exist several approaches through which more efficient protocols for the same task can be designed. To establish this point, we have proposed an efficient protocol of controlled deterministic secure quantum communication which is based on permutation of particles (PoP) technique and is considerably efficient compared to HH protocol. We have also generalized this protocol into its bidirectional counterpart. Interestingly, bipartite entanglement (Bell state) is sufficient for the realization of the proposed protocols, but HH protocol and other existing protocols require at least tripartite entanglement. Further, we have shown that it is possible to construct a large number of efficient protocols of unidirectional and bidirectional controlled deterministic secure quantum communication by using various alternative approaches and different quantum states. These alternative protocols can be realized by modifying the existing protocols of quantum secure direct communication and deterministic secure quantum communication. We have also shown that it is possible to design completely orthogonal-state-based protocols for unidirectional and bidirectional controlled deterministic secure quantum communication.

abstract: Diamond defect centers are promising solid state magnetometers. Single centers allow for high spatial resolution field imaging but are limited in their magnetic field sensitivity to around 10 nT/Hz^(1/2) at room-temperature. Using defect center ensembles sensitivity can be scaled as N^(1/2) when N is the number of defects. In the present work we use an ensemble of 1e11 defect centers for sensing. By carefully eliminating all noise sources like laser intensity fluctuations, microwave amplitude and phase noise we achieve a photon shot noise limited field sensitivity of 0.9 pT/Hz^(1/2) at room-temperature with an effective sensor volume of 8.5e-4 mm^3. The smallest field we measured with our device is 100 fT. While this denotes the best diamond magnetometer sensitivity so far, further improvements using decoupling sequences and material optimization could lead to fT/Hz^(1/2) sensitivity.

abstract: We analyze a model where a closed $V$ system is excited by two uncorrelated partially coherent fields. We use a collisionally broadened CW laser, which is a good model for an experimentally realizable partially coherent field, and show that it is possible to generate excited state coherences even if the two fields are uncorrelated. This transient coherence can be increased if splitting between the excited states is reduced relative to the radiation coherence time, $\tau_{d}$. For small excited state splitting, one can use this scheme to generate a long lived coherent response in the system.

abstract: Colbeck (Thesis, 2006) proposed using quantum nonlocal games to extract verified randomness from an untrusted quantum device. While full quantum-security proofs have been given, it remains a major open problem to identify the broadest class of nonlocal games and the lowest performance requirement for the implementing device for achieving such security. In this paper, we answer this question for a natural class of protocols in which a single bit of information is recorded at each round. We show that the obvious necessary condition on the game and the performance threshold -- that the bits cannot be fully deterministic -- is also sufficient for ensuring quantum security. Besides broadening the class of games, this result greatly improves the known noise tolerance (i.e., the gap between the actual and the quantum-optimal winning probabilities) for secure randomness expansion. For the most commonly used CHSH game, we show that the noise can be as high as 10.3% while achieving full security, compared with 1.5% in the best previous result. We also show that similar results hold with nonlocality replaced by the broader concept of contextuality, and the spatial separation requirement replaced by the broader compatibility requirement. This is the first full quantum security proof for contextuality-based randomness expansion. The main technical contribution in our proofs is a strong Schatten-norm uncertainty principle which is based on the uniform convexity inequality of Ball, Carlen, and Lieb (Inventiones mathematicae, 115:463-482, 1994).

abstract: We demonstrate that stationary localized solutions (discrete solitons) exist in a one dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattices with gain and loss in the semiclassical regime. Stationary solutions, by defi- nition, are robust and do not demand for state preparation. Losses, unavoidable in experiments, are not a drawback, but a necessary ingredient for these modes to exist. The semiclassical calculations are complemented with their classical limit and dynamics based on a Gutzwiller Ansatz. We argue that circuit QED architectures are ideal platforms for realizing the physics developed here. Finally, within the input-output formalism, we explain how to experimentally access the different phases, including the solitons, of the chain.

abstract: To use quantum systems for technological applications we first need to preserve their coherence for macroscopic timescales, even at finite temperature. Quantum error correction has made it possible to actively correct errors that affect a quantum memory. An attractive scenario is the construction of passive storage of quantum information with minimal active support. Indeed, passive protection is the basis of robust and scalable classical technology, physically realized in the form of the transistor and the ferromagnetic hard disk. The discovery of an analogous quantum system is a challenging open problem, plagued with a variety of no-go theorems. Several approaches have been devised to overcome these theorems by taking advantage of their loopholes. Here we review the state-of-the-art developments in this field in an informative and pedagogical way. We give the main principles of self-correcting quantum memories and we analyze several milestone examples from the literature of two-, three- and higher-dimensional quantum memories.

abstract: Berry's approach on "transitionless quantum driving" shows how to set a Hamiltonian which drives the dynamics of a system along instantaneous eigenstates of a reference Hamiltonian to reproduce the same final result of an adiabatic process in a shorter time. In this paper, motivated by transitionless quantum driving, we construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage in a three-atom system to create the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with the help of quantum Zeno dynamics and of non-resonant lasers. The influence of various decoherence processes is discussed by numerical simulation and the result proves that the scheme is fast and robust against decoherence and operational imperfection.

abstract: The largest number factored on a quantum device reported until now was 143. That quantum computation, which used only 4 qubits at 300K, actually also factored much larger numbers such as 3599, 11663, and 56153, without the awareness of the authors of that work. Furthermore, unlike the implementations of Shor's algorithm performed thus far, these 4-qubit factorizations do not need to use prior knowledge of the answer. However, because they only use 4 qubits, these factorizations can also be performed trivially on classical computers. We discover a class of numbers for which the power of quantum information actually comes into play. We then demonstrate a 3-qubit factorization of 175, which would be the first quantum factorization of a triprime.

abstract: A projected entangled pair state (PEPS) with ancillas can be evolved in imaginary time to obtain thermal states of a strongly correlated quantum system on a 2D lattice. Every application of a Suzuki-Trotter gate multiplies the PEPS bond dimension $D$ by a factor $k$. It has to be renormalized back to the original $D$. In order to preserve the accuracy of the Suzuki-Trotter (S-T) decomposition, the renormalization has in principle to take into account full environment made of the new tensors with the bond dimension $k\times D$. Here we propose a self-consistent renormalization procedure operating with the original bond dimension $D$, but without compromising the accuracy of the S-T decomposition. The iterative procedure renormalizes the bond using full environment made of renormalized tensors with the bond dimension $D$. After every renormalization, the new renormalized tensors are used to update the environment, and then the renormalization is repeated again and again until convergence. As a benchmark application, we obtain thermal states of the transverse field quantum Ising model on a square lattice - both infinite and finite - evolving the system across a second-order phase transition at finite temperature.

These scenarios are currently experimentally feasible. The parameters of the ellipse and the lattice and the coefficients of the constituent coherent states are optimized numerically, via a genetic algorithm, in order to obtain the best approximation. It is found that for certain quantum states the obtained approximation is better than the ones known from the literature thus far.

abstract: We report the direct -- continuous in phase -- sampling of a regularized $P$ function, the so-called nonclassicality quasiprobability, for squeezed light. Through their negativities, the resulting phase-space representation uncovers the quantum character of the squeezed vacuum state. To realize the equal phase distribution of measured quadratures, a data selection is implemented with quantum random numbers created by measuring the vacuum noise. The continuously measured squeezed field was generated in an optical parametric amplifier. Suitable pattern functions for obtaining the regularized $P$ function are investigated. The significance of detecting negativities in our application is determined. The sampling of nonclassicality quasiprobabilities is shown to be a powerful and universal method to visualize quantum effects within arbitrary quantum states. We can also conclude that relatively few data are sufficient for the determination of highly significant negativities.

Recently Chen et. al. have proposed a more generalized Hardy-like argument and have shown that the probability of success increases with local system's dimension. Here we study the same in a minimally constrained theory, namely the generalized no-signaling theory(GNST). We find that not only the probability of success of this argument increases with local system dimension in GNST, it also takes a very simple functional form.

abstract: Wavefunction collapse models modify Schr\"odinger's equation so that it describes the collapse of a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states as a dynamical process. This provides a basis for the resolution of the quantum measurement problem. An additional generic consequence of the collapse mechanism is that it causes particles to exhibit a tiny random diffusive motion. Here it is shown that for the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model---one of the most well developed collapse models---the diffusions of two sufficiently nearby particles are positively correlated. An experimental test of this effect is proposed in which random displacements of pairs of free nanoparticles are measured after they have been simultaneously released from nearby traps. The experiment must be carried out at sufficiently low temperature and pressure in order for the collapse effects to dominate over the ambient environmental noise. It is argued that these constraints can be satisfied by current technologies for a large region of the viable parameter space of the CSL model. The effect disappears as the separation between particles exceeds the CSL length scale. The test therefore provides a means of bounding this length scale.

abstract: We provide experimental evidence of quantum features in bi-partite states classified as entirely classical according to a conventional criterion based on the Glauber P-function but possessing non-zero Gaussian quantum discord. Their quantum nature is experimentally revealed by acting locally on one part of the discordant state. Adding an environmental system purifying the state, we unveil the flow of quantum correlations within a global pure system using the Koashi-Winter inequality. We experimentally verify and investigate the counterintuitive effect of discord increase under the action of local loss and link it to the entanglement with the environment. For a discordant state generated by splitting a state in which the initial squeezing is destroyed by random displacements, we demonstrate the recovery of entanglement highlighting the role of system-environment correlations.

A sufficient and necessary condition for the non-Markovianity of our channel based on Gaussian inputs is proved. Various criteria for detecting non-Markovianity are also investigated by checking the dynamical evolution of the channel.

abstract: By introducing the scalar potential as modification in the mass term of the Klein-Gordon equation, the influence of a Coulomb-type potential on the Klein-Gordon oscillator is investigated. Relativistic bound states solutions are achieved to both attractive and repulsive Coulomb-type potentials and the arising of a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of angular frequency of the Klein-Gordon oscillator on the quantum numbers of the system is shown.

abstract: In order to make the quantum mechanics a closed theory one has to derive the Born rule from the first principles, like the Schroedinger equation, rather than postulate it. The Born rule was in certain sense derived in several articles, e.g. in [D. Deutsch, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A455, 3129 (1999)] and [W. H. Zurek, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 120404 (2003)]. In this work some arguments of previous authors are simplified and made more "physical". It is shown how to derive the Born rule using the conservation of quantum state norm $\langle\Psi|\Psi\rangle$ that is the unitary evolution property determined by the Schroedinger equation. It is this property that makes the probability equal to the square of the amplitude modulus. We also present arguments in the spirit of the Many-World Interpretation to explain the origin of probabilistic behavior. Simply speaking, the randomness appears as a result of representing the wave function by using a detector of discrete nature that is found only in one state at a time, out of two or more possible states.

abstract: We propose a family of local CSS stabilizer codes in 3D as candidates for self-correcting quantum memories. The construction is inspired by the classical Ising model on a Sierpinski carpet fractal, which acts as a classical self-correcting memory. Our models are naturally defined on fractal subsets of a 4D hypercubic lattice which can be embedded into 3D space with finite distortion. The X and Z sectors of the code are dual to one another, and we show that there exists a finite temperature phase transition associated with each of these sectors, providing evidence that the system may robustly store quantum information at finite temperature.

abstract: The violation of Bell, CHSH and CH inequalities indicates only that the assumption of "conterfactual definiteness" and/or the probabilistic models used in proofs were incorrect. In this paper we discuss in detail an intimate relation between experimental protocols and probabilistic models. In particular we show that local realistic and stochastic hidden variable models are inconsistent with the experimental protocols used in spin polarization correlation experiments. In particular these models neglect a contextual character of quantum theory (QT) and do not describe properly quantum measurements. We argue that the violation of various inequalities gives arguments against the irreducible randomness of act of the measurement. Therefore quantum probabilities are reducible what means that QT is emergent. In this case one could expect to discover in time series of data some unpredicted fine structures proving that QT is not predictably complete what would be a major discovery.

abstract: We analyze the transfer of a quantum state between two resonators connected by a superconducting transmission line. Nearly perfect state-transfer efficiency can be achieved by using adjustable couplers and destructive interference to cancel the back-reflection into the transmission line at the receiving coupler. We show that the transfer protocol is robust to parameter variations affecting the transmission amplitudes of the couplers. We also show that the effects of Gaussian filtering, pulse-shape noise, and multiple reflections on the transfer efficiency are insignificant. However, the transfer protocol is very sensitive to frequency mismatch between the two resonators. Moreover, the tunable coupler we considered produces time-varying frequency detuning caused by the changing coupling. This detuning requires an active frequency compensation with an accuracy better than 90% to yield the transfer efficiency above 99%.

abstract: Optomechanically-induced transparency (OMIT) and the associated slowing of light provide the basis for storing photons in nanoscale devices. Here we study OMIT in parity-time (PT)-symmetric microresonators with a tunable gain-to-loss ratio. This system features a reversed, non-amplifying transparency, i.e., an inverted-OMIT. When the gain-to-loss ratio is varied, the system exhibits a transition from a PT-symmetric phase to a broken-PT-symmetric phase. This PT-phase transition results in the reversal of the pump and gain dependence of the transmission rates. Moreover, we show that by tuning the pump power at a fixed gain-to-loss ratio, or the gain-to-loss ratio at a fixed pump power, one can switch from slow to fast light and vice versa. These findings provide new tools for controlling light propagation using nanofabricated phononic devices.

abstract: We derive the curvature induced quantum-mechanical potential of a neutral spinless particle constrained to move on a surface of revolution. Using the thin-layer quantization scheme, we decompose the tangent component of the Schr\"odinger equation from the transverse component. The tangent Schr\"odinger equation is separated into angular and axial direction in cylindrical coordinate. The exactly solvable model with the shape of truncated cone is investigated and its geometrical induced states are given analytically. With hard wall boundary condition, we find that energy levels and energy differences decrease monotonically with raising the height and generatrix slope of the geometry. Moreover, particles possessing higher kinetic energy tends to occupy the place with greater curvature. These results do good favor to concerned nano-structure experiment.

abstract: We consider the problem of removal of ordering ambiguity in position dependent mass quantum systems characterized by a generalized position dependent mass Hamiltonian which generalizes a number of Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian ordered forms of the Hamiltonian. We implement point canonical transformation method to map one-dimensional time-independent position dependent mass Schr$\"{o}$dinger equation endowed with potentials onto constant mass counterparts which are considered to be exactly solvable. We observe that a class of mass functions and the corresponding potentials give rise to solutions that do not depend on any particular ordering, leading to the removal of ambiguity in it. In this case, it is imperative that the ordering is Hermitian. For non-Hermitian ordering we show that the class of systems can also be exactly solvable and are also shown to be iso-spectral using suitable similarity transformations. We also discuss the normalization of the eigenfunctions obtained from both Hermitian and non-Hermitian orderings. We illustrate the technique with the quadratic Li$\'{e}$nard type nonlinear oscillators, which admit position dependent mass Hamiltonians.

abstract: Quantum teleportation is the transfer of quantum information between two locations by the use of shared entanglement. Current teleportation schemes broadly fall under one of two categories, of either qubit or continuous variables teleportation. Spin coherent states on spin ensembles can be teleported under the continuous variables approximation for states with small deviations from a given polarization. However, for spin coherent states with large deviations, no convenient teleportation protocol exists. Recently, we introduced a teleportation scheme where a spin coherent state lying on the equator of the Bloch sphere is teleported between distant parties (A.N. Pyrkov and T. Byrnes, New. J. Phys. 16, 073038 (2014)). Here we generalize the protocol to a spin coherent state with an arbitrary position on Bloch sphere. Our proposed scheme breaks classical bounds based on communication in the unconditional case and quantum state estimation with postselection.

abstract: The preeminent view that evaporating black holes should simply be smaller black holes has been challenged by the firewall paradox. In particular, this paradox suggests that something different occurs once a black hole has evaporated to one-half its original surface area. Here we derive variations of the firewall paradox by tracking the thermodynamic entropy within a black hole across its entire lifetime. Our approach sweeps away many unnecessary assumptions, allowing us to demonstrate a paradox exists even after its initial onset (when conventional assumptions render earlier analyses invalid). Our results suggest that not only is the formation of a firewall the most natural resolution, but provides a mechanism for it. Finally, although firewalls cannot have evolved for modest-sized black holes, within the age of the universe, we speculate on the implications if they were ever unambiguously observed.

abstract: The radiation-pressure interaction between electromagnetic fields and mechanical resonators can be used to efficiently entangle two light fields which couple to a single mechanical mode. We analyze the performance of this process under realistic optomechanical conditions, and we determine the effectiveness of the resulting entanglement as a resource for quantum teleportation of continuous-variable light signals, over large distances, mediated by concatenated swap operations. We study the sensitiveness of the protocol to the quality factor of the mechanical systems, and its performance in non-ideal situations in which losses and reduced detection efficiencies are taken into account.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7218
abstract: We prove uncertainty relations that quantitatively express the impossibility of jointly sharp preparation of pre- and post-selected quantum states for measuring incompatible observables during the weak measurement. By defining a suitable operator whose average in the pre-selected quantum state gives the weak value, we show that one can have new uncertainty relations for variances of two such operators corresponding to two non-commuting observables. These generalize the recent stronger uncertainty relations that give non-trivial lower bounds for the sum of variances of two observables which fully capture the concept of incompatible observables. Furthermore, we show that weak values for two non-commuting projection operators obey a complementarity relation. Specifically, we show that for a pre-selected state if we measure a projector corresponding to an observable $A$ weakly followed by the strong measurement of another observable $B$ (for the post-selection) and, for the same pre-selected state we measure a projector corresponding to an observable $B$ weakly followed by the strong measurement of the observable $A$ (for the post-selection), then the product of these two weak values is always less than one. This shows that even though individually they are complex and can be large, their product is always bounded.

abstract: Photonic systems based on energy-time entanglement have been proposed to test local realism using the Bell inequality. A violation of this inequality normally also certifies security of device-independent quantum key distribution, so that an attacker cannot eavesdrop or control the system. Here, we show how this security test can be circumvented in energy-time entangled systems when using standard avalanche photodetectors, allowing an attacker to compromise the system without leaving a trace. With tailored pulses of classical light we reach Bell values up to 3.63 at 97.6% detector efficiency which is an extreme violation. This is the first demonstration of a violation-faking source that both gives tunable violation and high detector efficiency. The implications are severe: the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality cannot be used to show device-independent security for standard postselecting energy-time entanglement setups. We conclude with suggestions of improved tests and experimental setups that can re-establish device-independent security.

abstract: We study the query complexity of computing a function f:{0,1}^n-->R_+ in expectation. This requires the algorithm on input x to output a nonnegative random variable whose expectation equals f(x), using as few queries to the input x as possible. We exactly characterize both the randomized and the quantum query complexity by two polynomial degrees, the nonnegative literal degree and the sum-of-squares degree, respectively. We observe that the quantum complexity can be unboundedly smaller than the classical complexity for some functions, but can be at most polynomially smaller for functions with range {0,1}. These query complexities relate to (and are motivated by) the extension complexity of polytopes. The linear extension complexity of a polytope is characterized by the randomized communication complexity of computing its slack matrix in expectation, and the semidefinite (psd) extension complexity is characterized by the analogous quantum model. Since query complexity can be used to upper bound communication complexity of related functions, we can derive some upper bounds on psd extension complexity by constructing efficient quantum query algorithms. As an example we give an exponentially-close entrywise approximation of the slack matrix of the perfect matching polytope with psd-rank only 2^{n^{1/2+epsilon}}. Finally, we show there is a precise sense in which randomized/quantum query complexity in expectation corresponds to the Sherali-Adams and Lasserre hierarchies, respectively.

abstract: Efficient coupling of light to single atomic systems has gained considerable attention over the past decades. This development is driven by the continuous growth of quantum technologies. The efficient coupling of light and matter is an enabling technology for quantum information processing and quantum communication. And indeed, in recent years much progress has been made in this direction. But applications aside, the interaction of photons and atoms is a fundamental physics problem. There are various possibilities for making this interaction more efficient, among them the apparently 'natural' attempt of mode-matching the light field to the free-space emission pattern of the atomic system of interest. Here we will describe the necessary steps of implementing this mode-matching with the ultimate aim of reaching unit coupling efficiency. We describe the use of deep parabolic mirrors as the central optical element of a free-space coupling scheme, covering the preparation of suitable modes of the field incident onto these mirrors as well as the location of an atom at the mirror's focus. Furthermore, we establish a robust method for determining the efficiency of the photon-atom coupling.

We investigate what constraints quantum mechanics poses on these issues, in light of recent experiments with entangled photons.

While for $4>n>1$ the bosonic subgroup in $\text{UOSp}((3^n+1)/2 | (3^n-1)/2)$ does not contain the standard global unitary group $\text{SU}(2^n)$, it does have an $\text{USp}(2^n)\subset\text{SU}(2^n)$ subgroup which acts transitively on the $n$-qubit subspace, as required for consistency with the conventional multi-qubit framework. For two superqubits the $\text{UOSp}(5|4)$ action is used to generate entangled states from the "bosonic" separable state $|00>$.

abstract: We analyze the emergence of diffractive focusing in the transition from discrete to continuous space-time variables. Three types of dynamical equations are studied in a top-to-bottom approach, starting with the most general system. First we solve a linear cellular automaton of two species, then a nearest neighbour tight-binding array and finally the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. All models are shown to produce diffractive solutions for square packet distributions. The main result of this paper is that in discrete variables, the nature of the solutions depends strongly on the size of wavepackets, whereas in continuous variables, diffraction due to discontinuities exists at every scale. A transition in the number of participants or cells is identified by means of a measure and the corresponding phenomenon is further analyzed by a generalization of Wigner functions to discrete variables and crystals.

Randomized modulation of those signals spreads their energy through the frequency spectrum and can help to mitigate electromagnetic interference problems.

The paper describes pulse width modulation schemes where a Poissonian light source acts as a random control that spreads the energy of the potential interfering signals. I give an example application for switching-mode power supplies and comment the further possibilities of the method.

abstract: Recently, model systems with quadratic Hamiltonians and time-dependent interactions were studied by Briegel and Popescu and by Galve et al. in order to consider the possibility of both quantum refrigeration in enzymes [Proc. R. Soc. 469 20110290 (2013)] and entanglement in the high temperature limit [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105 180501 (2010); Phys. Rev. A 81 062117 (2010)]. Following this line of research, we studied a model comprising two quantum harmonic oscillators driven by a time-dependent harmonic coupling. Such a system was embedded in a thermal bath represented in two different ways. In one case, the bath was composed of a finite but great number of independent harmonic oscillators with an Ohmic spectral density. In the other case, the bath was more efficiently defined in terms of a single oscillator coupled to a non-Hamiltonian thermostat. In both cases, we simulated the effect of the thermal disorder on the generation of the squeezed states in the two-oscillators relevant system. We found that, in our model, the thermal disorder of the bath determines the presence of a threshold temperature, for the generation of squeezed states, equal to T=311.13 K. Such a threshold is estimated to be within temperatures where chemical reactions and biological activity comfortably take place.

abstract: We present a simple family of Bell inequalities applicable to a scenario involving arbitrarily many parties, each of which performs two binary-outcome measurements. We show that these inequalities are members of the complete set of full-correlation Bell inequalities discovered by Werner-Wolf-Zukowski-Brukner. For scenarios involving a small number of parties, we further verify that these inequalities are facet-defining for the convex set of Bell-local correlations. Moreover, we show that the amount of quantum violation of these inequalities naturally manifests the extent to which the underlying system is genuinely many-body entangled. In other words, our Bell inequalities, when supplemented with the appropriate quantum bounds, naturally serve as device-independent witnesses for entanglement depth, allowing one to certify genuine k-partite entanglement in an arbitrary $n\ge k$-partite scenario without relying on any assumption about the measurements being performed, nor the dimension of the underlying physical system. A brief comparison is made between our witnesses and those based on some other Bell inequalities, as well as the quantum Fisher information. A family of witnesses for genuine k-partite nonlocality applicable to an arbitrary $n\ge k$-partite scenario based on our Bell inequalities is also presented.

abstract: Quantum computing becomes viable when a quantum state can be preserved from environmentally-induced error. If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently reliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of identifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation by guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical failure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the qubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in quantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from environmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors with increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a natural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track errors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition (QND) parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the failure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 for five qubits and a factor of 8.5 for nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we tomographically verify preservation of the non-classical Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The successful suppression of environmentally-induced errors strongly motivates further research into the many exciting challenges associated with building a large-scale superconducting quantum computer.

abstract: The ability to filter unwanted light signals is critical to the operation of quantum memories based on neutral atom ensembles. Here we demonstrate an efficient frequency filter which uses a vapor cell filled with $^{85}$Rb and a buffer gas to attenuate both residual laser light and noise photons by nearly two orders of magnitude with little loss to the single photons associated with our cold $^{87}$Rb quantum memory. This simple, passive filter provides an additional 18 dB attenuation of our pump laser and erroneous spontaneous emissions for every 1 dB loss of the single photon signal. We show that the addition of a frequency filter increases the non-classical correlations and readout efficiency of our quantum memory by $\approx35\%$.

abstract: We show analytically that the collapse and revival in the population dynamics of the atom-cavity coupled system under the rotating wave approximation (RWA), valid only at very weak coupling, is an artifact as the atom-cavity coupling is increased. Even the first-order correction to the RWA is able to bring about the absence of the collapse in the dynamics of atomic population inversion thanks to intrinsic oscillations resulting from the transitions between two levels with the same atomic quantum number. The removal of the collapse is valid for a wide range of coupling strengths which are accessible to current experimental setups. In addition, based on our analytical results that greatly improve upon the conventional RWA, even the strong-coupling power spectrum can now be explained with the help of the numerically exact energy levels.

abstract: We investigate the uncertainty principle for two successive projective measurements in terms of R\'enyi entropy based on a single quantum system. Our results cover a large family of the entropy (including the Shannon entropy) uncertainty relations with a lower optimal bound. We compare our relation with other formulations of the uncertainty principle in a two-spin observables measured on a pure quantum state of qubit. It is shown that the low bound of our uncertainty relation has better tightness.

abstract: The effect of a local trace-preserving single-qubit channel on a two-qubit state is investigated in the picture of the quantum steering ellipsoids (QSE). The phenomenon of locally increased quantum correlation is visualized in this picture. We strictly prove that a $B$-side two-qubit discordant state can be locally prepared from a classical state by a trace-preserving channel on qubit $B$ if and only if its QSE of $B$ is a non-radial line segment. For states with higer-dimensional QSEs, the phenomenon of locally increased quantum correlation generally happens when the shape of the QSE is like a baguette. Based on this observation, we find a class of entangled states whose quantum discord can be increased by the local amplitude damping channel. Further, We find that the local quantum channel does not increase the size of QSEs of either qubit $A$ or qubit $B$, for the needle-shape QSE states, as well as the Bell diagonal states with higher-dimensional QSE.

abstract: In this paper, a symplectic and time-reversible integrator is proposed of simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics with constraints in path integral molecular dynamics. The constraints are tackled by Matrix Inverted Linearized Constraint algorithm (MILC), while a slight modification is requested under normal mode representation, and the slow force is mollified by Equilibrium method (Equilibrium MOLLY) to ameliorate the numerical resonance. It is demonstrated that the slow force impulse can be evaluated only at the centroid of beads, instead of being evaluated at the positions of each bead independently. Therefore, it not only allows longer time step but also reduces the complexity of computation. The numerical experiment is performed using SPC/E model in 298K with eight beads. Further discussion will involve the application of Equilibrium MOLLY in flexible bond model.

abstract: We study the nonclassical correlations in a two-qubit state by the perturbing local unitary operation method. We find that the definitions of various non-classicalities including quantum discord (QD), measurement-induced nonlocality (MIN) and so on usually do not have a unique definition when expressed as the perturbation of local unitary operations, so a given non-classicality can lead to different definitions of its dual non-classicality. In addition, it is shown that QD and MIN are not the corresponding dual expressions in a simple set of unitary operations, even though they are in their original definitions. In addition, we also consider the non-classicalities in general $2\otimes d$ dimensional systems.

abstract: In this paper, we study the entanglement and quantum discord of the output modes in the unified $1\rightarrow 2$ state-dependent cloning and probabilistic quantum cloning. The tripartite entanglement among the output modes and the quantum cloning machine is also considered. We find that the roles of the quantum correlations including the bipartite and tripartite entanglement and quantum discord strongly depend on the quantum cloning machines as well as the cloned state. In particular, it is found that this quantum cloning scheme can be realizable even without any quantum correlation.

abstract: In general, it is important to identify what is the informational resource for quantum tasks. Quantum energy teleportation (QET) is a quantum task, which attains energy transfer in an operational meaning by local operations and classical communication, and is expected to play a role in future development of nano scale smart grids. We consider QET protocols in a three-element Ising spin system with non periodic boundary conditions coupled to a thermal bath. The open chain is the minimal model of QET between two edge spins that allows the measurement and operation steps of the QET protocol to be optimized without restriction. It is possible to analyze how two-body correlations of the system, like mutual information, entanglement and quantum discord, can be resources of this QET at each temperature. In particular, we stress that quantum discord is not the QET resource in some cases even if arbitrary measurements and operations are available.

abstract: We investigate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlation (EPR), the quadrature squeezing and the continuous variable quantum teleportation when considering non-Gaussian entangled states generated by applying multiple-photon addition and multiple-photon subtraction to a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSVs). Our results indicate that, in the case of symmetric multiple-photon-subtracted TMSVs, the corresponding EPR correlation, the two-mode squeezing, the sum squeezing and the fidelity of teleporting a coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state can be enhanced for any squeezing parameter $r$, and these enhancements increase with the number of the operations in small-squeezing regime. While asymmetric multiple-photon subtractions will generally reduce these quantities. For the multiple-photon added TMSVs, although it holds stronger entanglement, its EPR correlation, two-mode squeezing, sum squeezing and the fidelity of a coherent state are always smaller than that of the TMSVs. Only when considering teleporting a squeezed vacuum state, the symmetric photon addition makes somewhat improvement of the fidelity in large squeezing parameters. Furthermore, the optimal entanglement, the optimal EPR correlation, the optimal quadrature squeezing and the optimal fidelity, the four quantities always prefer to symmetrical arrangements of photon addition or subtraction on the two modes. Finally, we analytically prove that one-mode multiple-photon subtracted TMSVs is equivalent to that of the one-mode multiple-photon added one, and one-mode multiple-photon operations do not enhance the above four quantities at all, and even diminish them.

abstract: We show that light scattering from an ultracold gas reveals not only density correlations, but also matter-field interference at its shortest possible distance in an optical lattice, which defines key properties such as tunneling and matter-field phase gradients. This signal can be enhanced by concentrating probe light between lattice sites rather than at density maxima. As addressing between two single sites is challenging, we focus on global nondestructive scattering, allowing probing order parameters, matter-field quadratures and their squeezing. The scattering angular distribution displays peaks even if classical diffraction is forbidden and we derive generalized Bragg conditions. Light scattering distinguishes all phases in the Mott insulator - superfluid - Bose glass phase transition.

abstract: We present two maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian systems ${\cal H}_\lambda$ and ${\cal H}_\eta$ that are defined, respectively, on an $N$-dimensional spherically symmetric generalization of the Darboux surface of type III and on an $N$-dimensional Taub-NUT space. Afterwards, we show that the quantization of ${\cal H}_\lambda$ and ${\cal H}_\eta$ leads, respectively, to exactly solvable deformations (with parameters $\lambda$ and $\eta$) of the two basic quantum mechanical systems: the harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb problem. In both cases the quantization is performed in such a way that the maximal superintegrability of the classical Hamiltonian is fully preserved. In particular, we prove that this strong condition is fulfilled by applying the so-called conformal Laplace-Beltrami quantization prescription, where the conformal Laplacian operator contains the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator on the underlying manifold plus a term proportional to its scalar curvature (which in both cases has non-constant value). In this way, the eigenvalue problems for the quantum counterparts of ${\cal H}_\lambda$ and ${\cal H}_\eta$ can be rigorously solved, and it is found that their discrete spectrum is just a smooth deformation (in terms of the parameters $\lambda$ and $\eta$) of the oscillator and Coulomb spectrum, respectively. Moreover, it turns out that the maximal degeneracy of both systems is preserved under deformation. Finally, new further multiparametric generalizations of both systems that preserve their superintegrability are envisaged.

abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum dissension for three qubit states in various dissipative channels such as amplitude damping, dephasing and depolarizing. Our study is solely based on Markovian environments where quantum channels are without memory and each qubit is coupled to its own environment. We start with mixed GHZ, mixed W, mixture of separable states, a mixed biseparable state, as the initial states and mostly observe that the decay of quantum dissension is asymptotic in contrast to sudden death of quantum entanglement in similar environments. This is a clear indication of the fact that quantum correlation in general is more robust against the effect of noise. However, for a given class of initial mixed states we find a temporary leap in quantum dissension for a certain interval of time. More precisely, we observe the revival of quantum correlation to happen for certain time period. This signifies that the measure of quantum correlation such as quantum discord, quantum dissension, defined from the information theoretic perspective is different from the correlation defined from the entanglement-separability paradigm and can increase under the effect of the local noise. We also study the effects of these channels on the monogamy score of each of these initial states. Interestingly, we find that for certain class of states and channels, there is change from negative values to positive values of the monogamy score with classical randomness as well as with time. This gives us an important insight in obtaining states which are freely sharable (polygamous state) from the states which are not freely sharable (monogamous). This is indeed a remarkable feature, as we can create monogamous states from polygamous states Monogamous states are considered to have more signatures of quantum ness and can be used for security purpose.

abstract: Dynamical decoupling operations have been shown to reduce errors in quantum information processing. Leakage from an encoded subspace to the rest of the system space is a particularly serious problem for which leakage elimination operators (LEO) were introduced. These are a particular type of decoupling which are designed to eliminate such leakage errors. Here, we provide an analysis of non-ideal pulses, rather than the well-understood ideal pulses or bang-bang controls. We show that under realistic conditions for experiments these controls will provide protection from errors. Furthermore, we find that the effect of LEOs depends exclusively on the integral of the pulse sequence in the time domain with proper ratio of pulse duration time and its period. When these two key parameters are chosen within certain bounds, leakage errors of the open system (exemplified by a three-level system for the nitrogen-vacancy centers under external magnetic field) would be dramatically decreased. The results are illustrated by the fidelity dynamics of LEO sequences, ranging from regular rectangular pulses, random pulses and even disordered (noisy) pulses.

abstract: Exploring Einstein's theories of relativity in quantum systems, for example by using atomic clocks at high speeds can deepen our knowledge in physics. However, many challenges still remain on finding novel methods for detecting effects of gravity and of special relativity and their roles in light-matter interaction. Here we introduce a scheme of x-ray quantum optics that allows for a millimeter scale investigation of the relativistic redshift by directly probing a fixed nuclear crystal in Earth's gravitational field with x-rays. Alternatively, a compact rotating crystal can be used to force interacting x-rays to experience inhomogeneous clock tick rates in a crystal. We find that an association of gravitational or special-relativistic time dilation with quantum interference will be manifested by deflections of x-ray photons. Our protocol suggests a new and feasible tabletop solution for probing effects of gravity and special relativity in the quantum world.

abstract: First, I introduce quantum graph theory. I also discuss a known lower bound on the independence numbers and derive from it an upper bound on the chromatic numbers of quantum graphs. Then, I construct a family of quantum graphs that can be described as tropical, cyclical, and commutative. I also define a step logarithm function and express with it the bounds on quantum graph invariants in closed form. Finally, I obtain an upper bound on the independence numbers and a lower bound on the chromatic numbers of the constructed quantum graphs that are similar in form to the existing bounds. I also show that the constructed family contains graphs of any valence with arbitrarily high chromatic numbers and conclude by it that quantum graph colorings are quite different from classical graph colorings.

abstract: We derive an upper bound for the distinguishability-based non-Markovianity measure of a two-level system and prove that for certain master equations the exact value of the measure achieves this bound. Furthermore, we obtain an easily calculable lower bound for the divisibility-based non-Markovianity measure of an $n$-level system. We illustrate the calculation of these bounds through examples, considering in detail the spin-boson model. We show that the differences between the two measures in the spin-boson model are caused by the drift vector that is also responsible for the non-unitality of the dynamical map.

abstract: The geometry of cosets in the subgroups H of the two-generator free group G =<a, b> nicely fits, via Grothendieck's dessins d'enfants, the geometry of commutation for quantum observables. Dessins stabilize point-line incidence geometries that reflect the commutation of (generalized) Pauli operators [Information 5, 209 (2014); 1310.4267 and 1404.6986 (quant-ph)]. Now we find that the non-existence of a dessin for which the commutator (a, b) = a^ (-1) b^( -1) ab precisely corresponds to the commutator of quantum observables [A, B] = AB -- BA on all lines of the geometry is a signature of quantum contextuality. This occurs first at index |G : H| = 9 in Mermin's square and at index 10 in Mermin's pentagram, as expected. Commuting sets of n-qubit observables with n > 3 are found to be contextual as well as most generalized polygons. A geometrical contextuality measure is introduced.

abstract: High fidelity quantum information transport is necessary for most practical models of quantum computation. By analogy with optical wave guides, a spatio-temporally varying magnetic potential on a one dimensional spin chain can achieve high fidelity transport of spin excitations. By comparing different potential shapes, we establish the effects of potential shape on the fidelity and transport speed. We incorporate disorder into our model and show methods to minimise its effect on transport. Finally, we discuss implementations of our scheme in several accessible systems based on hydrogenic approximations.

abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) exhibit a fundamental property of non-Abelian statistics, which makes them potentially useful as ideal quantum bits to manipulate certain topological quantum tasks. Rapid theoretical developments have greatly reduced the technological requirements and made it possible to experimentally observe MZMs. However, until now, only a few positive signatures of the formation of MZMs have been reported in solid-state systems, and there has been no investigation of their crucial non-Abelian aspects. Here, we experimentally investigate the non-Abelian character of MZMs in the Kitaev chain model using a photonic quantum simulator. Through the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the geometry phases of the braiding of two MZMs can be directly obtained in an optical system. The local phase-error immunity of MZMs is further studied. This work will be useful for the study of quantum non-Abelian statistics and may provide a novel way to investigate topological quantities of quantum systems.

abstract: Completely positive trace preserving maps are essential for the formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. The dynamics of quantum systems, correlated with their environments, are in general not described by such maps. We explore how this issue can be fixed by describing the classical analogue of this problem. We consider correlated probability distributions, whose subsequent system dynamics is ill-described by stochastic maps, and prescribe the correct way to describe the dynamics. We use this prescription to discuss the classical version of the second law, valid for correlated probability distributions.

abstract: From the premise that an observable is real after it is measured, we envisage a tomography-based protocol that allows us to propose a quantifier for the degree of indefiniteness of an observable given a quantum state. Then we find that reality can be inferred locally only if there is no quantum correlation in the system, i.e., quantum discord prevents Einstein's notion of separable realities. Also, by monitoring changes in the local reality upon measurements on remote systems, we are led to define a measure of nonlocality. Proved upper-bounded by discord-like correlations and requiring indefiniteness as a basic ingredient, our measure signals nonlocality even for separable states, thus revealing nonlocal aspects that are not captured by Bell inequality violations.

abstract: In this paper we focus on energy flows in simple quantum systems. This is achieved by concentrating on the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We show how this equation appears in the standard quantum formalism in essentially three different but related ways, from the standard Schr\"{o}dingier equation, from Lagrangian field theory and from the von Neumann-Moyal algebra. This equation allows us to track the energy flow using the energy-momentum tensor, the components of which are related to weak values of the four-momentum operator. This opens up a new way to explore these components empirically. The algebraic approach enables us to discuss the physical significance of the underlying non-commutative symplectic geometry, raising questions as to the structure of particles in quantum systems.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering is a form of quantum correlations and its intrinsic asymmetry makes it distinct from entanglement and Bell nonlocality. We propose here a scheme for realizing one-way Gaussian steering of two electromagnetic fields mediated by a mechanical oscillator. We reveal that the steady-state one-way steering of the intracavity and output fields is obtainable with different cavity losses or strong mechanical damping. The conditions for achieving this asymmetric steering are found, and it shows that the steering is robust against thermal mechanical fluctuations. The present scheme can realize hybrid microwave-optical asymmetric steering by optoelectromechanics. In addition, our results are generic and can also be applied to other three-mode parametrically-coupled bosonic systems.

abstract: There are several possible applications of quantum electrodynamics in dielectric media which require a quantum description for the electromagnetic field interacting with matter fields. The associated quantum models can refer to macroscopic electromagnetic fields or, in alternative, to mesoscopic fields (polarization fields) describing an effective interaction between electromagnetic field and matter fields. We adopt the latter approach, and focus on the Hopfield model for the electromagnetic field in a dielectric dispersive medium in a framework in which space-time dependent mesoscopic parameters occur, like susceptibility, matter resonance frequency, and also coupling between electromagnetic field and polarization field. Our most direct goal is to describe in a phenomenological way a space-time varying dielectric perturbation induced by means of the Kerr effect in nonlinear dielectric media. This extension of the model is implemented by means of a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian which, for constant microscopic parameters, and in the rest frame, coincides with the standard one. Moreover, we deduce a covariant scalar product and provide a covariant quantization scheme which keeps into account the constraints implicit in the model. Examples of viable applications are indicated.

abstract: Precision sensing, and in particular high precision magnetometry, is a central goal of research into quantum technologies. For magnetometers often trade-offs exist between sensitivity, spatial resolution, and frequency range. The precision, and thus the sensitivity of magnetometry scales as $1/\sqrt {T_2}$ with the phase coherence time, $T_2$, of the sensing system playing the role of a key determinant. Adapting a dynamical decoupling scheme that allows for extending $T_2$ by orders of magnitude and merging it with a magnetic sensing protocol, we achieve a measurement sensitivity even for high frequency fields close to the standard quantum limit. Using a single atomic ion as a sensor, we experimentally attain a sensitivity of $4$ pT Hz$^{-1/2}$ for an alternating-current (AC) magnetic field near 14 MHz. Based on the principle demonstrated here, this unprecedented sensitivity combined with spatial resolution in the nanometer range and tuneability from direct-current to the gigahertz range could be used for magnetic imaging in as of yet inaccessible parameter regimes.

abstract: Distilling highly entangled quantum states from weaker ones is a process that is crucial for efficient and long-distance quantum communication, and has implications for several other quantum information protocols. We introduce the notion of distillation under limited resources, and specifically focus on the energy constraint. The corresponding protocol, which we call the canonical distillation of entanglement, naturally leads to the set of canonically distillable states. We show that for non-interacting Hamiltonians, almost no states are canonically distillable, while the situation can be drastically different for interacting ones. Several paradigmatic Hamiltonians are considered for bipartite as well as multipartite canonical distillability. The results have potential applications for practical quantum communication devices.

abstract: The "folding algorithm"\cite{fold1} is a matrix product state algorithm for simulating quantum systems that involves a spatial evolution of a matrix product state. Hence, the computational effort of this algorithm is controlled by the temporal entanglement. We show that this temporal entanglement is, in many cases, equal to the spatial entanglement of a modified Hamiltonian. This inspires a modification to the folding algorithm, that we call the "hybrid algorithm". We find that this leads to improved accuracy for the same numerical effort. We then use these algorithms to study relaxation in a transverse plus parallel field Ising model, finding persistent quasi-periodic oscillations for certain choices of initial conditions.

We find that the USC system substantially modifies the coupling between the ancillary qubit and the cavity, via a counterintuitive breaking of the rotating-wave approximation which happens even for small coupling strengths.

abstract: We describe a direct method to determine the negativity of an arbitrary two-qubit state in experiments. The method is derived by analyzing the relation between the purity, negativity, and a universal entanglement witness for two-qubit entanglement. We show how the negativity of a two-qubit state can be calculated from just three experimentally accessible moments of the partially transposed density matrix of a two-photon state. Moreover, we show that the negativity can be given as a function of only six invariants, which are linear combinations of nine invariants from the complete set of 21 fundamental and independent two-qubit invariants. We analyze the relation between these moments and the concurrence for some classes of two-qubit states (including the X states, as well as pure states affected by the amplitude-damping and phase-damping channels). We also discuss the possibility of using the universal entanglement witness as an entanglement measure for various classes of two-qubit states. Moreover, we analyze how noise affects the estimation of entanglement via this witness.

abstract: Optomechanics is currently believed to provide a promising route towards the achievement of genuine quantum effects at the large, massive-system scale. By using a recently proposed figure of merit that is well suited to address continuous-variable systems, in this paper we question such expectation. We quantify the degree of macroscopicity of the state of a vibrating mechanical mode (embodied by an end-cavity cantilever or a membrane placed within an optical cavity) achieved through its radiation-pressure coupling to a quantized field of light. By showing that quite demanding conditions should be met in order to be able to claim for genuine macroscopic quantum superpositions, our investigation poses substantial doubts on the suitability of current experimental configurations in optomechanics.

abstract: Quantum gates in experiment are inherently prone to errors that need to be characterized before they can be corrected. Full characterization via quantum process tomography is impractical and often unnecessary. For most practical purposes, it is enough to estimate more general quantities such as the average fidelity. Here we use a unitary 2-design and twirling protocol for efficiently estimating the average fidelity of Clifford gates, to certify a 7-qubit entangling gate in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor. Compared with more than $10^8$ experiments required by full process tomography, we conducted 1656 experiments to satisfy a statistical confidence level of 99%. The average fidelity of this Clifford gate in experiment is 55.1%, and rises to 87.5% if the infidelity due to decoherence is removed. The entire protocol of certifying Clifford gates is efficient and scalable, and can easily be extended to any general quantum information processor with minor modifications.

abstract: We consider a family of tight-binding models based on kagome lattice with local fluxes, which have a lowest flat band in the single particle spectrum. The flat band is spanned by eigenstates forming localized loops on the lattice, with the maximally compact loop states typically breaking the discrete rotational symmetry of the lattice. When populated by locally-interacting particles, the close packing of such maximally compact loop states leads to a nematic Wigner crystal ground state. If particles are bosons, increasing filling beyond the close packing filling fraction, at the mean field level, leads to formation of nematic supersolid and a nematic superfluid phases with broken lattice rotation and $U(1)$ symmetry.

abstract: We evaluate the feasibility of using magnetic-dipole (M1) transitions in highly-charged ions as a basis of an optical atomic clockwork of exceptional accuracy. We consider a range of possibilities, including M1 transitions between clock levels of the same fine-structure and hyperfine-structure manifolds. In highly charged ions these transitions lie in the optical part of the spectra and can be probed with lasers. The most direct advantage of our proposal comes from the low degeneracy of clock levels and the simplicity of atomic structure in combination with negligible quadrupolar shift. We demonstrate that such clocks can have projected fractional accuracies below the $10^{-20}-10^{-21}$ level for all common systematic effects, such as black-body radiation, Zeeman, AC-Stark and quadrupolar shifts. Notice that usually-employed hyperfine clock transitions lie in the microwave spectral region. Our proposal moves such transitions to the optical domain. As the hyperfine transition frequencies depend on the fine-structure constant, electron-to-proton mass ratio, and nuclear magnetic moment, our proposal expands the range of experimental schemes for probing space and time variations of fundamental constants.

abstract: We predict that all-optically reconfigurable generation of photon pairs with tailored spatial entanglement can be realized via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in integrated nonlinear coupled waveguides. The required elements of the output quantum wavefunction are directly mapped from the amplitudes and phases of the classical laser pump inputs in each waveguide. This is achieved through special nonuniform domain poling, which locally inverts the sign of quadratic nonlinear susceptibility and accordingly shapes the interference of biphoton quantum states generated along the waveguides. We demonstrate a device configuration for the generation of any linear combination of two-photon Bell states.

abstract: The thermally induced coherent collapse of Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature is the dominant decay mechanism near the critical scattering length in condensates with at least partially attractive interaction. The collapse dynamics out of the ground state is mediated by a transition state whose properties determine the corresponding decay rate or lifetime of the condensate. In this paper, we perform normal form expansions of the ground and the transition state of condensates with short-range scattering interaction as well as with anisotropic and long-range dipolar interaction in a variational framework. This method allows one to determine the local properties of these states, i.e. their mean-field energy, their normal modes, the coupling between different modes, and the structure of the reaction channel to any desired order. We discuss the physical interpretation of the transition state as a certain density distribution of the atomic cloud and the behavior of the single normal form contributions in dependence on the s-wave scattering length. Moreover, we investigate the convergence of the local normal form when using extended Gaussian variational approaches, and present the condensate's decay rate.

abstract: The Riemann hypothesis, which states that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function all lie on a certain line in the complex plane, is one of the most important unresolved problems in mathematics. Inspired by the P\'olya-Hilbert conjecture, we propose a new approach to finding a physical system to study the Riemann zeros, which in contrast to previous examples, is based on applying a time-periodic driving field. This driving allows us to mould the quasienergies of the system (the analogue of the eigenenergies in the absence of driving), so that they are directly governed by the zeta function. We further show by numerical simulations that this allows the Riemann zeros to be measured in currently accessible cold atom experiments.

abstract: We develop schemes for designing pulses that implement fast and precise entangling quantum gates in superconducting qubit systems despite the presence of nearby harmful transitions. Our approach is based on purposely involving the nearest harmful transition in the quantum evolution instead of trying to avoid it. Using analytical tools, we design simple microwave control fields that implement maximally entangling gates with fidelities exceeding 99% in times as low as 40 ns. We demonstrate our approach in a two-qubit circuit QED system by designing the two most important quantum entangling gates: a conditional-NOT gate and a conditional-Z gate. Our results constitute an important step toward overcoming the problem of spectral crowding, one of the primary challenges in controlling multi-qubit systems.

abstract: We introduce a detector that selectively probes the phononic excitations of a cold Bose gas. The detector is composed of a single impurity atom confined by a double-well potential, where the two lowest eigenstates of the impurity form an effective probe qubit that is coupled to the phonons via density-density interactions with the bosons. The system is analogous to a two-level atom coupled to photons of the radiation field. We demonstrate that tracking the evolution of the qubit populations allows probing both thermal and coherent excitations in targeted phonon modes. The targeted modes are selected in both energy and momentum by adjusting the impurity's potential. We show how to use the detector to observe coherent density waves and to measure temperatures of the Bose gas down to the nano-Kelvin regime. We analyze how our scheme could be realized experimentally, including the possibility of using an array of multiple impurities to achieve greater precision from a single experimental run.

abstract: The high quantum efficiency of photosynthetic complexes has inspired researchers to explore new routes to utilize this process for photovoltaic devices. Quantum coherence has been demonstrated to play a crucial role within this process. Herein, we propose a three-dipole system as a model of a new photocell type which exploits the coherence among its three dipoles. We have proved that the efficiency of such a photocell is greatly enhanced by quantum coherence. We have also predicted that the photocurrents can be enhanced by about 49.5 % in such a coherent coupled dipole system compared with the uncoupled dipoles. These results suggest a promising novel design aspect of photosynthesis-mimicking photovoltaic devices.

abstract: The negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy center (NV) in diamond has generated significant interest as a platform for quantum information processing and sensing in the solid state. For most applications, high quality optical cavities are required to enhance the NV zero-phonon line (ZPL) emission. An outstanding challenge in maximizing the degree of NV-cavity coupling is the deterministic placement of NVs within the cavity. Here, we report photonic crystal nanobeam cavities coupled to NVs incorporated by a delta-doping technique that allows nanometer-scale vertical positioning of the emitters. We demonstrate cavities with Q up to ~24,000 and mode volume V ~ $0.47({\lambda}/n)^{3}$ as well as resonant enhancement of the ZPL of an NV ensemble with Purcell factor of ~20. Our fabrication technique provides a first step towards deterministic NV-cavity coupling using spatial control of the emitters.

abstract: For a $S=1$ system with even number of spins, the product states of two-body singlets, called the singlet pair states (SPSs), are overcomplete bases for the Hilbert space of many-body singlets. If the system contains odd number of spins, a singlet state can be decomposed as a superposition of all of the following configurations, in each configuration three of the spins form a three-body singlet and the remaining form two-body singlet pairs. This indicates that a $S=1$ spin liquid is especially a resonating-valence bond state. Although this conclusion is no longer valid for $SO(3)$ symmetric $S>1$ systems, it can be generalized to an integer spin-$S$ system if it has an enlarged $SO(2S+1)$ symmetry. Similar results can also be obtained for systems with $SU(n)$ symmetry.

abstract: We present approximate analytical method of analysis of stationary states of nonlinear quantum systems with the noise. As an example we consider quantum nonlinear oscillator excited by fluctuating force and found parameter regions with more than one stationary solutions. Existence of such region is the necessary condition for bistability. We neglect by fluctuations in the amplitude of oscillations but do not neglect by fluctuations in its phase. Then oscillator noise power spectrum depends on oscillator mean energy n, which leads to nonlinear integral equation for n. Analytical solution of this equation can be found. Stationary states of the oscillator are found for various spectrums of fluctuations of the exciting force. Linear stability analysis of stationary states was carried out.

abstract: A function of positive type can be defined as a positive functional on a convolution algebra of a locally compact group. In the case where the group is abelian, by Bochner's theorem a function of positive type is, up to normalization, the Fourier transform of a probability measure. Therefore, considering the group of translations on phase space, a suitably normalized phase-space function of positive type can be regarded as a realization of a classical state. Thus, it may be called a function of classical positive type. Replacing the ordinary convolution on phase space with the twisted convolution, one obtains a noncommutative algebra of functions whose positive functionals we may call functions of quantum positive type. In fact, by a quantum version of Bochner's theorem, a continuous function of quantum positive type is, up to normalization, the (symplectic) Fourier transform of a Wigner quasi-probability distribution; hence, it can be regarded as a phase-space realization of a quantum state. Playing with functions of positive type, classical and quantum, one is led in a natural way to consider a class of semigroups of operators, the classical-quantum semigroups. The physical meaning of these mathematical objects is unveiled via quantization, so obtaining a class of quantum dynamical semigroups that, borrowing terminology from quantum information science, may be called classical-noise semigroups.

We report experiments on 4H-SiC that investigate all-optical addressing of spin states with the zero-phonon-line transitions. Our magneto-spectroscopy results identify the spin $S=1$ structure of the ground and excited state, and a role for decay via intersystem crossing. We use these results for demonstrating coherent population trapping of spin states with divacancy ensembles that have particular orientations in the SiC crystal.

abstract: The low energy continuum limit of graphene is effectively known to be modeled using Dirac equation in (2+1) dimensions. We consider the possibility of using modulated high frequency periodic driving of a two-dimension system (optical lattice) to simulate properties of rippled graphene. We suggest that the Dirac Hamiltonian in a curved background space can also be effectively simulated by a suitable driving scheme in optical lattice. The time dependent system yields, in the approximate limit of high frequency pulsing, an effective time independent Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution, except for an initial and a final kick. We use a specific form of 4-phase pulsed forcing with suitably tuned choice of modulating operators to mimic the effects of curvature. The extent of curvature is found to be directly related to $\omega^{-1}$ the time period of the driving field at the leading order. We apply the method to engineer the effects of curved background space. We find that the imprint of curvilinear geometry modifies the electronic properties, such as LDOS, significantly. We suggest that this method shall be useful in studying the response of various properties of such systems to non-trivial geometry without requiring any actual physical deformations.

abstract: This contribution to the book in honour of J.S. Bell will probably differ from the remaining ones, in particular since only a part of it will be devoted to specific technical arguments. In fact I have considered appropriate to share with the community of physicists interested in the foundational problems of our best theory the repeated interactions I had with him in the last four years of his life, the deep discussions in which we have been involved in particular in connection with the elaboration of collapse theories and their interpretation, the contributions he gave to the development of this approach, both at a formal level, as well as championing it on repeated occasions. In brief, I intend to play here the role of one of those lucky persons who became acquainted with him personally, who has exchanged important views with him, who has learned a lot from his deep insight and conceptual lucidity, and, last but not least, one whose scientific work has been appreciated by him. Moreover, due to the fact that this book intends to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the derivation of the fundamental inequality which bears his name, I will also devote a small part of the text to recall his clear cut views about the locality issue, views that I believe have not been grasped correctly by a remarkable part of the scientific community. I will analyze this problem in quite general terms at the end of the paper.

abstract: We demonstrate for the first time coherent control of bond making, a milestone on the way to coherent control of photo-induced bimolecular chemical reactions. In strong-field multiphoton femtosecond photoassociation experiments, we find the yield of detected magnesium dimer molecules to be enhanced for positively chirped pulses and suppressed for negatively chirped pulses. Our ab initio model shows that control is achieved by purification via Franck-Condon filtering combined with chirp-dependent Raman transitions. Experimental closed-loop phase optimization using a learning algorithm yields an improved pulse that utilizes vibrational coherent dynamics in addition to chirp-dependent Raman transitions. Our results show that coherent control of binary photo-reactions is feasible even under thermal conditions.

abstract: Boundary conditions for the Maxwell and Dirac fields at material surfaces are widely-used and physically well-motivated, but do not appear to have been generalised to deal with higher spin fields. As a result there is no clear prescription as to which boundary conditions should be selected in order to obtain physically-relevant results pertaining to confined higher spin fields. This lack of understanding is significant given that boundary-dependent phenomena are ubiquitous across physics, a prominent example being the Casimir effect. Here, we use the two-spinor calculus formalism to present a unified treatment of boundary conditions routinely employed in the treatment of spin-1/2 and spin-1 fields. We then use this unification to obtain a boundary condition that can be applied to massless fields of any spin, including the spin-2 graviton, and its supersymmetric partner the spin-3/2 gravitino.

abstract: Vierbeins provide a bridge between the curved space of general relativity and the flat tangent space of special relativity. Both spaces should be causal and spin. We posit intertwining the two symmetries of spacetime bundles asymmetrically; disentangling the non-trivial Id between the base, curved space as a locally ringed space and its Zariski (co-)tangent space. This involves the introduction of a "two-sided vector space" as a section of the smooth, stratified diffeomorphism bundle of spacetime. A change of paradigm from the fiber bundle approach ensues where the bundle space takes an active role and the group actions are implemented through asymmetric "scalar multiplication" by elements of a skewed K-algebra on a free K-bimodule. Accordingly, the left action is augmented from that on the right algebraically by a left-sided algebra automorphism via a left alpha-derivation as a non-central Ore extension of a Weyl algebra. Curiously, summoning the left $\alpha$-derivation in the context of spacetime symmetries may constitute the key to an asymmetric quantization of the theory. Furthermore, it is conjectured that causal and spin structure may be endowed upon the spacetime itself, independently of the tangent space structure.

abstract: In the present paper, we have investigated the role of cosmic string on spin current and Hall electric field. Due to the background cosmic string, the modified electric field of the system generates renormalized spin orbit coupling, which induces a modified non-Abelian gauge field. The defect causes a change in the AB and AC phases appearing due to the modified electromagnetic field. In addition, for a time varying electric field we perform explicit analytic calculations to derive the exact form of spin electric field and spin current, which is defect parameter dependent and of oscillating type. Furthermore, in an asymmetric crystal within the Drude model approach we investigate the dependence of the cosmic string parameters on cosmic string induced Hall electric field.

abstract: We study the Schr\"odinger operator with a potential given by the sum of the potentials for harmonic oscillator and imaginary cubic oscillator and we focus on its pseudospectral properties. A summary of known results about the operator and its spectrum is provided and the importance of examining its pseudospectrum as well is emphasized. This is achieved by employing scaling techniques and treating the operator using semiclassical methods. The existence of pseudoeigenvalues very far from the spectrum is proven, and as a consequence, the spectrum of the operator is unstable with respect to small perturbations and the operator cannot be similar to a self-adjoint operator via a bounded and boundedly invertible transformation. It is shown that its eigenfunctions form a complete set in the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions; however, they do not form a Schauder basis.

We obtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of this model by using the tilting transformation and the squeezed number states of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. We show that in the non-relativistic limit, this model can be mapped onto the degenerate parametric amplifier

abstract: The concepts of superposition and of transition probability, familiar from pure states in quantum physics, are extended to locally normal states on funnels of type I$_\infty$ factors. Such funnels are used in the description of infinite systems, appearing for example in quantum field theory or in quantum statistical mechanics; their respective constituents are interpreted as algebras of observables localized in an increasing family of nested spacetime regions. Given a generic reference state (expectation functional) on a funnel, e.g, a ground state or a thermal equilibrium state, it is shown that irrespective of the global type of this state all of its excitations, generated by the adjoint action of elements of the funnel, can coherently be superimposed in a meaningful manner. Moreover, these states are the extreme points of their convex hull and as such are analogues of pure states. As further support of this analogy, transition probabilities are defined, complete families of orthogonal states are exhibited and a one-to-one correspondence between the states and families of minimal projections on a Hilbert space is established. The physical interpretation of these quantities relies on a concept of primitive observables. It extends the familiar framework of observable algebras and avoids some counter intuitive features of that setting. Primitive observables admit a consistent statistical interpretation of corresponding measurements and their impact on states is described by a variant of the von Neumann-L\"uders projection postulate.

abstract: A novel interpretation is given of Dirac's "wave equation for the relativistic electron" as a quantum-mechanical one-particle equation. In this interpretation the electron and the positron are merely the two different "topological spin" states of a single more fundamental particle, not distinct particles in their own right. The new interpretation is backed up by the existence of such curious binary particle structures in general relativity, in particular the spacetime singularity of the maximal analytically extended, topologically non-trivial, electromagnetic Kerr--Newman spacetime in the zero-gravity limit (here, "zero-gravity" means the limit $G\to 0$, where $G$ is Newton's constant of universal gravitation). This novel interpretation resolves the dilemma that Dirac's wave equation seems to be capable of describing both the electron and the positron in "external" fields in many relevant situations (certainly not in all!), while the bi-spinorial wave function has only a single position variable in its argument, not two --- as it should if it were a two-particle equation! The pertinent general-relativistic zero-gravity Hydrogen problem is studied in the usual Born--Oppenheimer approximation. Its spectral results suggest that the zero-$G$ Kerr--Newman magnetic moment be identified with the so-called "anomalous magnetic moment of the physical electron," not with the Bohr magneton, so that the ring radius is only a tiny fraction of the electron's Compton wave length.

We first optimize variations of the torch scan length using the flame-brush method for fabricating TOFs with taper angles that satisfy the adiabaticity criteria. We accordingly fabricate TOFs with optimal shapes and compare their transmission to TOFs with a constant taper angle and TOFs with an exponential shape. The highest transmission measured for TOFs with an optimal shape is in excess of 99.7 % with a total TOF length of only 23 mm, whereas TOFs with a constant taper angle of 2 mrad reach 99.6 % transmission for a 63 mm TOF length.

abstract: As a part of the program `discrete quantum mechanics,' we present general reflectionless potentials for difference Schr\"odinger equations with pure imaginary shifts. By combining contiguous integer wave number reflectionless potentials, we construct the discrete analogues of the $h(h+1)/\cosh^2x$ potential with the integer $h$, which belong to the recently constructed families of solvable dynamics having the $q$-ultraspherical polynomials with $|q|=1$ as the main part of the eigenfunctions. For the general ($h\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}$) scattering theory for these potentials, we need the connection formulas for the basic hypergeometric function ${}_2\phi_1(\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{a,b}{c}|q;z)$ with $|q|=1$, which is not known. The connection formulas are expected to contain the quantum dilogarithm functions as the $|q|=1$ counterparts of the $q$-gamma functions. We propose a conjecture of the connection formula of the ${}_2\phi_1$ function with $|q|=1$. Based on the conjecture, we derive the transmission and reflection amplitudes, which have all the desirable properties. They provide a strong support to the conjectured connection formula.

abstract: Single quantum emitters (SQEs) are at the heart of quantum optics and photonic quantum information technologies. To date, all demonstrated solid-state single-photon sources are confined in three-dimensional materials. Here, we report a new class of SQEs based on excitons that are spatially localized by defects in two-dimensional tungsten-diselenide monolayers. The optical emission from these SQEs shows narrow linewidths of ~0.13 meV, about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of delocalized valley excitons. Second-order correlation measurements reveal strong photon anti-bunching, unambiguously establishing the single photon nature of the emission. The SQE emission shows two non-degenerate transitions, which are cross-linearly polarized. We assign this fine structure to two excitonic eigen-modes whose degeneracy is lifted by a large ~0.71 meV coupling, likely due to the electron-hole exchange interaction in presence of anisotropy. Magneto-optical measurements also reveal an exciton g-factor of ~8.7, several times larger than that of delocalized valley excitons. In addition to their fundamental importance, establishing new SQEs in 2D quantum materials could give rise to practical advantages in quantum information processing, such as efficient photon extraction and high integratability and scalability.

abstract: We study the influence of a background uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on the vacuum of a quantized charged spinor matter field confined between two parallel neutral plates; the magnetic field is directed orthogonally to the plates. The admissible set of boundary conditions at the plates is determined by the requirement that the Dirac Hamiltonian operator be self-adjoint. It is shown that, in the case of a sufficiently strong magnetic field and a sufficiently large separation of the plates, the generalized Casimir force is repulsive, being independent of the choice of a boundary condition, as well as of the distance between the plates. The detection of this effect seems to be feasible in the foreseeable future.

abstract: We consider thermalization of a microscopic quantum system by interaction with a thermal bath. Our interest is the minimal size the bath can have while still being able to thermalize the system. Within a specific thermalization scheme we show that a single spin-1/2 can be fully thermalized by interaction with a bath that consists of just two other spin-1/2. The two bath spins are initially in a pure, entangled state, and the thermalizing interaction is a Heisenberg exchange-interaction of the system-spin with one of the bath spins. The time dependent coupling strength has to obey a single integral constraint. We also present a simple generalization of this minimal model in which the bath consists of an arbitrary number of spin-1/2 pairs.

abstract: We derive and analyze an effective quantum Boltzmann equation in the kinetic regime for the interactions of four distinguishable types of fermionic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles, starting from a general quantum field Hamiltonian. Each particle type is described by a time-dependent, $2 \times 2$ spin-density ("Wigner") matrix. We show that density and energy conservation laws as well as the H-theorem hold, and enumerate additional conservation laws depending on the interaction. The conserved quantities characterize the $t \to \infty$ thermal (Fermi-Dirac) equilibrium state. We illustrate the approach to equilibrium by numerical simulations in the isotropic three-dimensional setting.

abstract: We demonstrate an elastically-tunable self-assembled quantum dot in a nanowire antenna that emits single photons with resolution-limited spectral linewidths. The single-photon device is comprised of a single quantum dot embedded in a top-down fabricated nanowire waveguide integrated onto a piezoelectric actuator. Non-resonant excitation leads to static (fluctuating) charges likely at the nanowire surface, causing DC Stark shifts (inhomogeneous broadening); for low excitation powers, the effects are not observed and resolution-limited linewidths are obtained. Despite significant strain-field relaxation in the high-aspect-ratio nanowires, we achieve up to 1.2 meV tuning of a dot's transition energy. Single-photon sources with high brightness, resolution-limited linewidths, and wavelength tunability are promising for future quantum technologies.

abstract: We demonstrate the control of quantum tunneling in an ultracold lattice gas by the measurement backaction imposed by an imaging process. A {\em in situ} imaging technique is used to acquire repeated images of an ultracold gas confined in a shallow optical lattice. The backaction induced by these position measurements modifies the coherent quantum tunneling of atoms within the lattice. By smoothly varying the rate at which spatial information is extracted from the atomic ensemble, we observe the continuous crossover from the 'weak measurement regime' where position measurements have little influence on the tunneling dynamics, to the 'strong measurement regime' where measurement-induced localization causes a large suppression of tunneling. This suppression of coherent tunneling is a manifestation of the Quantum Zeno effect. Our study realizes an experimental demonstration of the paradigmatic Heisenberg microscope in a lattice gas and sheds light on the implications of quantum measurement on the coherent evolution of a mesoscopic quantum system. In addition, this demonstrates a powerful technique for the control of an interacting many-body quantum system via spatially resolved measurement backaction.

abstract: We study a discrete Schr\"odinger equation with arbitrary long range hopping terms under the influence of an external force. The impact of long range hoppings on the single particle Bloch dynamics in the lattice is investigated. A closed expression for the propagator is given, based on which we analyze the dynamics of initially Gaussian wave packets. Our findings capture the anharmonic oscillations recently observed in zigzag lattices and furthermore provide a detailed quantitative description of the crossover between center of mass Bloch oscillations for wide wave packets and left-right symmetric width oscillations for narrow single site excitations. The analytical results are shown to be in agreement with numerical simulations. A helix lattice setup for ultracold atoms is proposed where such hopping terms to far neighbors can be experimentally tuned to sizable values.

abstract: Our results concern quantum chaos of the vacuum Bianchi IX model. We apply the equilateral triangle potential well approximation to the potential of the Bianchi IX model to solve the eigenvalue problem for the physical Hamiltonian. Such approximation is well satisfied in vicinity of the cosmic singularity. Level spacing distribution of the eigenvalues is studied with and without applying the unfolding procedure. In both cases, the obtained distributions are qualitatively described by Brody's distribution with the parameter $\beta\approx0.3$, revealing some sort of the level repulsion. The observed repulsion may reflect chaotic nature of the classical dynamics of the Bianchi IX universe. However, full understanding of this effects will require examination of the Bianchi IX model with the exact potential.

abstract: The question how to Lorentz transform an N-particle wave function naturally leads to the concept of a so-called multi-time wave function, i.e. a map from (space-time)^N to a spin space. This concept was originally proposed by Dirac as the basis of relativistic quantum mechanics. In such a view, interaction potentials are mathematically inconsistent. This fact motivates the search for new mechanisms for relativistic interactions. In this paper, we explore the idea that relativistic interaction can be described by boundary conditions on the set of coincidence points of two particles in space-time. This extends ideas from zero-range physics to a relativistic setting. We illustrate the idea at the simplest model which still possesses essential physical properties like Lorentz invariance and a positive definite density: two-time equations for mass-less Dirac particles in 1+1 dimensions. In order to deal with a spatio-temporally non-trivial domain, a necessity in the multi-time picture, we develop a new method to prove existence and uniqueness of classical solutions: a generalized version of the method of characteristics. Both mathematical and physical considerations are combined to precisely formulate and answer the questions of probability conservation, Lorentz invariance, interaction and antisymmetry.

abstract: Macro properties of cold atomic gases are driven by few-body correlations, even if the gas has thousands of particles. Quantum systems composed of two and three particles with attractive zero\=/range pairwise interactions are considered for general masses and interaction strengths in two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). The Faddeev decomposition is used to derive the equations for the bound state, which is the starting point for the investigation of universal properties of few\=/body systems, i.e. those that all potentials with the same physics at low energy are able to describe in a model\=/independent form. In 2D, the number of bound states in a three\=/body system increases without bound as the mass of one particle becomes much lighter than the other two. The analytic form of an effective potential between the heavy particles explains the mass\=/dependence on the number of bound energy levels. An exact analytic expression for the large\=/momentum asymptotic behaviour of the spectator function in the Faddeev equation is presented. The spectator function and its asymptotic form define the two- and three\=/body contact parameters. The two\=/body parameter is found to be independent of the quantum state in some specific 2D systems. The 2D and 3D momentum distributions have a distinct sub\=/leading form whereas the 3D term depends on the mass of the particles. A model that interpolates between 2D and 3D is proposed and a sharp transition in the energy spectrum of three-body systems is found.

abstract: The most common method for calculating accurate numerical solutions for complicated linear differential equations - for example, finding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schrodinger equation for many-electron atoms - is the variational method with some convenient basis of functions. This leads to a finite matrix representation of the operators involved; and standard numerical operations - such as Gaussian elimination - may be employed. When the basis functions are not orthogonal, one expects substantial loss of numerical accuracy in those matrix manipulations; and so multiple-precision arithmetic is often required for useful results. In this paper, for the first time, we offer a way to estimate the rate at which numerical cancellations will grow in severity as one increases the basis size. For the familiar case of using simple power series, x^n, n<N as the basis instead of orthogonal polynomials, we predict a loss of about 2N bits or 4N bits of numerical accuracy.

abstract: We theoretically establish the mean-field phase diagram of a homogeneous spin-$1$, spin-orbit coupled Bose gas as a function of the spin-dependent interaction parameter, the Raman coupling strength and the quadratic Zeeman shift. We find that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and spin-dependent interactions leads to the occurrence of ferromagnetic or ferronematic phases which also break translational symmetry. For weak Raman coupling, increasing attractive spin-dependent interactions (as in $^{87}$Rb or $^7$Li) induces a transition from a uniform to a stripe XY ferromagnet (with no nematic order). For repulsive spin-dependent interactions however (as in $^{23}$Na), we find a transition from an $XY$ spin spiral phase ($<S_{z} >= 0$ and uniform total density) with uniaxial nematic order, to a biaxial ferronematic, where the total density, spin vector and nematic director oscillate in real space. We investigate the stability of these phases against the quadratic Zeeman effect, which generally tends to favor uniform phases with either ferromagnetic or nematic order but not both. We discuss the relevance of our results to ongoing experiments on spin-orbit coupled, spinor Bose gases.

abstract: Starting from degree N solutions of a time dependent Schroedinger-like equation for classical orthogonal polynomials, a linear matrix equation describing perturbations around the N zeros of the polynomial is derived. The matrix has remarkable Diophantine properties. Its eigenvalues are independent of the zeros. The corresponding eigenvectors provide the representations of the lower degree (0,1,...,N-1) polynomials in terms of the zeros of the degree N polynomial. The results are valid universally for all the classical orthogonal polynomials, including the Askey scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and its q-analogues.

abstract: A semiconductor nanowire based superconductor-normal-superconductor (SNS) junction is modeled theoretically. A magnetic field is applied along the nanowire axis, parallel to the current. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for Andreev bound states are solved while considering the electronic subbands due to radial confinement in the N-section. It is seen that the energy-versus-phase curves of the Andreev bound states are shifted in phase, as the N-section Andreev quasiparticles with orbital angular momentum couple to the axial magnetic flux. A similar phase shift is observed in the continuum current of the junction. An intuitive, semi-classical picture is presented to complement the quantum mechanical calculation. The critical current of the junction is numerically studied when multiple subbands carrying orbital angular momentum are occupied. Oscillations of the critical current versus the axial magnetic flux are identified as a novel form of Josephson interference. Regimes are identified in which this effect is prominently visible.

The 162Dy BEC reported is an order of magnitude larger in atom number than that of the previously reported 164Dy BEC, and it may be produced within 18 s.

abstract: We propose and analyze a scheme for parametrically cooling bilayer cuprates based on the selective driving of a $c$-axis vibrational mode. The scheme exploits the vibration as a transducer making the Josephson plasma frequencies time-dependent. We show how modulation at the difference frequency between the intra- and interbilayer plasmon substantially suppresses interbilayer phase fluctuations, responsible for switching $c$-axis transport from a superconducting to resistive state. Our calculations indicate that this may provide a viable mechanism for stabilizing non-equilibrium superconductivity even above $T_c$, provided a finite pair density survives between the bilayers out of equilibrium.

We discuss here the addition of a new discrete variable that measures the degree of the Hermite functions and allows to obtain the projective algebra io(2). A Rigged Hilbert space is found and a new discrete basis in R obtained. The operators {O[R]} defined on R are shown to belong to the Universal Enveloping Algebra UEA[io(2)] allowing, in this way, their algebraic discussion. Introducing in the half-line a Fourier-like Transform, the procedure is extended to R^+ and can be easily generalized to R^n and to spherical reference systems.

abstract: Free-space quantum key distribution links in urban environment have demanding operating needs, such as functioning in daylight and under atmospheric turbulence, which can dramatically impact their performance. Both effects are usually mitigated with a careful design of the field of view of the receiver. However, a trade-off is often required, since a narrow field of view improves background noise rejection but it is linked to an increase in turbulence-related losses. In this paper, we present a high-speed automatic tracking system to overcome these limitations. Both a reduction in the field-of-view to decrease the background noise and the mitigation of the losses caused by atmospheric turbulence are addressed. Two different designs are presented and discussed, along with technical considerations for the experimental implementation. Finally, preliminary experimental results of beam wander correction are used to estimate the potential improvement of both the quantum bit error rate and secret key rate of a free space quantum key distribution system.

abstract: Phase transitions are ubiquitous in our three-dimensional world. By contrast most conventional transitions do not occur in infinite uniform two-dimensional systems because of the increased role of thermal fluctuations. Here we explore the dimensional crossover of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for a weakly interacting atomic gas confined in a novel quasi-two-dimensional geometry, with a flat in-plane trap bottom. We detect the onset of an extended phase coherence, using velocity distribution measurements and matter-wave interferometry. We relate this coherence to the transverse condensation phenomenon, in which a significant fraction of atoms accumulate in the ground state of the motion perpendicular to the atom plane. We also investigate the dynamical aspects of the transition through the detection of topological defects that are nucleated in a quench cooling of the gas, and we compare our results to the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek theory for the conventional BEC second-order phase transition.

abstract: The Kronig-Penney model describes what happens to electron states when a confining potential is repeated indefinitely. This model uses a square well potential; the energies and eigenstates can be obtained analytically for a the single well, and then Bloch's Theorem allows one to extend these solutions to the periodically repeating square well potential. In this work we describe how to obtain simple numerical solutions for the eigenvalues and eigenstates for any confining potential within a unit cell, and then extend this procedure, with virtually no extra effort, to the case of periodically repeating potentials. In this way one can study the band structure effects which arise from differently-shaped potentials. One of these effects is the electron-hole mass asymmetry. More realistic unit cell potentials generally give rise to higher electron-hole mass asymmetries.

abstract: Localization effects and quantum decoherence driven by the mass-eigenstate wave packet propagation are shown to support a statistical correlation between quantum entanglement and damped oscillations in the scenario of three-flavor quantum mixing for neutrinos. Once the mass-eigenstates that support flavor oscillations are identified as three-{\em qubit} modes, a decoherence scale can be extracted from correlation quantifiers, namely the entanglement of formation and the logarithmic negativity. Such a decoherence scale is compared with the coherence length of damped oscillations. Damping signatures exhibited by flavor transition probabilities as an effective averaging of the oscillating terms are then explained as owing to loss of entanglement between mass modes involved in the relativistic propagation.

abstract: We develop and present an improvement to the conventional technique for solving the Hierarchical Equations of Motion which reduces the memory cost by more than 75% while retaining the same convergence rate and accuracy. This allows for a full calculation of the population dynamics of the 24-site FMO trimer for long timescales with very little effort, and we present the first fully converged, exact results for the 7-site subsystem of the monomer, and for the full 24-site trimer. Owing to this new approach, our numerically exact 24-site, 2-exponential results are the most demanding HEOM calculations performed to date, surpassing the 50-site, 1-exponential results of Strumpfer and Schulten [2012, J. Chem. Thy. & Comp., 8, 2808]. We then show where our exact 7-site results deviate from the approximation of Ishizaki and Fleming [2009, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 106, 17255]. Our exact results are then compared to calculations using the incoherent Forster theory, and it is found that the energy transfer from the antenna to the reaction center occurs more than 50 times faster than the fluorescence lifetime of the excitation, whether or not coherence is considered. This means that coherence is not likely to improve the efficiency of the photosynthesis. In fact, the incoherent theory often tends to over-predict the rates of energy transfer, suggesting that in some cases electronic coherence may actually slow down the photosynthetic process.

abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of atomic collisions on the phase transition form the normal to the superradiant phase in a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped inside an optical cavity. Specifically, we show that driving the atoms from the side of the cavity leads to the excitation of modes in the edges of the first Brillouin zone of every energy band, which results in the two-mode approximation of the BEC matter field in the limit of weak coupling regime. The nonlinear effect of atom-atom interaction shifts the threshold of the quantum phase transition of the BEC and also affect the power low behavior of quantum fluctuations in the total particle number. Besides, we show the possibility of controlling the quantum phase transition of the system through the s-wave scattering frequency when the the strength of the transverse pumping has been fixed.

abstract: In pioneering papers \cite{ESY84,Gh06}, the concept of the {\em promise problems} was introduced and started to be systematically explored. It has been argued that promise problems should be seen as partial {\em decision problems} and as such that they are more fundamental than decision problems and formal languages that used to be considered as the basic ones for complexity theory issues explorations. Moreover, both of the above papers explored and summarized \cite{Gh06}, in some depth and systematically, promise problems in the context of the theory of the main computational complexity classes as well as in the context of cracking out the public key cryptography. In the present paper a variety of issues is explored concerning promise problems on the level of classical, quantum and also semi-quantum finite automata. Two acceptance modes, {\em recognizability} and {\em solvability} are introduced and their basic properties are explored. This is also to capture and explore the case that even if a promise is simple (say regular), its disjoint subsets, for so called yes and no cases, do not have to be so. In addition, several results concerning descriptional complexity impacts on outcomes of some operations on promise problems are shown and the increasing power of quantum versus classical automata is demonstrated when dealing with some promise problems.

abstract: We investigate the entanglement and the R\'enyi entropies of two electronic leads connected by a quantum point contact. For non-interacting electrons, the entropies can be related to the cumulants of the full counting statistics of transferred charge which in principle are measurable. We consider the entanglement entropy generated by operating the quantum point contact as a quantum switch which is opened and closed in a periodic manner. Using a numerically exact approach we analyze the conditions under which a logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy predicted by conformal field theory should be observable in an electronic conductor. In addition, we consider clean single-particle excitations on top of the Fermi sea (levitons) generated by applying designed pulses to the leads. We identify a Hong-Ou-Mandel-like suppression of the entanglement entropy by interfering two levitons on a quantum point contact tuned to half transmission.

abstract: Quantum walks on translation invariant regular graphs spread quadratically faster than their classical counterparts. The same coherence that gives them this quantum speedup inhibits, or even stops their spread in the presence of disorder. We ask how to create an efficient transport channel from a fixed source site (A) to fixed target site (B) in a disordered 2-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk by cutting some of the links. We show that the somewhat counterintuitive strategy of cutting links along a single line connecting A to B creates such a channel. The efficient transport along the cut is due to topologically protected chiral edge states, which exist even though the bulk Chern number in this system vanishes. We give a realization of the walk as a periodically driven lattice Hamiltonian, and identify the bulk topological invariant responsible for the edge states as the quasienergy winding of this Hamiltonian.

abstract: That the speed of light in free space is constant is a cornerstone of modern physics. However, light beams have finite transverse size, which leads to a modification of their wavevectors resulting in a change to their phase and group velocities. We study the group velocity of single photons by measuring a change in their arrival time that results from changing the beam's transverse spatial structure. Using time-correlated photon pairs we show a reduction of the group velocity of photons in both a Bessel beam and photons in a focused Gaussian beam. In both cases, the delay is several microns over a propagation distance of the order of 1 m. Our work highlights that, even in free space, the invariance of the speed of light only applies to plane waves. Introducing spatial structure to an optical beam, even for a single photon, reduces the group velocity of the light by a readily measurable amount.

abstract: We compute the transmission probability through rectangular potential barriers and p-n junctions in the presence of a magnetic and electric fields in bilayer graphene taking into account the full four bands of the energy spectrum. For energy E higher than the interlayer coupling $\gamma_1 (E>\gamma_1)$ two propagation modes are available for transport giving rise to four possible ways for transmission and reflection probabilities. However, when the energy is less then the height of the barrier the Dirac fermions exhibits transmission resonances and only one mode of propagation is available. We study the effect of the interlayer electrostatic potential $\delta$ and the different geometry parameters of the barrier on the transmission probability.

abstract: We consider nonadiabatic transitions in explicitly time-dependent systems with Hamiltonians of the form $\hat{H}(t) = \hat{A} +\hat{B} t + \hat{C}/t$, where $t$ is time and $\hat{A}$, $\hat{B}$, $\hat{C}$ are Hermitian $N\times N$ matrices. We show that in any model of this type, scattering matrix elements satisfy nontrivial exact constraints that follow from the absence of the Stokes phenomenon for solutions with specific conditions at $t \rightarrow -\infty$. This allows one to continue such solutions analytically to $t \rightarrow +\infty$, and connect their asymptotic behavior at $t \rightarrow -\infty$ and $t \rightarrow +\infty$. This property becomes particularly useful when a model shows additional discrete symmetries. In particular, we derive a number of simple exact constraints and explicit expressions for scattering probabilities in such systems.

As an example, various superpositions of vibrational states of the $K_2$ molecule are shown.

abstract: We present several ideas in direction of physical interpretation of $q$- and $f$-oscillators as a nonlinear oscillators. First we show that an arbitrary one dimensional integrable system in action-angle variables can be naturally represented as a classical and quantum $f$-oscillator. As an example, the semi-relativistic oscillator as a descriptive of the Landau levels for relativistic electron in magnetic field is solved as an $f$-oscillator. By using dispersion relation for $q$-oscillator we solve the linear q-Schr\"odinger equation and corresponding nonlinear complex q-Burgers equation. The same dispersion allows us to construct integrable q-NLS model as a deformation of cubic NLS in terms of recursion operator of NLS hierarchy. Peculiar property of the model is to be completely integrable at any order of expansion in deformation parameter around $q=1$. As another variation on the theme, we consider hydrodynamic flow in bounded domain. For the flow bounded by two concentric circles we formulate the two circle theorem and construct solution as the q-periodic flow by non-symmetric $q$-calculus. Then we generalize this theorem to the flow in the wedge domain bounded by two arcs. This two circular-wedge theorem determines images of the flow by extension of $q$-calculus to two bases: the real one, corresponding to circular arcs and the complex one, with $q$ as a primitive root of unity. As an application, the vortex motion in annular domain as a nonlinear oscillator in the form of classical and quantum f-oscillator is studied. Extending idea of q-oscillator to two bases with the golden ratio, we describe Fibonacci numbers as a special type of $q$-numbers with matrix Binet formula. We derive the corresponding golden quantum oscillator, nonlinear coherent states and Fock-Bargman representation.

abstract: Addition plays a central role in mathematics and physics, while adders are ubiquitous devices in computation and electronics. In this sense, usual sum operations can be realized by classical Turing machines and also, with a suitable algorithm, by quantum Turing machines. Moreover, the sum of state vectors in the same Hilbert space, known as quantum superposition, is at the core of quantum physics. In fact, entanglement and the promised exponential speed-up of quantum computing are based on such superpositions. Here, we consider the existence of a quantum adder, defined as a unitary operation mapping two unknown quantum states encoded in different quantum systems onto their sum codified in a single one. The surprising answer is that this quantum adder is forbidden and it has the quantum cloning machine as a special case. This no-go result is of fundamental nature and its deep implications should be further studied.

abstract: Quantum trajectories and superoperator algorithms implemented within the matrix product state (MPS) framework are powerful tools to simulate the real-time dynamics of open dissipative quantum systems. As for the unitary case, the reachable time-scales as well as system sizes are limited by the (possible) build-up of entanglement entropy. The aforementioned methods constitute complementary approaches how Lindblad master equations can be integrated relying either on a quasi-exact representation of the full density matrix or a stochastic unraveling of the density matrix in terms of pure states. In this work, we systematically benchmark both methods by studying the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard chain in the presence of local as well as global dephasing. The build-up as well as system-size scaling of entanglement entropy strongly depends on the method and the parameter regime and we discuss the applicability of the methods for these cases as well as study the distribution of observables and time discretization errors that can become a limiting factor for global dissipation.

abstract: We discuss the U(1)-Higgs model in two dimensions in the strongly coupled regime. If we neglect the plaquette interactions, we generate an effective theory where link variables are integrated out, producing 4-field operators. Plaquette interactions can be restored order by order as in recent calculations with staggered fermions. In the case of a SU(2) gauge theory with fermions, this strong coupling expansion can be related to the strong coupling expansion of Fermi-Hubbard models possibly implementable on optical lattice. We would like to provide a similar construction relating the U(1)-Higgs model to some Bose-Hubbard model. As a first step in this direction, we discuss a recent proposal to implement the O(2) model on optical lattices using a 87Rb and 41K Bose-Bose mixture of cold atoms.

abstract: We present a comprehensive introduction to spacetime algebra that emphasizes its practicality and power as a tool for the study of electromagnetism. We carefully develop this natural (Clifford) algebra of the Minkowski spacetime geometry, with a particular focus on its intrinsic (and often overlooked) complex structure. Notably, the scalar imaginary that appears throughout the electromagnetic theory properly corresponds to the unit 4-volume of spacetime itself, and thus has physical meaning. The electric and magnetic fields are combined into a single complex and frame-independent bivector field, which generalizes the Riemann-Silberstein complex vector that has recently resurfaced in studies of the single photon wavefunction. The complex structure of spacetime also underpins the emergence of electromagnetic waves, circular polarizations, the normal variables for canonical quantization, the distinction between electric and magnetic charge, complex spinor representations of Lorentz transformations, and the dual (electric-magnetic field exchange) symmetry that produces helicity conservation in vacuum fields. This latter symmetry manifests as an arbitrary global phase of the complex field, motivating the use of a complex vector potential, along with an associated transverse and gauge-invariant bivector potential, as well as complex (bivector and scalar) Hertz potentials. Our detailed treatment aims to encourage the use of spacetime algebra as a readily available and mature extension to existing vector calculus and tensor methods that can greatly simplify the analysis of fundamentally relativistic objects like the electromagnetic field.

abstract: The branching fractions from the excited state $6P_{1/2}$ of singly charged barium ion has been measured with a precision $0.05%$ in an ion trap experiment. This measurement along with the known value of the upper state life-time allowed the determination of the dipole matrix elements for the transitions $P-S$ and $P-D$ to below one percent level. Therefore, for the first time it is now possible to compare the many body calculations of these matrix elements at level which is of significance to any parity non-conservation experiment on barium ion. Moreover, these dipole matrix elements are the most significant contributors to the parity violating matrix element between the $S-D$ transition, contributing upto $90%$ to the total. Our results on the dipole matrix elements are $3.306\pm0.014$ and $3.036\pm0.016$ for the $S-P$ and $P-D$ transitions respectively.

Thanks to the formulation in terms of the pseudo-deformation, the connection from the su(2)-based Richardson-Gaudin model towards the Dicke model can be performed adiabatically.

abstract: We consider the non-equilibrium dynamics in isolated systems, described by quantum field theories (QFTs). After being prepared in a density matrix that is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, such systems are expected to relax locally to a stationary state. In a presence of local conservation laws, these stationary states are believed to be described by appropriate generalized Gibbs ensembles. Here we demonstrate that in order to obtain a correct description of the stationary state, it is necessary to take into account conservation laws that are not (ultra-)local in the usual sense of QFT, but fulfil a significantly weaker form of locality. We discuss implications of our results for integrable QFTs in one spatial dimension.

abstract: We use laser-cooled ion Coulomb crystals in the well-controlled environment of a harmonic radiofrequency ion trap to investigate phase transitions and defect formation. Topological defects in ion Coulomb crystals (kinks) have been recently proposed for studies of nonlinear physics with solitons and as carriers of quantum information. Defects form when a symmetry breaking phase transition is crossed nonadiabatically. For a second order phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts that the formation of these defects follows a power law scaling in the rate of the transition. We demonstrate a scaling of defect density and describe kink dynamics and stability. We further discuss the implementation of mass defects and electric fields as first steps toward controlled kink preparation and manipulation.

We demonstrate the coupling of an atomic ensemble to the cavity in both configurations. The atoms are confined either within an intracavity far-off-resonance optical dipole trap (FORT) or a crossed optical dipole trap via transversely oriented lasers. Multimode cavity QED provides fully emergent and dynamical optical lattices for intracavity BECs. Such systems will enable explorations of quantum soft matter, including superfluid smectics, superfluid glasses, and spin glasses as well as neuromorphic associative memory.

abstract: We propose to experimentally realize an odd parity eigenstate $\left\vert b\right\rangle $ of two atoms in the double well. The occupation probability of this state shows evident dependence on the interaction, distinct from the result of two-mode model adopted in the Heidelberg experiment. The tunneling dynamics of two atoms starting from the $NOON$ state with infinite barrier height can be derived from the exactly solved model of $\delta $-barrier split double well based on a Bethe ansatz type hypothesis of the wave functions. We find that the single particle tunneling transfer the probabilities between double occupancy and single occupancy of each well.

abstract: We investigate continuous-time quantum walks of two indistinguishable anyons in one-dimensional lattices with both on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions based on the fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation. It is shown that the two-body correlations in position space are symmetric about the initial sites of two quantum walkers in the Bose limit ($\chi=0$ ) and Fermi limit ( $\chi=1$), while in momentum space this happens only in the Bose limit. An interesting asymmetry arises in the correlation for most cases with the statistical parameter $\chi$ varying in between. It turns out that the origin of this asymmetry comes from the fractional statistics that anyons obey. On the other hand, the two-body correlations of hard-core anyons in position spaceshow uniform behaviors from anti-bunching to co-walking regardless of the statistical parameter. The momentum correlations in the case of strong interaction undergo a smooth process of two stripes smoothly merging into a single one, i.e. the evolution of fermions into hard-core bosons.

abstract: We demonstrate squeezing of a strongly interacting opto-electromechanical system using a parametric drive. By employing real-time feedback on the phase of the pump at twice the resonance frequency the thermo-mechanical noise is squeezed beyond the 3 dB instability limit. Surprisingly, this method can also be used to generate highly nonlinear states. We show that using the parametric drive with feedback on, classical number-like and cat-like states can be prepared. This presents a valuable electro-optomechanical state-preparation protocol that is extendable to the quantum regime.

abstract: The optical interaction of light and matter is modeled as an oscillating dipole in a plane wave. We analyze absorption, scattering and extinction for this system by the energy flow, which is depicted by streamlines of the Poynting vector. Depending on the dissipative damping of the oscillator, the streamlines end up in the dipole. Based on a graphical investigation of the streamlines, this represents the absorption cross section, and forms a far-field absorption aperture. In the near-field of the oscillator, a modification of the aperture is observed. This scheme can be adapted to a single dipolar emitter, interacting with a light field. In the case of the absorption by a single atom, where the oscillator has a circular dipole characteristics, we model the energy flow and derive the apertures.

abstract: The strongest evidence for superiority of quantum annealing on spin glass problems has come from comparing simulated quantum annealing using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to simulated classical annealing [G. Santoro et al., Science 295, 2427(2002)]. Motivated by experiments on programmable quantum annealing devices we revisit the question of when quantum speedup may be expected for Ising spin glass problems. We find that even though a better scaling compared to simulated classical annealing can be achieved for QMC simulations, this advantage is due to time discretization and measurements which are not possible on a physical quantum annealing device. QMC simulations in the physically relevant continuous time limit, on the other hand, do not show superiority. Our results imply that care has to be taken when using QMC simulations to assess quantum speedup potential and are consistent with recent arguments that no quantum speedup should be expected for two-dimensional spin glass problems.

abstract: Combining superconducting qubits with mesoscopic devices that carry topological states of matter may lead to compact and improved qubit devices with properties useful for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Recently, a charge qubit device based on a topological superconductor circuit has been introduced where signatures of Majorana fermions could be detected spectroscopically in the transmon regime. This device stores quantum information in coherent superpositions of fermion parity states originating from the Majorana fermions, generating a highly isolated qubit whose coherence time could be greatly enhanced. We extended the conventional semi-classical method and obtained analytical derivations for strong transmon-photon coupling. The analytical challenge is rendered tractable via a formalism based on the WKB method that allows to extract the energy eigenstates of the qubit and its dipole matrix elements. Using this formalism, we study the effect of the Majorana fermions on the quantum electrodynamics of the device embedded within an optical cavity and develop protocols to initialise, control and measure the parity states. We show that, remarkably, the parity eigenvalue can be detected via dispersive shifts of the optical cavity in the strong coupling regime and its state can be coherently manipulated via a second order sideband transition.

abstract: Heavy ions channeling through crystals with multi-GeV kinetic energies can create electron-positron pairs. In the framework of the ion, the energy of virtual photons arising from the periodic crystal potential may exceed the threshold $2mc^2$. The repeated periodic collisions with the crystal ions yield high pair production rates. When the virtual photon frequency matches a nuclear transition in the ion, the production rate can be resonantly increased. In this two-step excitation-pair conversion scheme, the excitation rates are coherently enhanced, and they scale approximately quadratically with the number of crystal sites along the channel.

abstract: Quantum computation requires qubits that can be coupled and realized in a scalable manner, together with universal and high-fidelity one- and two-qubit logic gates \cite{DiVincenzo2000, Loss1998}. Strong effort across several fields have led to an impressive array of qubit realizations, including trapped ions \cite{Brown2011}, superconducting circuits \cite{Barends2014}, single photons\cite{Kok2007}, single defects or atoms in diamond \cite{Waldherr2014, Dolde2014} and silicon \cite{Muhonen2014}, and semiconductor quantum dots \cite{Veldhorst2014}, all with single qubit fidelities exceeding the stringent thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum computing \cite{Fowler2012}. Despite this, high-fidelity two-qubit gates in the solid-state that can be manufactured using standard lithographic techniques have so far been limited to superconducting qubits \cite{Barends2014}, as semiconductor systems have suffered from difficulties in coupling qubits and dephasing \cite{Nowack2011, Brunner2011, Shulman2012}. Here, we show that these issues can be eliminated altogether using single spins in isotopically enriched silicon\cite{Itoh2014} by demonstrating single- and two-qubit operations in a quantum dot system using the exchange interaction, as envisaged in the original Loss-DiVincenzo proposal \cite{Loss1998}. We realize CNOT gates via either controlled rotation (CROT) or controlled phase (CZ) operations combined with single-qubit operations. Direct gate-voltage control provides single-qubit addressability, together with a switchable exchange interaction that is employed in the two-qubit CZ gate. The speed of the two-qubit CZ operations is controlled electrically via the detuning energy and we find that over 100 two-qubit gates can be performed within a two-qubit coherence time of 8 \textmu s, thereby satisfying the criteria required for scalable quantum computation.

Such a sensitivity is a prerequisite for quantum metrology at a precision approaching the Heisenberg limit. Our system is based on fluorescence detection of atoms in a novel hybrid trap in which a dipole barrier divides a magneto-optical trap into two separated wells. We introduce a noise model describing the various sources contributing to the measurement error and report a limit of up to 500 atoms for single-atom resolution in the atom number difference.

abstract: According to general relativity, trapping surfaces and horizons are classical causal structures that arise in systems with sharply defined energy and corresponding gravitational radius. The latter concept can be extended to a quantum mechanical state simply by means of the spectral decomposition, which allows one to define an associated "horizon wave-function". Since this auxiliary wave-function contains crucial information about the causal structure of space-time, a new proposal is formulated for the time-evolution of quantum states in order to account for the fundamental classical property that outer observers cannot receive signals from inside a horizon. The simple case of a single massive free particle at rest is used throughout the paper as a toy model to illustrate the main ideas.

abstract: We systematically investigate the ground state and elementary excitations of a Bose-Einstein Condensate with a synthetic vector potential, which is induced by the many-body effects and atom-light coupling. For a sufficiently strong inter-atom interaction, we find the condensate undergoes a Stoner-type ferromagnetic transition through the self-consistent coupling with the vector potential. For a weak interaction, the critical velocity of a supercurrent is found anisotropic due to the density fluctuations affecting the gauge field. We further analytically demonstrate the topological ground state with a coreless vortex ring in a 3D harmonic trap and a coreless vortex-antivortex pair in a 2D trap. The circulating persistent current is measurable in the time-of-flight experiment or in the dipolar oscillation through the violation of Kohn theorem.

In this paper we further explore the $\tilde{\mu},q$-deformation, namely the version of $\tilde{\mu},q$-Bose gas model involving deformed distributions and correlation functions. In the model, we explicitly derive the one- and two-particle deformed distribution functions and the intercept of two-particle momentum correlation function. The results are illustrated by plots, and the comparison with known experimental data on two-pion correlation function intercepts extracted in RHIC/STAR experiments is given.

Most notably, there are critical bandgaps below which certain low-lying quantum states are missing in a manifestation of atomic collapse.

abstract: In 1995 Doebner and Mann introduced an approach to the ray representations of the Galilei group in ($1+1$)-dimensions, giving rise to quantum generators with an explicit dependence on time. Recently (2004) Wawrzycki proposed a generalization of Bargmann's theory: in his paper he introduce phase exponents that are explicitely dependent by 4-space point. In order to find applications of such generalization, we extend the approach of Doebner and Mann to higher dimensions: as a result, we determine the generators of the ray representation in ($2+1$) and ($3+1$) dimensions. The differences of the outcoming formal apparatus with respect to the smaller dimension case are established.

abstract: In computational complexity, a significant amount of useful theory is built on a foundation of widely-believed conjectures about the separation of complexity classes, the most famous of which is P $\neq$ NP. In this work, we examine the consequences of one such conjecture on the combinatorics of 3-manifold diagrams. We use basic tools from quantum computation to give a simple (and unconditional) proof that the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of 3-manifolds is $\#$P-hard to calculate. We then use this fact to show that, if NP $\neq \#$P, then there exist infinitely many 3-manifold diagrams which cannot be made logarithmically "thin" (relative to their overall size) except perhaps by an exponentially large number of local moves. The latter theorem is an analogue of a result of Freedman for the Jones Polynomial.

abstract: Splitting the energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom by the electric field nonuniform at the atomic scale is studied. This situation is important for the multi-level treatment of the phenomenon of Rydberg blockade [Yu.V. Dumin, J. Phys. B, v.47, p.175502 (2014)]. An explicit formula for the energy levels is derived. A typical value of the energy shift by the electric field gradient turns out to be proportional to the 4th power of the principal quantum number (i.e., the square of atomic size), as would be expected from a qualitative consideration. Finally, the fine spatial structure of the Rydberg blockade is analyzed when the electric-field-gradient term plays the dominant role, and the results are confronted with the experimental data.

abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement of two electron spins in two quantum dots, in which each electron is interacting with its nuclear spin environment. Focusing on the case of uncoupled dots, and starting from either Bell or Werner states of two qubits, we calculate the decay of entanglement due to the hyperfine interaction with the nuclei. We mostly focus on the regime of magnetic fields in which the bath-induced electron spin flips play a role, for example their presence leads to the appearance of entanglement sudden death at finite time for two qubits initialized in a Bell state. For these fields the intrabath dipolar interactions and spatial inhomogeneity of hyperfine couplings are irrelevant on the time scale of coherence (and entanglement) decay, and most of the presented calculations are performed using the uniform-coupling approximation to the exact hyperfine Hamiltonian. We provide a comprehensive overview of entanglement decay in this regime, considering both free evolution of the qubits, and an echo protocol with simultaneous application of $\pi$ pulses to the two spins. All the currently relevant for experiments bath states are considered: the thermal state, narrowed states (characterized by diminished uncertainty of one of the components of the Overhauser field) of two uncorrelated baths, and a correlated narrowed state with a well-defined value of the $z$ component of the Overhauser field interdot gradient. While we mostly use concurrence to quantify the amount of entanglement in a mixed state of the two electron spins, we also show that their entanglement dynamics can be reconstructed from measurements of the currently relevant for experiments entanglement witnesses, and the fidelity of quantum teleportation performed using a partially disentangled state as a resource.

We touch upon an effective CPT symmetry breaking that occurs when deformations and second-neighbor corrections are considered.

abstract: A minimal observable length is a common feature of theories that aim to merge quantum physics and gravity. Quantum mechanically, this concept is associated to a nonzero minimal uncertainty in position measurements, which is encoded in deformed commutation relations. In spite of increasing theoretical interest, the subject suffers from the complete lack of dedicated experiments and bounds to the deformation parameters are roughly extrapolated from indirect measurements. As recently proposed, low-energy mechanical oscillators could allow to reveal the effect of a modified commutator. Here we analyze the free evolution of high quality factor micro- and nano-oscillators, spanning a wide range of masses around the Planck mass $m_{\mathrm{P}}$ (${\approx 22\,\mu\mathrm{g}}$), and compare it with a model of deformed dynamics. Previous limits to the parameters quantifying the commutator deformation are substantially lowered.

abstract: A popular $PT$-symmetric optical potential (variation of the refractive index) that supports a variety of interesting and unusual phenomena is the imaginary exponential, the limiting case of the potential $V_0[\cos(2\pi x/a)+i\lambda\sin(2\pi x/a)]$ as $\lambda \to 1$, the symmetry-breaking point. For $\lambda<1$, when the spectrum is entirely real, there is a well-known mapping by a similarity transformation to an equivalent Hermitian potential. However, as $\lambda \to 1$, the spectrum, while remaining real, contains Jordan blocks in which eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions coincide. In this limit the similarity transformation becomes singular. Nonetheless, we show that the mapping from the original potential to its Hermitian counterpart can still be implemented; however, the inverse mapping breaks down. We also illuminate the role of Jordan associated functions in the original problem, showing that they map onto eigenfunctions in the associated Hermitian problem.

abstract: We compute thermal corrections to R\'enyi entropies of $d$ dimensional conformal field theories on spheres. Consider the $n$th R\'enyi entropy for a cap of opening angle $2 \theta$ on $S^{d-1}$. From a Boltzmann sum decomposition and the operator-state correspondence, the leading correction is related to a certain two-point correlation function of the operator (not equal to the identity) with smallest scaling dimension. More specifically, via a conformal map, the correction can be expressed in terms of the two-point function on a certain conical space with opening angle $2\pi n$. In the case of free conformal field theories, this two-point function can be computed explicitly using the method of images. We perform the computation for the conformally coupled scalar. From the $n \to 1$ limit of our results, we extract the leading thermal correction to the entanglement entropy, reproducing results of arXiv:1407.1358.

abstract: We study a three-body system with zero-range interactions in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. The system consists of two spin-polarized fermions and a third particle which is distinct from two others (2+1 system). First we assume that the particles have equal masses. For this case the system in the strongly and weakly interacting limits can be accurately described using wave function factorized in hyperspherical coordinates. Inspired by this result we propose an interpolation ansatz for the wave function for arbitrary repulsive zero-range interactions. By comparison to numerical calculations, we show that this interpolation scheme yields an extremely good approximation to the numerically exact solution both in terms of the energies and also in the spin-resolved densities. As an outlook, we discuss the case of mass imbalanced systems in the strongly interacting limit. Here we find spectra that demonstrate that the triply degenerate spectrum at infinite coupling strength of the equal mass case is in some sense a singular case as this degeneracy will be broken down to a doubly degenerate or non-degenerate ground state by any small mass imbalance.

abstract: We show that the 2D local Hamiltonian problem with the restriction that the ground state satisfies area laws is QMA-complete. We also prove similar results in 2D translationally invariant systems and for the 3D Heisenberg and Hubbard models. Consequently, in general the ground states of local Hamiltonians satisfying area laws do not have efficient classical representations that support efficient computation of local expectation values unless QMA=NP. Conceptually, even if in the future area laws are proved for the ground state in 2D gapped systems, there is still a long way to go towards understanding the computational complexity of 2D gapped systems.

abstract: We propose a scheme for realizing fractional quantum Hall states of light. In our scheme, photons of two polarizations are coupled to different atomic Rydberg states to form two flavors of Rydberg polaritons that behave as an effective spin. An array of optical cavity modes overlapping with the atomic cloud enables the realization of an effective spin-1/2 lattice. We show that the dipolar interaction between such polaritons, inherited from the Rydberg states, can be exploited to create a flat, topological band for a single spin-flip excitation. At half filling, this gives rise to a photonic (or polaritonic) fractional Chern insulator -- a lattice-based, fractional quantum Hall state of light.

abstract: The scaling symmetry in conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) can be broken due to the boundary conditions that follow from the requirement of a unitary time evolution of the Hamiltonian. We show that the scaling symmetry of CQM can be restored by introducing a suitable mixed state, which is associated with a nonvanishing von Neumann entropy. We give an explicit formula for the entropy arising from the mixed state in CQM. Our work provides a direct link between the restoration of a broken symmetry and von Neumann entropy.

abstract: Quantum spin Hall effect is endowed with topologically protected edge modes with gapless Dirac spectrum. Applying a magnetic field locally along the edge leads to a gapped edge spectrum with opposite parity for winding of spin texture for conduction and valence band. Using Pancharatnam's prescription for geometric phase it is shown that mismatch of this parity across a p-n junction, which could be engineered into the edge by electrical gate induced doping, leads to a phase dependence in the two-terminal conductance which is purely topological (0 or $\pi$). This fact results in a ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ classification of such junctions with an associated duality. Current asymmetry measurements which are shown to be robust against electron-electron interactions are proposed to infer this topology.

abstract: Given graphs $X$ and $Y$, we define two conic feasibility programs which we show have a solution over the completely positive cone if and only if there exists a homomorphism from $X$ to $Y$. By varying the cone, we obtain similar characterizations of quantum/entanglement-assisted homomorphisms and three previously studied relaxations of these relations. Motivated by this, we investigate the properties of these "conic homomorphisms" for general (suitable) cones. We also consider two generalized versions of the Lov\'asz theta function, and how they interact with these conic homomorphisms. We prove analogs of several results on classical graph homomorphisms as well as some monotonicity theorems. We also show that one of the generalized theta functions is multiplicative on lexicographic and disjunctive graph products.

abstract: An explicit multistep scheme is proposed for solving the initial-value Wigner problem. In this scheme, the integrated form of the Wigner equation is approximated by extrapolation or interpolation polynomials on backwards characteristics, and the pseudo-differential operator is tackled by the spectral collocation method. Since it exploits the exact Lagrangian advection, the time stepping of the multistep scheme is not restricted by the CFL-type condition. It is also demonstrated that the calculations of the Wigner potential can be carried out by two successive FFTs, thereby reducing the computational complexity dramatically. Numerical examples illustrating its accuracy are presented.

abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in physics. The quasi-degeneracy between single-particle orbitals $(n, l, j = l + 1/2)$ and $(n-1, l + 2, j = l + 3/2)$ indicates a hidden symmetry in atomic nuclei, the so-called pseudospin symmetry (PSS). Since the introduction of the concept of PSS in atomic nuclei, there have been comprehensive efforts to understand its origin. Both splittings of spin doublets and pseudospin doublets play critical roles in the evolution of magic numbers in exotic nuclei discovered by modern spectroscopic studies with radioactive ion beam facilities. Since the PSS was recognized as a relativistic symmetry in 1990s, many special features, including the spin symmetry (SS) for anti-nucleon, and many new concepts have been introduced. In the present Review, we focus on the recent progress on the PSS and SS in various systems and potentials, including extensions of the PSS study from stable to exotic nuclei, from non-confining to confining potentials, from local to non-local potentials, from central to tensor potentials, from bound to resonant states, from nucleon to anti-nucleon spectra, from nucleon to hyperon spectra, and from spherical to deformed nuclei. Open issues in this field are also discussed in detail, including the perturbative nature, the supersymmetric representation with similarity renormalization group, and the puzzle of intruder states.

abstract: We prove that, regardless of the choice of the angles $\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3$, three fractional Fourier transforms $F_{\theta_1}$, $F_{\theta_2}$ and $F_{\theta_3}$ do not solve the phase retrieval problem. That is, there do not exist three angles $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, $\theta_3$ such that any signal $\psi\in L^2(R)$ could be determined up to a constant phase by knowing only the three intensities $|F_{\theta_1}\psi|^2$, $|F_{\theta_2}\psi|^2$ and $|F_{\theta_3}\psi|^2$. This provides a negative argument against a recent speculation by P. Jaming, who stated that three suitably chosen fractional Fourier transforms are good candidates for phase retrieval in infinite dimension. We recast the question in the language of quantum mechanics, where our result shows that any fixed triple of rotated quadrature observables $Q_{\theta_1}$, $Q_{\theta_2}$ and $Q_{\theta_3}$ is not enough to determine all unknown pure quantum states. The sufficiency of four rotated quadrature observables, or equivalently fractional Fourier transforms, remains an open question.

abstract: Inspired by Montanaro's work, we introduce the concept of additivity rates of a quantum channel $L$, which give the first order (linear) term of the minimum output $p$-R\'enyi entropies of $L^{\otimes r}$ as functions of $r$. We lower bound the additivity rates of arbitrary quantum channels using the operator norms of several interesting matrices including partially transposed Choi matrices. As a direct consequence, we obtain upper bounds for the classical capacity of the channels. We study these matrices for random quantum channels defined by random subspaces of a bipartite tensor product space. A detailed spectral analysis of the relevant random matrix models is performed, and strong convergence towards free probabilistic limits is showed. As a corollary, we compute the threshold for random quantum channels to have the positive partial transpose (PPT) property. We then show that a class of random PPT channels violate generically additivity of the $p$-R\'enyi entropy for all $p\geq30.95$.

abstract: In a system with chiral topological order, there is a remarkable correspondence between the edge and entanglement spectra: the low-energy spectrum of the system in the presence of a physical edge coincides with the lowest part of the entanglement spectrum (ES) across a virtual cut of the system, up to rescaling and shifting. In this paper, we explore whether the edge-ES correspondence extends to nonchiral topological phases. Specifically, we consider the Wen-plaquette model which has Z_2 topological order. The unperturbed model displays an exact correspondence: both the edge and entanglement spectra within each topological sector a (a = 1,...,4) are flat and equally degenerate. Here, we show, through a detailed microscopic calculation, that in the presence of generic local perturbations: (i) the effective degrees of freedom for both the physical edge and the entanglement cut consist of a spin-1/2 chain, with effective Hamiltonians H_edge^a and H_ent.^a, respectively, both of which have a Z_2 symmetry enforced by the bulk topological order; (ii) there is in general no match between their low energy spectra, that is, there is no edge-ES correspondence. However, if supplement the Z_2 topological order with a global symmetry (translational invariance along the edge/cut), i.e. by considering the Wen-plaquette model as a symmetry enriched topological phase (SET), then there is a finite domain in Hamiltonian space in which both H_edge^a and H_ent.^a realize the critical Ising model, whose low-energy effective theory is the c = 1/2 Ising CFT. This is achieved because the presence of the global symmetry implies that both Hamiltonians, in addition to being Z_2 symmetric, are Kramers-Wannier self-dual. Thus, the bulk topological order and the global translational symmetry of the Wen-plaquette model as a SET imply an edge-ES correspondence at least in some finite domain in Hamiltonian space.

abstract: The competition of magnetic exchange interactions and tunneling underlies many complex quantum phenomena observed in real materials. We study non-equilibrium magnetization dynamics in an extended 2D system by loading effective spin-1/2 bosons into a spin-dependent optical lattice, and we use the lattice to separately control the resonance conditions for tunneling and superexchange. After preparing a non-equilibrium anti-ferromagnetically ordered state, we observe relaxation dynamics governed by two well-separated rates, which scale with the underlying Hamiltonian parameters associated with superexchange and tunneling. Remarkably, with tunneling off-resonantly suppressed, we are able to observe superexchange dominated dynamics over two orders of magnitude in magnetic coupling strength, despite the presence of vacancies. In this regime, the measured timescales are in agreement with simple theoretical estimates, but the detailed dynamics of this 2D, strongly correlated, and far-from-equilibrium quantum system remain out of reach of current computational techniques.

abstract: We point out a connection between the emergence of bulk locality in AdS/CFT and the theory of quantum error correction. Bulk notions such as Bogoliubov transformations, location in the radial direction, and the holographic entropy bound all have natural CFT interpretations in the language of quantum error correction. We also show that the question of whether bulk operator reconstruction works only in the causal wedge or all the way to the extremal surface is related to the question of whether or not the quantum error correcting code realized by AdS/CFT is also a "quantum secret sharing scheme", and suggest a tensor network calculation that may settle the issue. Interestingly, the version of quantum error correction which is best suited to our analysis is the somewhat nonstandard "operator algebra quantum error correction" of Beny, Kempf, and Kribs. Our proposal gives a precise formulation of the idea of "subregion-subregion" duality in AdS/CFT, and clarifies the limits of its validity.

These include transparent crossing of high-contrast-index waveguides and directional couplers, as well as crossing of guiding channels in coupled resonator lattices.

abstract: We introduce a lattice model of interacting spins and bosons that leads to Luttinger-liquid physics, and allows for quantitative tests of the theory of bosonization by means of trapped-ion or superconducting-circuit experiments. By using a variational bosonization ansatz, we calculate the power-law decay of spin and boson correlation functions, and study their dependence on a single tunable parameter, namely a bosonic driving. For small drivings, Matrix-Product-States (MPS) numerical methods are shown to be efficient and validate our ansatz. Conversely, even static MPS become inefficient for large-driving regimes, such that the experiment can potentially outperform classical numerics, achieving one of the goals of quantum simulations.

abstract: The connection between the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems and statistical mechanics is a fundamental open question. It is generally believed that the unitary quantum evolution of a sufficiently complex system leads to an apparent maximum-entropy state that can be described by thermodynamical ensembles. However, conventional ensembles fail to describe the large class of systems that exhibit non-trivial conserved quantities. Instead, generalized ensembles have been predicted to maximize entropy in these systems. In our experiments we explicitly show that a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas relaxes to a state that can be described by such a generalized ensemble. This is verified through a detailed study of correlation functions up to 10th order. The applicability of the generalized ensemble description for isolated quantum many-body systems points to a natural emergence of classical statistical properties from the microscopic unitary quantum evolution.

abstract: We consider a recent momentum-resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy experiment, in which Fermi liquid properties of a strongly interacting atomic Fermi gas were studied. Here we show that by extending the Brueckner-Goldstone model, we can formulate a theory that goes beyond basic mean-field theories and that can be used for studying spectroscopies of dilute atomic gases in the strongly interacting regime. The model hosts well-defined quasiparticles and works across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths. The theory provides excellent qualitative agreement with the experiment. Comparing the predictions of the present theory with the mean-field Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory yields insights into the role of pair correlations, Tan's contact, and the Hartree mean-field energy shift.

abstract: Finite width of the analog event horizon is determined by the nonlinearity length in the Kerr nonlinear optical system, which is discussed here, or by the healing length in Bose-Einstein condensates. The various eigen modes of fluctuations are found in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon and the scattering matrix due to the finite width horizon is calculated to within the leading order correction in the nonlinearity length. The Hawking radiation is found to be that of a grey body with the emissivity larger than one. A procedure of paraxial quantization of the fluctuation field is discussed and its connection to the conventional quantization of the electromagnetic field is demonstrated.

abstract: We address two sets of long-standing open questions in probability theory, from a computational complexity perspective: divisibility of stochastic maps, and divisibility and decomposability of probability distributions. We prove that finite divisibility of stochastic maps is an NP-complete problem, and extend this result to nonnegative matrices, and completely-positive trace-preserving maps, i.e. the quantum analogue of stochastic maps. We further prove a complexity hierarchy for the divisibility and decomposability of probability distributions, showing that finite distribution divisibility is in P, but decomposability is NP-hard. For the former, we give an explicit polynomial-time algorithm. All results on distributions extend to weak-membership formulations, proving that the complexity of these problems is robust to perturbations.

abstract: In the present paper we study the evolution of the modes of a scalar field in a cyclic cosmology. In order to keep the discussion clear, we study the features of a scalar field in a toy model, a Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe with a periodic scale factor, in which the universe expands, contracts and bounces infinite times, in the approximation in which the dynamic features of this universe are driven by some external factor, without the backreaction of the scalar field under study. In particular, we show that particle production exhibits features of the cyclic cosmology in the WKB approximation. Also, by studying the Berry phase of the scalar field, we show that contrarily to what is commonly believed, the scalar field carries information from one bounce to another in the form of a global phase which occurs to be generically non-zero.

The symmetry axis of the quadrupole magnetic trap coincides with the optical beam axis, which gives stronger axial confinement than previous hybrid traps. After loading 2x10^6 atoms at 14 muK from a quadrupole magnetic trap into the hybrid trap, we perform efficient forced evaporation and reach the onset of BEC at a temperature of 0.5 muK and with 4x10^5 atoms. We also obtain thermal clouds of 1x10^6 atoms below 1 muK in a pure single beam optical dipole trap, by ramping down the magnetic field gradient after evaporative cooling in the hybrid trap.

abstract: Although polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machines can utilize uncomputable transition probabilities to recognize uncountably many languages with bounded error when allowed to use logarithmic space, it is known that such "magic coins" give no additional computational power to constant-space versions of those machines. We show that adding a few quantum bits to the model changes the picture dramatically. For every language $L$, there exists such a two-way quantum finite automaton that recognizes a language of the same Turing degree as $L$ with bounded error in polynomial time. When used as verifiers in public-coin interactive proof systems, such automata can verify membership in all languages with bounded error, outperforming their classical counterparts, which are known to fail for the palindromes language.

abstract: In this work we calculate the closed time path (CTP) generating functional for the electromagnetic (EM) field interacting with inhomogeneous anisotropic matter. For this purpose, we first find a general expression for the electromagnetic field's influence action from the interaction of the field with a composite environment consisting in the quantum polarization degrees of freedom in each point of space, at arbitrary temperatures, connected to thermal baths. Then, we evaluate the generating functional for the gauge field, in the temporal gauge, by implementing the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Finally, through the point-splitting technique, we calculate closed expressions for the energy, the Poynting vector and the Maxwell tensor in terms of the Hadamard propagator. We show that all the quantities have contributions from the field's initial conditions and also from the matter degrees of freedom. Throughout the whole work we discuss and give insights about how the gauge invariance must be treated in the formalism when the EM field is interacting with inhomogeneous anisotropic matter. We study the electrodynamics in the temporal gauge, obtaining the EM field's equation and a residual condition. Finally analyze the case of the EM field in bulk material and also discuss several general implications of our results in relation with the Casimir physics in a nonequilibrium scenario.

abstract: We theoretically explore atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subject to position-dependent spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This SOC can be produced by cyclically laser coupling four internal atomic ground (or metastable) states in an environment where the detuning from resonance depends on position. The resulting spin-orbit coupled BEC phase-separates into domains, each of which contain density modulations - stripes - aligned either along the x or y direction. In each domain, the stripe orientation is determined by the sign of the local detuning. When these stripes have mismatched spatial periods along domain boundaries, non-trivial topological spin textures form at the interface, including skyrmions-like spin vortices and anti-vortices. In contrast to vortices present in conventional rotating BECs, these spin-vortices are stable topological defects that are not present in the corresponding homogenous stripe-phase spin-orbit coupled BECs.

abstract: The possibility for the Jacobi equation to admit in some cases general solutions that are polynomials has been recently highlighted by Calogero and Yi, who termed them para-Jacobi polynomials. Such polynomials are used here to build seed functions of a Darboux-B\"acklund transformation for the trigonometric Darboux-P\"oschl-Teller potential. As a result, one-step regular rational extensions of the latter depending both on an integer index $n$ and on a continuously varying parameter $\lambda$ are constructed. For each $n$ value, the eigenstates of these extended potentials are associated with a novel family of $\lambda$-dependent polynomials, which are orthogonal on $\left] -1,1\right[ $.

abstract: Detecting the internal state of polar molecules is a substantial challenge when standard techniques such as resonance-enhanced multi photon ionization (REMPI) or laser-induced fluorescense (LIF) do not work. As this is the case for most polyatomic molecule species, we here investigate an alternative based on state selective removal of molecules from an electrically trapped ensemble. Specifically, we deplete molecules by driving rotational and/or vibrational transitions to untrapped states. Fully resolving the rotational state with this method can be a considerable challenge as the frequency differences between various transitions is easily substantially less than the Stark broadening in an electric trap. However, making use of a unique trap design providing homogeneous fields in a large fraction of the trap volume, we successfully discriminate all rotational quantum numbers, including the rotational M-substate.

I discuss the algebra/superalgebra duality involving first and second-order differential operators. It provides different viewpoints for the spectrum-generating subalgebras. The representation-dependent notion of on-shell symmetry is introduced. The difference in associating the time-derivative symmetry operator with either a root or a Cartan generator of the $sl(2)$ subalgebra is discussed. In application to one-dimensional Lagrangian superconformal sigma-models it implies superconformal actions which are either supersymmetric or non-supersymmetric.

abstract: We consider the so-called Hopfield model for the electromagnetic field in a dielectric dispersive medium in a framework in which one allows a space-time dependence of microscopic parameters, aimed to a phenomenological description of a space-time varying dielectric perturbation induced by means of the Kerr effect. We discuss the analogue Hawking effect, by first analyzing the geometrical optics for the Hopfield model, and then by introducing a simplified model which has the bonus to avoid many difficulties which are involved in the full Hopfield model, still keeping the same dispersion relation. Amplitude calculations are indicated, and generalized Manley-Rowe identities are derived in a quantum scattering theory framework. Our main result is an analytical calculation of the spontaneous thermal emission in the single-branch case, which is provided non perturbatively for the first time in the framework of dielectric black holes. An universal mechanism for thermality between optical black holes and acoustic black holes is also pointed out.

abstract: We set up a tunneling approach to the analogue Hawking effect in the case of models of analogue gravity which are affected by dispersive effects. An effective Schroedinger-like equation for the basic scattering phenomenon IN->P+N*, where IN is the incident mode, P is the positive norm reflected mode, and N* is the negative norm one, signalling particle creation, is derived, aimed to an approximate description of the phenomenon. Horizons and barrier penetration play manifestly a key-role in giving rise to pair-creation. The non-dispersive limit is also correctly recovered. Drawbacks of the model are also pointed out and a possible solution ad hoc is suggested.

abstract: We consider an extension of classical stochastic reaction-diffusion (RD) dynamics to open quantum systems. We study a class of models of hard core particles on a one-dimensional lattice whose dynamics is generated by a quantum master operator and where particle hopping is coherent while reactions, such as pair annihilation or pair coalescence, are dissipative. These are quantum open generalisations of the $A+A \to \varnothing$ and $A+A \to A$ classical RD models. We characterise the relaxation of the state towards the stationary regime via a decomposition of the system Hilbert space into transient and recurrent subspaces. We provide a complete classification of the structure of the recurrent subspace (and the non-equilibrium steady states) in terms of the dark states associated to the quantum master operator and its general spectral properties. We also show that, in one dimension, relaxation towards these absorbing dark states is slower than that predicted by a mean-field analysis due to fluctuation effects, in analogy with what occurs in classical RD systems. Numerical simulations of small systems suggest that the decay of the density in one dimension, in both the open quantum $A+A \to \varnothing$ and $A+A \to A$ cases, may go asymptotically as $t^{-b}$ with $1/2 < b < 1$.

abstract: Ar{\i}kan's polar coding technique is based on the idea of synthesizing $n$ channels from the $n$ instances of the physical channel by a simple linear encoding transformation. Each synthesized channel corresponds to a particular input to the encoder. For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either essentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much information as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by transmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels. Unfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels is poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying physical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient to determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete memoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the other. Understanding the alignment of the polarized sets is important as it is directly related to universality properties of the induced polar codes, which are essential in particular for network coding problems. We demonstrate the performance of our conditions on a few examples for wiretap and broadcast channels. Finally we show that these conditions imply that the simple quantum polar coding scheme of Renes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050504 (2012)] requires entanglement assistance for general channels, but also show such assistance to be unnecessary in many cases of interest.

abstract: Adiabatic quantum optimization has been proposed as a route to solve NP-complete problems, with a possible quantum speedup compared to classical algorithms. However, the precise role of quantum effects, such as entanglement, in these optimization protocols is still unclear. We propose a setup of cold trapped ions that allows one to quantitatively characterize, in a controlled experiment, the interplay of entanglement, decoherence, and non-adiabaticity in adiabatic quantum optimization. We show that, in this way, a broad class of NP-complete problems becomes accessible for quantum simulations, including the knapsack problem, number partitioning, and instances of the max-cut problem. Moreover, a general theoretical study reveals correlations of the success probability with entanglement at the end of the protocol. From exact numerical simulations for small systems and linear ramps, however, we find no substantial correlations with the entanglement during the optimization. For the final state, we derive analytically a universal upper bound for the success probability as a function of entanglement, which can be measured in experiment. The proposed trapped-ion setups and the presented study of entanglement address pertinent questions of adiabatic quantum optimization, which may be of general interest across experimental platforms.

abstract: The directed percolation universality class possibly represents the simplest instance of a genuine non-equilibrium phase transition from an absorbing state to a fluctuating active phase. It is often thought to be as fundamental as the Ising universality class is for equilibrium. However, despite being known for several decades, it has been challenging to find experimental systems that manifest this transition. Here we show theoretically that signatures of the directed percolation universality class emerge in ensembles of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. We demonstrate that even mesoscopic ensembles --- which are currently studied experimentally --- are sufficient to observe traces of this non-equilibrium phase transition in one, two and three dimensions.
