abstract: We consider quantum kinetics of an open quantum system in the presence of periodic fields designed to suppress the internal evolution and shield the system from generic low-frequency environment (refocusing or dynamical decoupling in application to multi-qubit systems). Assuming that the refocusing has order K, that is, for frozen environment the cumulant expansion of the evolution operator over the period tau begins with the term ~tau^(K+1), we trace the associated cancellations in the kernel of the quantum kinetic equation in the Floquet formalism and characterize the remaining decoherence processes.

abstract: The blackbody radiation is analyzed in universes with $D$ spatial dimensions. With the classical electrodynamics suited to the universe in focus and recurring to the hyperspherical coordinates, it is shown that the spectral energy density as well as the total energy density are sensible to the dimensionality of the universe. Wien's displacement law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are properly generalized.

It is shown that an infinite set of bound-state solutions can be found on the condition that the fermion is embedded in an additional uniform background potential. An apparent paradox concerning the uncertainty principle is solved by introducing the concept of effective Compton wavelength.

abstract: We present numerical evidence showing that any three-dimensional subspace of C^3 \otimes C^n has an orthonormal basis which can be reliably distinguished using one-way LOCC, where a measurement is made first on the 3-dimensional part and the result used to select an optimal measurement on the n-dimensional part. This conjecture has implications for the LOCC-assisted capacity of certain quantum channels, where coordinated measurements are made on the system and environment. By measuring first in the environment, the conjecture would imply that the environment-assisted classical capacity of any rank three channel is at least log 3. Similarly by measuring first on the system side, the conjecture would imply that the environment-assisting classical capacity of any qutrit channel is log 3. We also show that one-way LOCC is not symmetric, by providing an example of a qutrit channel whose environment-assisted classical capacity is less than log 3.

abstract: It is shown that a highly phase sensitive polarization squeezed (2n-1)-photon state can be generated by subtracting a diagonally polarized photon from the 2n photon component generated in collinear type II downconversion. This polarization wedge state has the interesting property that its photon number distribution in the horizontal and vertical polarizations remains sharply defined for phase shifts of up to 1/n between the circularly polarized components. Phase shifts at the Heisenberg limit are therefore observed as nearly deterministic transfers of a single photon between the horizontal and vertical polarization components.

abstract: We present Bell inequalities for graph states with high violation of local realism. In particular, we show that there is a two-setting Bell inequality for every nontrivial graph state which is violated by the state at least by a factor of two. These inequalities are facets of the convex polytope containing the many-body correlations consistent with local hidden variable models. We first present a method which assigns a Bell inequality for each graph vertex. Then for some families of graph states composite Bell inequalities can be constructed with a violation of local realism increasing exponentially with the number of qubits. We also suggest a systematic way for obtaining Bell inequalities with a high violation of local realism for arbitrary graphs.

We show that a sequence of pulses of moderate intensity, applied at times when the average of the observable reaches its local or global extremum, constitutes a strategy transferable to different control issues. Among them, post-pulse molecular alignment and orientation are presented as examples. The robustness of such strategies with respect to experimentally relevant parameters is also examined.

abstract: The Fuchs-Peres-Brandt (FPB) probe realizes the most powerful individual attack on Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution by means of a single controlled-NOT gate in which Alice's transmitted qubit becomes the control-qubit input, Bob's received qubit is the control-qubit output, and Eve supplies the target-qubit input and measures the target-qubit output. The FPB probe uses the minimum-error-probability projective measurement for discriminating between the target-qubit output states that are perfectly correlated with Bob's sifted bit value when that bit is correctly received. This paper analyzes a recently proposed modification of the FPB attack in which Eve's projective measurement is replaced by a probability operator-valued measurement chosen to unambiguously discriminate between the same two target-qubit output states.

abstract: Interpreting quantum mechanics(QM) by classical physics seems like an old topic; And unified theory is in physics frontier; But because the principles of quantum physics and relativity are so different, any theories of trying to unify 4 nature forces should not be considered as completed without truly unifying the basic principles between QM and relativity. This paper will interpret quantum physics by using two extra dimensional time as quantum hidden variables. I'll show that three dimensional time is a bridge to connect basics quantum physics, relativity and string theory. ``Quantum potential'' in Bohm's quantum hidden variable theory is derived from Einstein Lagrangian in 6-dimensional time-space geometry. Statistical effect in the measurement of single particle, non-local properties, de Broglie wave can be naturally derived from the natural properties of three dimensional time. Berry phase, double-slit interference of single particle, uncertainty relation, wave-packet collapse are discussed. The spin and g factor are derived from geometry of extra two time dimensions. Electron can be expressed as time monopole. In the last part of this paper, I'll discuss the relation between three dimensional time and unified theory. Key words: Quantum hidden variable, Interpreting of quantum physics, Berry phase, three dimensional time, unified theory

abstract: This work shows how a secure Internet can be implemented through a fast key distribution system that uses physical noise to protect the transmitted information. Starting from a shared random sequence $K_0$ between two (or more) users, longsequences $R$ of random bits can be shared. The signals sent over the Internet are deterministic but have a built-in Nature-made uncertainty that protects the shared sequences. After privacy amplification the shared $R$ random bits --encrypted by noise-- are subsequently utilized in one-time-pad data ciphering.

abstract: Finding control fields (pulse sequences) that can compensate for the dispersion in the parameters governing the evolution of a quantum system is an important problem in coherent spectroscopy and quantum information processing. The use of composite pulses for compensating dispersion in system dynamics is widely known and applied. In this paper, we make explicit the key aspects of the dynamics that makes such a compensation possible. We highlight the role of Lie algebras and non-commutativity in the design of a compensating pulse sequence. Finally we investigate three common dispersions in NMR spectroscopy, the Larmor dispersion, rf-inhomogeneity and strength of couplings between the spins.

The effect of inefficient detector is also considered.

abstract: We analyze the achievable precision for single-qubit gates that are based on Raman transitions between two near-degenerate ground states via a virtually excited state. In particular, we study the errors due to non-perfect adiabaticity and due to spontaneous emission from the excited state. For the case of non-adabaticity, we calculate the error as a function of the dimensionless parameter $\chi=\Delta \tau$, where $\Delta$ is the detuning of the Raman beams and $\tau$ is the gate time. For the case of spontaneous emission, we give an analytical argument that the gate errors are approximately equal to $\Lambda \gamma/\Delta$, where $\Lambda$ is the rotation angle of the one-qubit gate and $\gamma$ is the spontaneous decay rate, and we show numerically that this estimate holds to good approximation.

abstract: We study how to unambiguously identify a given quantum pure state with one of the two reference pure states when no classical knowledge on the reference states is given but a certain number of copies of each reference quantum state are presented. By the unambiguous identification, we mean that we are not allowed to make a mistake but our measurement can produce an inconclusive result. Assuming the two reference states are independently distributed over the whole pure state space in a unitary invariant way, we determine the optimal mean success probability for an arbitrary number of copies of the reference states and a general dimension of the state space. It is explicitly shown that the obtained optimal mean success probability asymptotically approaches that of the unambiguous discrimination as the number of the copies of the reference states increases.

abstract: The stability of two entangled spins dressed by electrons is studied by calculating the scattering phase shifts. The interaction between electrons is interpreted by fully relativistic QED and the screening effect is described phenomenologically in the Debye exponential form $e^{-\alpha r}$. Our results show that if the (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-) EPR-type states are kept stable under the interaction of QED, the spatial wave function must be parity-dependent. The spin-singlet state $s=0$ and the polarized state $\frac 1{\sqrt{2}}(\mid +-> -\mid -+>)$ along the z-axis\QTR{bf}{\}give rise to two different kinds of phase shifts\QTR{bf}{.} Interestingly, the interaction between electrons in the spin-singlet pair is found to be attractive. Such an attraction could be very useful when we extract the entangled spins from superconductors. A mechanism to filter the entangled spins is also discussed.

abstract: We analyze how entanglement between two components of a bipartite system behaves under the action of local channels of the form $\cE\otimes\cI$. We show that a set of maximally entangled states is by the action of $\cE\otimes\cI$ transformed into the set of states that exhibit the same degree of entanglement. Moreover, this degree represents an upper bound on entanglement that is available at the output of the channel irrespective what is the input state of the composite system. We show that within this bound the the entanglement-induced state ordering is ``relative'' and can be changed by the action of local channels. That is, two states $\varrho_1^{(in)}$ and $\varrho_2^{(in)}$ such that the entanglement $E[\varrho_1^{(in)}]$ of the first state is larger than the entanglement $E[\varrho_2^{(in)}]$ of the second state are transformed into states $\varrho_1^{(out)}$ and $\varrho_2^{(out)}$ such that $E[\varrho_2^{(out)}] > E[\varrho_1^{(out)}]$.

A new interesting feature in presence of deformation is that the WKB approximation is valid for intermediate quantum numbers and can be invalid for small as well as very large quantum numbers. The correctness of the rule is verified by comparing obtained results with exact expressions for corresponding spectra.

This applies to various types of generalized partial separabilities. We also give a rigorous proof that the new Bell inequalities are maximally violated by the GHZ states, and find a very handy description of the N-qubit correlation function.

abstract: We investigate accessibility and controllability of a quantum system S coupled to a quantum probe P, both described by two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, under the hypothesis that the external control affects only P. In this context accessibility and controllability properties describe to what extent it is possible to drive the state of the system S by acting on P and using the interaction between the two systems. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for these properties and we discuss the relation with the entangling capability of the interaction between S and P. In particular, we show that controllability can be expressed in terms of the SWAP operator, acting on the composite system, and its square root.

abstract: We present a scheme for correcting qubit loss error while quantum computing with neutral atoms in an addressable optical lattice. The qubit loss is first detected using a quantum non-demolition measurement and then transformed into a standard qubit error by inserting a new atom in the vacated lattice site. The logical qubit, encoded here into four physical qubits with the Grassl-Beth-Pellizzari code, is reconstructed via a sequence of one projective measurement, two single-qubit gates, and three controlled-NOT operations. No ancillary qubits are required. Both quantum non-demolition and projective measurements are implemented using a cavity QED system which can also detect a general leakage error and thus allow qubit loss to be corrected within the same framework. The scheme can also be applied in quantum computation with trapped ions or with photons.

abstract: We consider entanglement detection for quantum key distribution systems that use two signal states and continuous variable measurements. This problem can be formulated as a separability problem in a qubit-mode system. To verify entanglement, we introduce an object that combines the covariance matrix of the mode with the density matrix of the qubit. We derive necessary separability criteria for this scenario. These criteria can be readily evaluated using semidefinite programming and we apply them to the specific quantum key distribution protocol.

We construct a path integral representation for the propagator of such systems and derive its semiclassical limit. As special cases we consider separable systems, the limit of very large spins and the case of spin 1/2.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510024
abstract: A new and intuitive perturbative approach to time-dependent quantum mechanics problems is presented, which is useful in situations where the evolution of the Hamiltonian is slow. The state of a system which starts in an instantaneous eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian is written as a power series which has a straightforward diagrammatic representation. Each term of the series corresponds to a sequence of "adiabatic" evolutions, during which the system remains in an instantaneous eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, punctuated by transitions from one state to another. The first term of this series is the standard adiabatic evolution, the next is the well-known first correction to it, and subsequent terms can be written down essentially by inspection. Although the final result is perhaps not terribly surprising, it seems to be not widely known, and the interpretation is new, as far as we know. Application of the method to the adiabatic approximation is given, and some discussion of the validity of this approximation is presented.

abstract: We compare the performance of BB84 and SARG04, the later of which was proposed by V. Scarani et al., in Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 057901 (2004). Specifically, in this paper, we investigate SARG04 with two-way classical communications and SARG04 with decoy states. In the first part of the paper, we show that SARG04 with two-way communications can tolerate a higher bit error rate (19.4% for a one-photon source and 6.56% for a two-photon source) than SARG04 with one-way communications (10.95% for a one-photon source and 2.71% for a two-photon source). Also, the upper bounds on the bit error rate for SARG04 with two-way communications are computed in a closed form by considering an individual attack based on a general measurement. In the second part of the paper, we propose employing the idea of decoy states in SARG04 to obtain unconditional security even when realistic devices are used. We compare the performance of SARG04 with decoy states and BB84 with decoy states. We find that the optimal mean-photon number for SARG04 is higher than that of BB84 when the bit error rate is small. Also, we observe that SARG04 does not achieve a longer secure distance and a higher key generation rate than BB84, assuming a typical experimental parameter set.

abstract: We examine the problem of simulating lattice gauge theories on a universal quantum computer. The basic strategy of our approach is to transcribe lattice gauge theories in the Hamiltonian formulation into a Hamiltonian involving only Pauli spin operators such that the simulation can be performed on a quantum computer using only one and two qubit manipulations. We examine three models, the U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) lattice gauge theories which are transcribed into a spin Hamiltonian up to a cutoff in the Hilbert space of the gauge fields on the lattice. The number of qubits required for storing a particular state is found to have a linear dependence with the total number of lattice sites. The number of qubit operations required for performing the time evolution corresponding to the Hamiltonian is found to be between a linear to quadratic function of the number of lattice sites, depending on the arrangement of qubits in the quantum computer. We remark that our results may also be easily generalized to higher SU(N) gauge theories.

abstract: A brief presentation of the basic concepts in quantum probability theory is given in comparison to the classical one. The notion of quantum white noise, its explicit representation in Fock space, and necessary results of noncommutative stochastic analysis and integration are outlined. Algebraic differential equations that unify the quantum non Markovian diffusion with continuous non demolition observation are derived. A stochastic equation of quantum diffusion filtering generalising the classical Markov filtering equation to the quantum flows over arbitrary *-algebra is obtained. A Gaussian quantum diffusion with one dimensional continuous observation is considered.The a posteriori quantum state difusion in this case is reduced to a linear quantum stochastic filter equation of Kalman-Bucy type and to the operator Riccati equation for quantum correlations. An example of continuous nondemolition observation of the coordinate of a free quantum particle is considered, describing a continuous collase to the stationary solution of the linear quantum filtering problem found in the paper.

We also give a dense coding scheme ${\cal D}_0$ involving our state as a shared resource of entanglement. Both ${\cal D}_0$ and ${\cal E}_0$ indicate that our four-qubit state is a likely candidate for the genunine four-partite analogue to a Bell state.

abstract: A stationary theory of quantum stochastic processes of second order is outlined. It includes KMS processes in wide sense like the equilibrium finite temperature quantum noise given by the Planck's spectral formula. It is shown that for each stationary noise there exists a natural output process output process which is identical to the noise in the infinite temperature limit, and flipping with the noise if the time is reversed at finite temperature. A canonical Hilbert space representation of the quantum noise and the fundamental output process is established and a decomposition of their spectra is found. A brief explanation of quantum stochastic integration with respect to the input-output processes is given using only correlation functions. This provides a mathematical foundation for linear stationary filtering transformations of quantum stochastic processes. It is proved that the colored quantum stationary noise and its time-reversed version can be obtained in the second order theory by a linear nonadapted filtering of the standard vacuum noise uniquely defined by the canonical creation and annihilation operators on the spectrum of the input-output pair.

The resulting state can then be rewritten in terms of its matrix product state representation in such a way that quantum entanglement corresponds to classical correlations between different coarse-grained textures. A truncation of the MPS representation is tantamount to a compression of the original image. The resulting algorithm can be improved adding a discrete Fourier transform preprocessing and a further entropic lossless compression.

abstract: These lecture notes survey some joint work with Samson Abramsky as it was presented by me at several conferences in the summer of 2005. It concerns `doing quantum mechanics using only pictures of lines, squares, triangles and diamonds'. This picture calculus can be seen as a very substantial extension of Dirac's notation, and has a purely algebraic counterpart in terms of so-called Strongly Compact Closed Categories (introduced by Abramsky and I in quant-ph/0402130 and [4]) which subsumes my Logic of Entanglement quant-ph/0402014. For a survey on the `what', the `why' and the `hows' I refer to a previous set of lecture notes quant-ph/0506132. In a last section we provide some pointers to the body of technical literature on the subject.

abstract: We review some partial results for two strictly related problems. The first problem consists in finding the optimal joint unitary transformation on system and ancilla which is the most efficient in programming any desired channel on the system by changing the state of the ancilla. In this respect we present a solution for dimension two for both system and ancilla. The second problem consists in finding the optimal universal programmable detector, namely a device that can be tuned to perform any desired measurement on a given quantum system, by changing the state of an ancilla. With a finite dimension for the ancilla only approximate universal programmability is possible, with minimal dimension increasing function versus the precision of the approximation. We show that one can achieve a dimension growing polynomially versus the precision, and even linearly in specific cases.

abstract: An important open problem in quantum information theory is the question of the existence of NPT bound entanglement. In the past years, little progress has been made, mainly because of the lack of mathematical tools to address the problem. (i) In an attempt to overcome this, we show how the distillability problem can be reformulated as a special instance of the separability problem, for which a large number of tools and techniques are available. (ii) Building up to this we also show how the problem can be formulated as a Schmidt number problem. (iii) A numerical method for detecting distillability is presented and strong evidence is given that all 1-copy undistillable Werner states are also 4-copy undistillable. (iv) The same method is used to estimate the volume of distillable states, and the results suggest that bound entanglement is primarily a phenomenon found in low dimensional quantum systems. (v) Finally, a set of one parameter states is presented which we conjecture to exhibit all forms of distillability.

abstract: We study the differences between the process of decoherence induced by chaotic and regular environments. For this we analyze a family of simple models wich contain both regular and chaotic environments. In all cases the system of interest is a "quantum walker", i.e. a quantum particle that can move on a lattice with a finite number of sites. The walker interacts with an environment wich has a D dimensional Hilbert space. The results we obtain suggest that regular and chaotic environments are not distinguishable from each other in a (short) timescale t*, wich scales with the dimensionality of the environment as t*~log(D). Howeber, chaotic environments continue to be effective over exponentially longer timescales while regular environments tend to reach saturation much sooner. We present both numerical and analytical results supporting this conclusion. The family of chaotic evolutions we consider includes the so-called quantum multi-baker-map as a particular case.

abstract: We discuss time displaced entanglement, produced by taking one member of a Bell pair on a round trip at relativistic speeds, thus inducing a time-shift between the pair. We show that decoherence with respect to Bell measurements on the pair is predicted. We then study a teleportation protocol, using time displaced entanglement as its resource, in which a time-like loop is apparently formed. The result is non-unitary, non-linear evolution of the teleported state.

abstract: If YES, then we can look forward to physical realization of superluminal communication, as the original considerations of the ``no-cloning'' theorem were motivated in part as an explanation of why certain schemes for superluminal signaling cannot work. If NO, then it would seem that some aspects of the ``hidden'' variables must be ``intrinsically hidden'', i.e., ``unknowable'', such that ``hidden-variable'' theories belong more to the ``idealist'' than to the ``realist'' school of thought. I pose this question without proposing a definite answer. I am unaware of any commentary on this topic during these 23 years since the formulation of the ``no-cloning'' theorem, but I would be pleased to be enlightened by more knowledgeable readers.

abstract: The general conditions are discussed which quantum state purification protocols have to fulfill in order to be capable of purifying Bell-diagonal qubit-pair states, provided they consist of steps that map Bell-diagonal states to Bell-diagonal states and they finally apply a suitably chosen Calderbank-Shor-Steane code to the outcome of such steps. As a main result a necessary and a sufficient condition on asymptotic correctability are presented, which relate this problem to the magnitude of a characteristic exponent governing the relation between bit and phase errors under the purification steps. These conditions allow a straightforward determination of maximum tolerable bit error rates of quantum key distribution protocols whose security analysis can be reduced to the purification of Bell-diagonal states.

It is found that the entanglement is generated during the pre-processing stage of the algorithm and remains nearly constant during the quantum Fourier transform stage. The entanglement is found to be correlated with the speedup achieved by the quantum algorithm compared to classical algorithms.

abstract: We extend our previous work (see arXiv:quant-ph/0501026), which compared the predictions of quantum electrodynamics concerning radiation reaction with those of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac theory for a charged particle in linear motion. Specifically, we calculate the predictions for the change in position of a charged scalar particle, moving in three-dimensional space, due to the effect of radiation reaction in the one-photon-emission process in quantum electrodynamics. The scalar particle is assumed to be accelerated for a finite period of time by a three-dimensional electromagnetic potential dependent only on one of the spacetime coordinates. We perform this calculation in the $\hbar\to 0$ limit and show that the change in position agrees with that obtained in classical electrodynamics with the Lorentz-Dirac force treated as a perturbation. We also show for a time-dependent but space-independent electromagnetic potential that the forward-scattering amplitude at order $e^2$ does not contribute to the position change in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit after the mass renormalization is taken into account.

abstract: We establish essentially optimal bounds on the complexity of initial-value problems in the randomized and quantum settings. For this purpose we define a sequence of new algorithms whose error/cost properties improve from step to step. These algorithms yield new upper complexity bounds, which differ from known lower bounds by only an arbitrarily small positive parameter in the exponent, and a logarithmic factor. In both the randomized and quantum settings, initial-value problems turn out to be essentially as difficult as scalar integration.

abstract: We introduce quantum walks with a time-dependent coin, and show how they include, as a particular case, the generalized quantum walk recently studied by Wojcik et al. {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{93}, 180601(2004){]} which exhibits interesting dynamical localization and quasiperiodic dynamics. Our proposal allows for a much easier implementation of this particular rich dynamics than the original one. Moreover, it allows for an additional control on the walk, which can be used to compensate for phases appearing due to external interactions. To illustrate its feasibility, we discuss an example using an optical cavity. We also derive an approximated solution in the continuous limit (long--wavelength approximation) which provides physical insight about the process.

abstract: Present quantum Monte Carlo codes use statistical techniques adapted to find the amplitude of a quantum system or the associated eigenvalues. Thus, they do not use a true physical random source. It is demonstrated that, in fact, quantum probability admits a description based on a specific class of random process at least for the single particle case. Then a first principle Monte Carlo code that exactly simulates quantum dynamics can be constructed. The subtle question concerning how to map random choices in amplitude interferences is explained. Possible advantages of this code in simulating single hit experiments are discussed.

abstract: Within the context of quantum teleportation, a proposed intuitive model to explain bipartite entanglement describes the scheme as being the same qubit of information evolving along and against the flow of time of an external observer. We investigate the physicality of such a model by applying the time-reversal of the Schrodinger equation in the teleportation context. To do so, we first lay down the theory of time-reversal applied to the circuit model and then show that the outcome of a teleportation-like circuit is consistent with the usual tensor product treatment, thus independent of the physical quantum system used to encode the information. Finally, we demonstrate a proof of principle experiment on a liquid state NMR quantum information processor. The experimental results are consistent with the interpretation that information can be seen as flowing backward in time through entanglement.

abstract: The level crossing problem is neatly formulated by the second quantized formulation, which exhibits a hidden local gauge symmetry. The analysis of geometric phases is reduced to a simple diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. If one diagonalizes the geometric terms in the infinitesimal neighborhood of level crossing, the geometric phases become trivial (and thus no monopole singularity) for arbitrarily large but finite time interval $T$. The topological proof of the Longuet-Higgins' phase-change rule, for example, thus fails in the practical Born-Oppenheimer approximation where $T$ is identified with the period of the slower system. The crucial difference between the Aharonov-Bohm phase and the geometric phase is explained. It is also noted that the gauge symmetries involved in the adiabatic and non-adiabatic geometric phases are quite different.

abstract: Generalizing a boolean function from Cleve and Buhrman \cite{cb:sqec}, we consider the class of {\it accumulative boolean functions} of the form $f_B(X_1,X_2,..., X_m)=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n t_B(x_i^1x_i^2... x_i^m)$, where $X_j=(x^j_1,x^j_2,..., x^j_n), 1\leq j\leq m$ and $t_B(x_i^1x_i^2... x_i^m)=1$ for input $m$-tuples $x_i^1x_i^2...x_i^m\in B\subseteq A\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, and 0, if $x_i^1x_i^2...x_i^m\in A\setminus B$. Here the set $A$ is the input {\it promise} set for function $f_B$. The input vectors $X_j, 1\leq j\leq m$ are given to the $m\geq 3$ parties respectively, who communicate cbits in a distributed environment so that one of them (say Alice) comes up with the value of the function. We algebraically characterize entanglement assisted LOCC protocols requiring only $m-1$ cbits of communication for such multipartite boolean functions $f_B$, for certain sets $B\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, for $m\geq 3$ parties under appropriate uniform parity promise restrictions on input $m$-tuples $x_i^1x_i^2...x_i^m, 1\leq i\leq n$. We also show that these functions can be computed using $2m-3$ cbits in a purely classical deterministic setup. In contrast, for certain $m$-party accumulative boolean functions ($m\geq 2$), we characterize promise sets of mixed parity for input $m$-tuples so that $m-1$ cbits of communication suffice in computing the functions in the absence of any a priori quantum entanglement. We compactly represent all these protocols and the corresponding input promise restrictions using uniform group theoretic and hamming distance characterizations.

abstract: We propose an entanglement generation scheme that requires neither the coherent evolution of a quantum system nor the detection of single photons. Instead, the desired state is heralded by a {\em macroscopic} quantum jump. Macroscopic quantum jumps manifest themselves as a random telegraph signal with long intervals of intense fluorescence (light periods) interrupted by the complete absence of photons (dark periods). Here we show that a system of two atoms trapped inside an optical cavity can be designed such that a dark period prepares the atoms in a maximally entangled ground state. Achieving fidelities above 0.9 is possible even when the single-atom cooperativity parameter C is as low as 10 and when using a photon detector with an efficiency as low as eta = 0.2.

abstract: In this chapter we review the characterization of entanglement in Gaussian states of continuous variable systems. For two-mode Gaussian states, we discuss how their bipartite entanglement can be accurately quantified in terms of the global and local amounts of mixedness, and efficiently estimated by direct measurements of the associated purities. For multimode Gaussian states endowed with local symmetry with respect to a given bipartition, we show how the multimode block entanglement can be completely and reversibly localized onto a single pair of modes by local, unitary operations. We then analyze the distribution of entanglement among multiple parties in multimode Gaussian states. We introduce the continuous-variable tangle to quantify entanglement sharing in Gaussian states and we prove that it satisfies the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality. Nevertheless, we show that pure, symmetric three-mode Gaussian states, at variance with their discrete-variable counterparts, allow a promiscuous sharing of quantum correlations, exhibiting both maximum tripartite residual entanglement and maximum couplewise entanglement between any pair of modes. Finally, we investigate the connection between multipartite entanglement and the optimal fidelity in a continuous-variable quantum teleportation network. We show how the fidelity can be maximized in terms of the best preparation of the shared entangled resources and, viceversa, that this optimal fidelity provides a clearcut operational interpretation of several measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement, including the entanglement of formation, the localizable entanglement, and the continuous-variable tangle.

abstract: Recently, D. Gottesman et al. [Phys. Rev. A 64, 012310 (2001)] showed how to encode a qubit into a continuous variable quantum system. This encoding was realized by using non-normalizable quantum codewords, which therefore can only be approximated in any real physical setup. Here we show how a neutral atom, falling through an optical cavity and interacting with a single mode of the intracavity electromagnetic field, can be used to safely encode a qubit into its external degrees of freedom. In fact, the localization induced by a homodyne detection of the cavity field is able to project the near-field atomic motional state into an approximate quantum codeword. The performance of this encoding process is then analyzed by evaluating the intrinsic errors induced in the recovery process by the approximated form of the generated codeword.

abstract: The Casimir and van der Waals interaction between two dissimilar thick dielectric plates is reconsidered on the basis of thermal quantum field theory in Matsubara formulation. We briefly review two main derivations of the Lifshitz formula in the framework of thermal quantum field theory without use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A set of special conditions is formulated under which these derivations remain valid in the presence of dissipation. The low-temperature behavior of the Casimir and van der Waals interactions between dissimilar dielectrics is found analytically from the Lifshitz theory for both an idealized model of dilute dielectrics and for real dielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivities. The free energy, pressure and entropy of the Casimir and van der Waals interactions at low temperatures demonstrate the same universal dependence on the temperature as was previously discovered for ideal metals. The entropy vanishes when temperature goes to zero proving the validity of the Nernst heat theorem. This solves the long-standing problem on the consistency of the Lifshitz theory with thermodynamics in the case of dielectric plates. The obtained asymptotic expressions are compared with numerical computations for both dissimilar and similar real dielectrics and found to be in excellent agreement. The role of the zero-frequency term in Matsubara sum is investigated in the case of dielectric plates. It is shown that the inclusion of conductivity in the model of dielectric response leads to the violation of the Nernst heat theorem. The applications of this result to the topical problems of noncontact atomic friction and the Casimir interaction between real metals are discussed.

abstract: A critical requirement for diverse applications in Quantum Information Science is the capability to disseminate quantum resources over complex quantum networks. For example, the coherent distribution of entangled quantum states together with quantum memory to store these states can enable scalable architectures for quantum computation, communication, and metrology. As a significant step toward such possibilities, here we report observations of entanglement between two atomic ensembles located in distinct apparatuses on different tables. Quantum interference in the detection of a photon emitted by one of the samples projects the otherwise independent ensembles into an entangled state with one joint excitation stored remotely in 10^5 atoms at each site. After a programmable delay, we confirm entanglement by mapping the state of the atoms to optical fields and by measuring mutual coherences and photon statistics for these fields. We thereby determine a quantitative lower bound for the entanglement of the joint state of the ensembles. Our observations provide a new capability for the distribution and storage of entangled quantum states, including for scalable quantum communication networks .

abstract: We analyze the performance of holonomic quantum gates in semi-conductor quantum dots, driven by ultrafast lasers, under the effect of a dissipative environment. In agreement with the standard practice, the environment is modeled as a thermal bath of oscillators linearly coupled with the excitonic states of the quantum dot. Standard techniques of quantum dissipation make the problem amenable to a numerical treatment and allow to determine the fidelity (the common gate-performance estimator), as a function of all the relevant physical parameters. As a consequence of our analysis, we show that, by varying in a suitable way the controllable parameters, the disturbance of the environment can be (approximately) suppressed, and the performance of the gate optimized--provided that the thermal bath is purely superhomic. We conclude by showing that such an optimization it is impossible for ohmic environments.

abstract: The eigenvalue problem for the dressed bound-state of unstable multilevel systems is examined both outside and inside the continuum, based on the N-level Friedrichs model which describes the couplings between the discrete levels and the continuous spectrum. It is shown that a bound-state eigenenergy always exists below each of the discrete levels that lie outside the continuum. Furthermore, by strengthening the couplings gradually, the eigenenergy corresponding to each of the discrete levels inside the continuum finally emerges. On the other hand, the absence of the eigenenergy inside the continuum is proved in weak but finite coupling regimes, provided that each of the form factors that determine the transition between some definite level and the continuum does not vanish at that energy level. An application to the spontaneous emission process for the hydrogen atom interacting with the electromagnetic field is demonstrated.

abstract: The motion of a particle is studied in a random space-time. It is assumed that the velocity is small enough for the non-relativistic approximation to be valid. The randomness of the metric induces a diffusion in coordinate space. Hence it is shown that the evolution of the probability density is given by Schroedinger equation.

abstract: Many useful concepts for a quantum theory of scattering and decay (like Lippmann-Schwinger kets, purely outgoing boundary conditions, exponentially decaying Gamow vectors, causality) are not well defined in the mathematical frame set by the conventional (Hilbert space) axioms of quantum mechanics. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger equations as the takeoff point and aiming for a theory that unites resonances and decay, we conjecture a new axiom for quantum mechanics that distinguishes mathematically between prepared states and detected observables. Suggested by the two signs $\pm i\epsilon$ of the Lippmann-Schwinger equations, this axiom replaces the one Hilbert space of conventional quantum mechanics by two Hardy spaces. The new Hardy space theory automatically provides Gamow kets with exponential time evolution derived from the complex poles of the $S$-matrix. It solves the causality problem since it results in a semigroup evolution. But this semigroup brings into quantum physics a new concept of the semigroup time $t=0$, a beginning of time. Its interpretation and observations are discussed in the last section.

abstract: Generation of a single photon or a pair of photons from a single emitter is important for quantum information applications. Using the generating function formalism we investigate the theory of a few photons on demand for the square laser pulse and the rapid adiabatic following method. Exact theory and numerical solutions are used to design control fields for a two level emitter, which yield an optimal single or two photon source, under the constrains of finite laser field strength and finite interaction time. Comparison to experiments of Brunel et al, shows that the experiments were made close to optimal conditions.

abstract: The length of a secure link over which a quantum key can be distributed depends on the efficiency and dark-count rate of the detectors used at the receiver. We report on the first demonstration of quantum key distribution using transition-edge sensors with high efficiency and negligible dark-count rates. Using two methods of synchronization, a bright optical pulse scheme and an electrical signal scheme, we have successfully distributed key material at 1,550 nm over 50 km of optical fiber. We discuss how use of these detectors in a quantum key distribution system can result in dramatic increases in range and performance.

abstract: We investigate entanglement properties of a recently introduced class of macroscopic quantum superpositions in two-mode mixed states. One of the tools we use in order to infer the entanglement in this non-Gaussian class of states is the power to entangle a qubit system. Our study reveals features which are hidden in a standard approach to entanglement investigation based on the uncertainty principle of the quadrature variables. We briefly describe the experimental setup corresponding to our theoretical scenario and a suitable modification of the protocol which makes our proposal realizable within the current experimental capabilities.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Some recent theoretical studies have tended to employ analytically-continuous {\em gaussian}, or infinite-bandwidth step pulses to examine tunneling process. The stationary phase method is often employed to this aim. However, {\em gaussian} functions do not have a well-defined front, such that their speed of propagation becomes ambiguous. Also, infinite bandwidth signals cannot propagate through any real physical medium (whose transfer function is therefore finite) without pulse distortion, which also leads to ambiguities in determining propagation velocity during the tunneling process. In this manuscript, we appoint some incompatibilities with the application of the method of stationary phase in deriving tunneling times which, eventually, can ruin the {\em superluminal} interpretation of transition times.

This exceeds the performance of any possible classical search algorithm, which can only succeed with a maximum average probability of 50%.

We present a protocol which enables the parties to extract from such untrusted states an arbitrarily long and secure key, even though the amount of distillable entanglement of the untrusted states can be arbitrarily small.

abstract: By viewing entanglement as a state function, a new kind of phase transition takes place: the geometric phase transition. This phenomenon occurs due to singularities in the shape of the entangled states set. It is shown how this result can be carried to provide a better understanding of the geometry of entanglement. Surprisingly, this study can be done experimentally, what allows to determine the shape of different entangled states sets, a purely mathematical definition, in real experiments.

abstract: Ground state instabilities of the spin-boson model is studied in this work. The existence of sequential ground state instabilities is shown analytically for arbitrary detuning in the two-spin system. In this model, extra discontinuities of concurrence(entanglement measure) are found in the finite system, which do not appear in the on-resonant model. The above results remain intact by including extra boson modes. Moreover, by including extra modes, it is found that ground state entanglement can be obtained and enhanced even in the weak coupling regime.

The three subsystems ($A$, $B$ and $C$) are designed such that $C$ interacts simultaneously with both $A$ and $B$, while there is not any interaction between $A$ and $B$. On this basis, we emphasize validity of the condition of locality in a realistic physical situation.

abstract: This paper is devoted to systematic study of properties of the quantum entropy and of the Holevo capacity considered as a function of a set of quantum states. The properties of restriction of the quantum entropy to arbitrary set of states are discussed. For some types of sets necessary and sufficient conditions of boundedness and of continuity of restriction of the quantum entropy as well as necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of the Gibbs state are obtained. The Holevo capacity of an arbitrary set of states and its general properties as a function of a set are considered. The notion of the optimal average state of an arbitrary set of states with finite Holevo capacity is introduced. The condition of existence of optimal measure for a set of states is obtained. The general results concerning the quantum entropy and the Holevo capacity are illustrated by considering the several examples of sets of states.

We demonstrate continuous variable RSP in three examples using (i) quadrature measurement and phase space displacement operations, (ii) measurement of the optical phase and unitaries shifting the same, and (iii) photon counting and photon number shift.

abstract: For two discrete-level quantum systems in interaction, we follow the displacement in the complex plane of the eigen-energies of the compound system when the spectrum of one of the two systems becomes continuous. These new points are usually called resonances. This allows us to define and to calculate a critical value of the coupling constant which separates two well-known coupling regimes. We also give an example of these resonances for the hydrogen atom coupled to the continuum of the states of the transverse electromagnetic field in the vacuum. We justify that some resonances be neglected.

abstract: Quantum theory imposes a strict limit on the strength of non-local correlations. It only allows for a violation of the CHSH inequality up to the value 2 sqrt(2), known as Tsirelson's bound. In this note, we consider generalized CHSH inequalities based on many measurement settings with two possible measurement outcomes each. We demonstrate how to prove Tsirelson bounds for any such generalized CHSH inequality using semidefinite programming. As an example, we show that for any shared entangled state and observables X_1,...,X_n and Y_1,...,Y_n with eigenvalues +/- 1 we have |<X_1 Y_1> + <X_2 Y_1> + <X_2 Y_2> + <X_3 Y_2> + ... + <X_n Y_n> - <X_1 Y_n>| <= 2 n cos(pi/(2n)). It is well known that there exist observables such that equality can be achieved. However, we show that these are indeed optimal. Our approach can easily be generalized to other inequalities for such observables.

abstract: This paper is concerned with all tests for continuous-variable entanglement that arise from linear combinations of second moments or variances of canonical coordinates, as they are commonly used in experiments to detect entanglement. All such tests for bi-partite and multi-partite entanglement correspond to hyperplanes in the set of second moments. It is shown that all optimal tests, those that are most robust against imperfections with respect to some figure of merit for a given state, can be constructed from solutions to semi-definite optimization problems. Moreover, we show that for each such test, referred to as entanglement witness based on second moments, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the witness and a stronger product criterion, which amounts to a non-linear witness, based on the same measurements. This generalizes the known product criteria. The presented tests are all applicable also to non-Gaussian states. To provide a service to the community, we present the documentation of two numerical routines, FULLYWIT and MULTIWIT, which have been made publicly available.

abstract: We show that the usefulness of a state as an activator in teleportation protocols is equivalent to the robustness of its entanglement to noise. The robustness of entanglement of a bi-partite state is linked to the maximum increase in the the fidelity of teleportation of any other state when the former is used as an extra resource. On the one hand, this connection gives an operational meaning to the robustness of entanglement. On the other hand, it shows that the activation capability - which has a central role as an operational way of quantifying bound entangled states - can be estimated experimentally by measuring entanglement witnesses.

abstract: We solve the boson normal ordering problem for $(q(a^\dag)a+v(a^\dag))^n$ with arbitrary functions $q(x)$ and $v(x)$ and integer $n$, where $a$ and $a^\dag$ are boson annihilation and creation operators, satisfying $[a,a^\dag]=1$. This consequently provides the solution for the exponential $e^{\lambda(q(a^\dag)a+v(a^\dag))}$ generalizing the shift operator. In the course of these considerations we define and explore the monomiality principle and find its representations. We exploit the properties of Sheffer-type polynomials which constitute the inherent structure of this problem. In the end we give some examples illustrating the utility of the method and point out the relation to combinatorial structures.

Such expansions, obtained as formal power series, are everywhere divergent but the Pade summation method is shown to give results which very well agree with exact solutions got for simplified quantum models of the one mode bosonic systems.

abstract: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle has been understood to set a limitation on measurements; however, the long-standing mathematical formulation established by Heisenberg, Kennard, and Robertson does not allow such an interpretation. Recently, a new relation was found to give a universally valid relation between noise and disturbance in general quantum measurements, and it has become clear that the new relation plays a role of the first principle to derive various quantum limits on measurement and information processing in a unified treatment. This paper examines the above development on the noise-disturbance uncertainty principle in the model-independent approach based on the measurement operator formalism, which is widely accepted to describe a class of generalized measurements in the field of quantum information. We obtain explicit formulas for the noise and disturbance of measurements given by the measurement operators, and show that projective measurements do not satisfy the Heisenberg-type noise-disturbance relation that is typical in the gamma-ray microscope thought experiments. We also show that the disturbance on a Pauli operator of a projective measurement of another Pauli operator constantly equals the square root of 2, and examine how this measurement violates the Heisenberg-type relation but satisfies the new noise-disturbance relation.

abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that Lindblad equations characterized by a random rate variable arise after tracing out a complex structured reservoir. Our results follows from a generalization of the Born-Markov approximation, which relies in the possibility of splitting the complex environment in a direct sum of sub-reservoirs, each one being able to induce by itself a Markovian system evolution. Strong non-Markovian effects, which microscopically originate from the entanglement with the different sub-reservoirs, characterize the average system decay dynamics. As an example, we study the anomalous irreversible behavior of a quantum tunneling system described in an effective two level approximation. Stretched exponential and power law decay behaviors arise from the interplay between the dissipative and unitary hopping dynamics.

abstract: We study a model of a two-level system (i.e. a qubit) in interaction with the electromagnetic field. By means of homodyne detection, one field-quadrature is observed continuously in time. Due to the interaction, information about the initial state of the qubit is transferred into the field, thus influencing the homodyne measurement results. We construct random variables (pointers) on the probability space of homodyne measurement outcomes having distributions close to the initial distributions of sigma-x and sigma-z. Using variational calculus, we find the pointers that are optimal. These optimal pointers are very close to hitting the bound imposed by Heisenberg's uncertainty relation on joint measurement of two non-commuting observables. We close the paper by giving the probability densities of the pointers.

abstract: The Relational Blockworld (RBW) interpretation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics (NRQM) is introduced. Accordingly, the spacetime of NRQM is a relational, non-separable blockworld whereby spatial distance is only defined between interacting trans-temporal objects. RBW is shown to provide a novel statistical interpretation of the wavefunction that deflates the measurement problem, as well as a geometric account of quantum entanglement and non-separability that satisfies locality per special relativity and is free of interpretative mystery. We present RBW's acausal and adynamical resolution of the so-called "quantum liar paradox," an experimental set-up alleged to be problematic for a spacetime conception of reality, and conclude by speculating on RBW's implications for quantum gravity.

abstract: Any Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol consists first of sequences of measurements that produce some correlation between classical data. We show that these correlation data must violate some Bell inequality in order to contain distillable secrecy, if not they could be produced by quantum measurements performed on a separable state of larger dimension. We introduce a new QKD protocol and prove its security against any individual attack by an adversary only limited by the no-signaling condition.

abstract: We develop and defend the thesis that the Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics is a new theory of probability. The theory, like its classical counterpart, consists of an algebra of events, and the probability measures defined on it. The construction proceeds in the following steps: (a) Axioms for the algebra of events are introduced following Birkhoff and von Neumann. All axioms, except the one that expresses the uncertainty principle, are shared with the classical event space. The only models for the set of axioms are lattices of subspaces of inner product spaces over a field K. (b) Another axiom due to Soler forces K to be the field of real, or complex numbers, or the quaternions. We suggest a probabilistic reading of Soler's axiom. (c) Gleason's theorem fully characterizes the probability measures on the algebra of events, so that Born's rule is derived. (d) Gleason's theorem is equivalent to the existence of a certain finite set of rays, with a particular orthogonality graph (Wondergraph). Consequently, all aspects of quantum probability can be derived from rational probability assignments to finite "quantum gambles". We apply the approach to the analysis of entanglement, Bell inequalities, and the quantum theory of macroscopic objects. We also discuss the relation of the present approach to quantum logic, realism and truth, and the measurement problem.

Using the information-theoretical notion of a strongly typical set, we calculate the asymptotic yield of the protocol as the solution of a linear programming problem.

The device has been physically realized by means of a linear optical qubit manipulation, post-selection measurement and a classical feed-forward process.

abstract: Quantization and asymptotic behaviour of a variant of discrete random walk on integers are investigated. This variant, the $\epsilon_{V^{k}}$ walk, has the novel feature that it uses many identical quantum coins keeping at the same time characteristic quantum features like the quadratically faster than the classical spreading rate, and unexpected distribution cutoffs. A weak limit of the position probability distribution (pd) is obtained, and universal properties of this arch sine asymptotic distribution function are examined. Questions of driving the walk are investigated by means of a quantum optical interaction model that reveals robustness of quantum features of walker's asymptotic pd, against stimulated and spontaneous quantum noise on the coin system.

abstract: A scheme for retrieving quantum information stored in collective atomic spin systems onto optical pulses is presented. Two off-resonant light pulses cross the atomic medium in two orthogonal directions and are interferometrically recombined in such a way that one of the outputs carries most of the information stored in the medium. In contrast to previous schemes our approach requires neither multiple passes through the medium nor feedback on the light after passing the sample which makes the scheme very efficient. The price for that is some added noise which is however small enough for the method to beat the classical limits.

abstract: We examine the spatial distribution of electrons generated by a fixed energy point source in uniform, parallel electric and magnetic fields. This problem is simple enough to permit analytic quantum and semiclassical solution, and it harbors a rich set of features which find their interpretation in the unusual and interesting properties of the classical motion of the electrons: For instance, the number of interfering trajectories can be adjusted in this system, and the turning surfaces of classical motion contain a complex array of singularities. We perform a comprehensive analysis of both the semiclassical approximation and the quantum solution, and we make predictions that should serve as a guide for future photodetachment experiments.

abstract: An Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-like argument using events separated by a time-like interval strongly suggestes that measuring the polarization state of a photon of an entangled pair changes the polarization state of the other distant photon. Trough a very simple demonstration, the Wigner-D'Espagnat inequality is used to show that in order to prove Bell's theorem neither the assumption that there is a well-defined space of complete states $\lambda $ of the particle pair and well-defined probability distribution $\rho (\lambda)$ over this space nor the use of counterfactuals is necessary. These results reinforce the viewpoint that quantum mechanics implicitly presupposes some sort of nonlocal connection between the particles of an entangled pair. As will become evident from our discussion, relinquishing realism and/or free will cannot solve this apparent puzzle.

A thin layer quantization procedure is implemented to bring the electron onto $\Sigma$, leading to the well known geometric potential $V_C \propto h^2-k$ and a second potential that couples $A_N$, the component of $\mathbf A$ normal to $\Sigma$ to mean surface curvature, as well as a term dependent on the normal derivative of $A_N$ evaluated on $\Sigma$. Numerical results in the form of ground state energies as a function of the applied field in several orientations are presented for a toroidal model.

abstract: We study creation of bi- and multipartite continuous variable entanglement in structures of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. By adjusting the interaction strengths between nearest neighbors we show how to maximize the entanglement production between the arms in a Y-shaped structure where an initial single mode squeezed state is created in the first oscillator of the input arm. We also consider the action of the same structure as an approximate quantum cloner. For a specific time in the system dynamics the last oscillators in the output arms can be considered as imperfect copies of the initial state. By increasing the number of arms in the structure, multipartite entanglement is obtained, as well as 1 to M cloning. Finally, we are considering configurations that implement the symmetric splitting of an initial entangled state. All calculations are carried out within the framework of the rotating wave approximation in quantum optics, and our predictions could be tested with current available experimental techniques.

abstract: Study of the normalizer of the MAD-group corresponding to a finegrading offers the most important tool for describing symmetries in the system of non-linear equations connected with contraction of a Lie algebra. One fine grading that is always present in any Lie algebra $sl(n,\mathbb{C})$ is the Pauli grading. The MAD-group corresponding to it is generated by generalized Pauli matrices. For such MAD-group, we already know its normalizer; its quotient group is isomorphic to the Lie group $Sl(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)\times v\mathbb{Z}_2$. In this paper, we deal with a more complicated situation, namely that the fine grading of $sl(p^2, \mathbb{C})$ is given by a tensor product of the Pauli matrices of the same order $p$, $p$ being a prime. We describe the normalizer of the corresponding MAD-group and we show that its quotient group is isomorphic to $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z}_p)\times\mathbb{Z}_2$.

This encoding provides a natural error correction scheme that can correct errors due to small shifts of the position or momentum wave functions (i.e., use of the displacement operator). We present bounds on the size of correctable shift errors when both qubit and ancilla states may contain errors. We then use these bounds to constrain the quality of input qubit and ancilla states.

abstract: A quantum version of the Minority game for an arbitrary number of agents is considered. It is known that when the number of agents is odd, quantizing the game produces no advantage to the players, but for an even number of agents new Nash equilibria appear that have no classical analogue and have improved payoffs. We study the effect on the Nash equilibrium payoff of various forms of decoherence. As the number of players increases the multipartite GHZ state becomes increasingly fragile, as indicated by the smaller error probability required to reduce the Nash equilibrium payoff to the classical level.

abstract: We study the quantum state transfer (QST) in a class of qubit network with on-site interaction, which is described by the generalized Hubbard model with engineered couplings. It is proved that the system of two electrons with opposite spins in this quantum network of $N$ sites can be rigorously reduced into $N$ one dimensional engineered single Bloch electron models with central potential barrier. With this observation we find that such system can perform a perfect QST, the quantum swapping between two distant electrons with opposite spins. Numerical results show such QST and the resonant-tunnelling for the optimal on-site interaction strengths.

abstract: We investigate a novel quantum random walk (QRW) model, possibly useful in quantum algorithm implementation, that achieves a quadratically faster diffusion rate compared to its classical counterpart. We evaluate its asymptotic behavior expressed in the form of a limit probability distribution of a double horn shape. Questions of robustness and control of that limit distribution are addressed by introducing a quantum optical cavity in which a resonant Jaynes-Cummings type of interaction between the quantum walk coin system realized in the form of a two-level atom and a laser field is taking place. Driving the optical cavity by means of the coin-field interaction time and the initial quantum coin state, we determine two types of modification of the asymptotic behavior of the QRW. In the first one the limit distribution is robustly reproduced up to a scaling, while in the second one the quantum features of the walk, exemplified by enhanced diffusion rate, are washed out and Gaussian asymptotics prevail. Verification of these findings in an experimental setup that involves two quantum optical cavities that implement the driven QRW and its quantum to classical transition is discussed.

A train of pulses is considered as a possible strategy to reach this target. An illustration is given by considering the laser control of molecular alignment / orientation in thermal equilibrium.

abstract: We consider a mass-less manifestly covariant {\it linear} Schr\"odinger equation. First, we show that it possesses a class of non-dispersive soliton solution with finite-size spatio-temporal support inside which the quantum amplitude satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation with finite {\it emergent} mass. We then proceed to interpret the soliton wave function as describing a particle with finite mass, energy and momentum. Inside the spatio-temporal support, the wave function shows spatio-temporal internal vibration with angular frequency and wave number that are determined by the energy-momentum of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Imposing resonance of the internal vibration inside the spatio-temporal support leads to Planck-Einstein quantization of energy-momentum. The first resonance mode is shown to recover the classical energy-momentum relation developed in special relativity. We further show that the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation allows one to construct many solitons solution through superposition, each describing a particle with various masses, energies and momenta.

Roknizadeh and Prof. S. Twareque Ali as my supervisor and advisor, respectively. I will revisit some of the pioneering proposals recently developed the concept of generalized CSs. As it can be observed the customary three generalization methods {\it (symmetry, algebraic and dynamical)} have never been considered in neither of them. Our intention in this work is at first to investigate the lost ring between the customary three methods and the recently developed ones, as possible. For this purpose it has been devised general analytic descriptions, which successfully demonstrate how different varieties of CSs (which are nonlinear in nature) can be obtained by two processes, first the {\it "nonlinear CSs"} method and second by {\it "basis transformations on an underlying Hilbert spaces"}. As a result, I will systematize the recently introduced generalized CSs in a clear and concise way. It will be clear also, that how our results can be considered as a first step in the generation process of the mathematical physics CSs in the context of quantum optics. Besides this, some new results emerge from our studies. I introduce a large classes of generalized CSs, namely the {\it "dual family"} associated with each set of early known CSs. But, in this relation, the previous processes for constructing the dual pair of Gazeau-Klauder CSs fail to work well, so I outlined a rather different method based on the {\it "temporal stability"} requirement of generalized nonlinear CSs.

authors: J. Orlin Grabbe
comments: 9 pages

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510122
abstract: There has been a recent tendency to apply Schroedinger's wave equation to macroscopic domains, from Bose-Einstein condensates in neutron stars to planetary orbits. In these applications a hydrodynamical interpretation, involving vortices in some 'fluid' medium is often given. The vortex picture appears surprising in light of more traditional interpretations of Schroedinger's equation, and indeed often appears to rely on ad hoc analogies. The purpose of this letter is to examine the vortex hypothesis in light of a simple, transparent mathematical framework. We find that Schroedinger's equation implies waves can be vortices also for a class of wave functions. Vortices occur in pairs that perform a sort of quantum computation by collapsing into either 0 or 1. Vortices collapsing to 0 ('0-vortices') are longer-lived, and their ratio to 1-vortices is discussed.

abstract: The refinement and specifications of time-energy uncertainty relations have shown that the experimentally observed phenomena of superluminal signaling are describable by such their form: $\Delta E\Delta\tau\geq\pi\hbar$, where both standard deviations are negative. When $\Delta\tau<0$, these evanescent photons would be instantly tunneling from one light cone into another on the distance $c| \Delta\tau| $. (This assertion, previously proved via dispersion relations, is described here by the temporal parameters of process.) Special forms of these relations describe the transmutation of particles into their partners of bigger mass, in $K^{0}$ and $B^{0}$ cases and at the $\nu$'s transmutations. Thus, the violations of relativistic causality by evanescent particles can be considered as the tunneling, as an analog of the short-term violation of conservation laws at virtual transitions. The absence of Lorentz invariance at such transitions can, probably, allow violations of some other symmetries.

abstract: The Lie algebra of the group SU(2) is constructed from two deformed oscillator algebras for which the deformation parameter is a root of unity. This leads to an unusual quantization scheme, the {J2,Ur} scheme, an alternative to the familiar {J2,Jz} quantization scheme corresponding to common eigenvectors of the Casimir operator J2 and the Cartan operator Jz. A connection is established between the eigenvectors of the complete set of commuting operators {J2,Ur} and mutually unbiased bases in spaces of constant angular momentum.

abstract: The problem analysis results made the author to draw a conclusion that the nature of the resonance frequency long-term instability and drift at harmonic excitation is related to the phase dynamics of the "atom + field" system in the small vicinity of the resonance. The investigation is based on the strictly substantiated asymptotic Krylov-Bogolyubov perturbation theory. A time-dependent (drift) first-order correction of the perturbing field amplitude to the resonance frequency was disclosed. It was found that this correction is always present and is responsible for the frequency drift and long-term instability. The necessary and sufficient conditions of accurate resonance, as well as the conditions of realization of a stable (stationary, steady-state) drift-free oscillation regime in a quantum system, are obtained.

abstract: Algebraic random walks (ARW) and quantum mechanical random walks (QRW) are investigated and related. Based on minimal data provided by the underlying bialgebras of functions defined on e. g the real line R, the abelian finite group Z_N, and the canonical Heisenberg-Weyl algebra hw, and by introducing appropriate functionals on those algebras, examples of ARWs are constructed. These walks involve short and long range transition probabilities as in the case of R walk, bistochastic matrices as for the case of Z_N walk, or coherent state vectors as in the case of hw walk. The increase of classical entropy due to majorization order of those ARWs is shown, and further their corresponding evolution equations are obtained. Especially for the case of hw ARW, the diffusion limit of evolution equation leads to a quantum master equation for the density matrix of a boson system interacting with a bath of quantum oscillators prepared in squeezed vacuum state. A number of generalizations to other types of ARWs and some open problems are also stated. Next, QRWs are briefly presented together with some of their distinctive properties, such as their enhanced diffusion rates, and their behavior in respect to the relation of majorization to quantum entropy. Finally, the relation of ARWs to QRWs is investigated in terms of the theorem of unitary extension of completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) evolution maps by means of auxiliary vector spaces. It is applied to extend the CPTP step evolution map of a ARW for a quantum walker system into a unitary step evolution map for an associated QRW of a walker+quantum coin system. Examples and extensions are provided.

abstract: We investigate the effects of nonlinear couplings and external magnetic field on the thermal entanglement in a two-spin-qutrit system by applying the concept of negativity. It is found that the nonlinear couplings favor the thermal entanglement creating. Only when the nonlinear couplings $|K|$ are larger than a certain critical value does the entanglement exist. The dependence of the thermal entanglement in this system on the magnetic field and temperature is also presented. The critical magnetic field increases with the increasing nonlinear couplings constant $|K|$. And for a fixed nonlinear couplings constant, the critical temperature is independent of the magnetic field $B$.

abstract: Marzlin and Sanders \cite{marzlin} have shown rigorously that the adiabatic approximation can be very inaccurate when applied to a Hamiltonian $H(t)$ that generates the evolution $U^{\dagger} (t)$ even if it gives an excellent approximation to the evolution $U(t)$ generated by a dual Hamiltonian $h(t)$. We show that this is not inconsistent with the adiabatic theorem and find that in general even if $h(t)$ satisfies the conditions of the adiabatic theorem, $H(t)$ will likely violate those conditions.

abstract: By the topological argument that the identity matrix is surrounded by a set of separable states follows the result that if a system is entangled at thermal equilibrium for some temperature, then it presents a phase transition (PT) where entanglement can be viewed as the order parameter. However, analyzing different entanglement measures in the 2-qubit context, we see that different entanglement quantifiers can indicate different orders for the same PT. Examples are given for different Hamiltonians. Moving to the multipartite context we show necessary and sufficient conditions for a family of entanglement monotones to attest quantum phase transitions.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510133
abstract: We show that the global infinitesimal change in the multi-particle pure product state gives rise to an entangled state. This suggests that even if there is no interaction present between the subsystems, i.e., at each time instant the state is non-entangled, the tangent vector is typically entangled. Since the tangent space vectors tell the state-space vectors how to change this implies that quantum entanglement is necessary for motion or change in general. This is truly a `hidden power' of quantum entanglement. During quantum computation even though at each time instant the state is not entangled, quantum entanglement guides the process of computation. This observation applies to multi-particle pure, pseudo-pure and mixed states as well.

abstract: Several authors have used the Heisenberg picture to show that the atomic transitions, the stability of the ground state and the position-momentum commutation relation [x,p]=ih, can only be explained by introducing radiation reaction and vacuum electromagnetic fluctuation forces. Here we consider the simple case of a nonrelativistic charged harmonic oscillator, in one dimension, to investigate how to take into account the radiation reaction and vacuum fluctuation forces within the Schrodinger picture. We consider the effects of both classical zero-point and thermal electromagnetic vacuum fields. We show that the zero-point electromagnetic fluctuations are dynamically related to the momentum operator p=-ih d/dx used in the Schrodinger picture. Consequently, the introduction of the zero-point electromagnetic fields in the vector potential A_x(t) used in the Schrodinger equation, generates ``double counting'', as was shown recently by A.J. Faria et al. (Physics Letters A 305 (2002) 322). We explain, in details, how to avoid the ``double counting'' by introducing only the radiation reaction and the thermal electromagnetic fields into the Schrodinger equation.

abstract: Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before the walk reaches an ending condition. To be analogous to the hitting time for a classical walk, the quantum hitting time must involve repeated measurements as well as unitary evolution. We derive an expression for hitting time using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the discrete walk on the hypercube. The values found are compared to other analogues of hitting time suggested in earlier work. The dependence of hitting times on the type of unitary ``coin'' is examined, and we give an example of an initial state and coin which gives an infinite hitting time for a quantum walk. Such infinite hitting times require destructive interference, and are not observed classically. Finally, we look at distortions of the hypercube, and observe that a loss of symmetry in the hypercube increases the hitting time. Symmetry seems to play an important role in both dramatic speed-ups and slow-downs of quantum walks.

For massive particles, we show that the density matrix can be decomposed with separable states.

abstract: An integral of the Wigner function of a wavefunction |psi >, over some region S in classical phase space is identified as a (quasi) probability measure (QPM) of S, and it can be expressed by the |psi > average of an operator referred to as the region operator (RO). Transformation theory is developed which provides the RO for various phase space regions such as point, line, segment, disk and rectangle, and where all those ROs are shown to be interconnected by completely positive trace increasing maps. The latter are realized by means of unitary operators in Fock space extended by 2D vector spaces, physically identified with finite dimensional systems. Bounds on QPMs for regions obtained by tiling with discs and rectangles are obtained by means of majorization theory.

By introducing a subensemble-atomic system to deal with present inhomogeneous coupling case, we find there is a non-symmetric dark-state subspace (DSS) that allows the EIT quantum memory technique to function perfectly. This shows that such memory scheme can work ideally even if the atomic state is very far from being a symmetric one.

abstract: We propose a scheme for broadcasting entanglement at a distance based on linear optics. We show that an initial polarization entangled state can be simultaneously split and transmitted to a pair of observers situated at different locations with the help of two conditional Bell-state analyzers based on two beam splitters characterized by the same reflectivity R. In particular for R=1/3 the final states coincide with the output states obtained by the broadcasting protocol proposed by Buzek et al. [Phys. Rev. A 55, 3327 (1997)]. Further we present a different protocol called telecloning of entanglement, which combines the many-to-many teleportation and nonlocal optimal asymmetric cloning of an arbitrary entangled state. This scheme allows the optimal transmission of the two nonlocal optimal clones of an entangled state to two pairs of spatially separated receivers.

comments: 54 pages; proposes a general quantum algorithm that can be applied to any classical computer program
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510146
abstract: This paper proposes a general quantum algorithm that can be applied to any classical computer program. Each computational step is written using reversible operators, but the operators remain classical in that the qubits take on values of only zero and one. This classical restriction on the quantum states allows the copying of qubits, a necessary requirement for doing general classical computation. Parallel processing of the quantum algorithm proceeds because of the superpositioning of qubits, the only aspect of the algorithm that is strictly quantum mechanical. Measurement of the system collapses the superposition, leaving only one state that can be observed. In most instances, the loss of information as a result of measurement would be unacceptable. But the linguistically motivated theory of Analogical Modeling (AM) proposes that the probabilistic nature of language behavior can be accurately modeled in terms of the simultaneous analysis of all possible contexts (referred to as supracontexts) providing one selects a single supracontext from those supracontexts that are homogeneous in behavior (namely, supracontexts that allow no increase in uncertainty). The amplitude for each homogeneous supracontext is proportional to its frequency of occurrence, with the result that the probability of selecting one particular supracontext to predict the behavior of the system is proportional to the square of its frequency.

We explore the dynamic mechanisms to creating the quantum entanglements among photon states, and between photons and atomic collective excitations by the coherent manipulation of the atom-photon system. It is shown that the quantum information can be completely transferred from one quantized optical mode to another, and the quantum information carried by the two quantized optical fields can be stored in the collective modes of this atomic ensemble by adiabatically controlling the classic field Rabi frequencies.

abstract: The notion of Loschmidt echo (also called "quantum fidelity") has been introduced in order to study the (in)-stability of the quantum dynamics under perturbations of the Hamiltonian. It has been extensively studied in the past few years in the physics literature, in connection with the problems of "quantum chaos", quantum computation and decoherence. In this paper, we study this quantity semiclassically (as $\hbar \to 0$), taking as reference quantum states the usual coherent states. The latter are known to be well adapted to a semiclassical analysis, in particular with respect to semiclassical estimates of their time evolution. For times not larger than the so-called "Ehrenfest time" $C | \log \hbar |$, we are able to estimate semiclassically the Loschmidt Echo as a function of $t$ (time), $\hbar$ (Planck constant), and $\delta$ (the size of the perturbation). The way two classical trajectories merging from the same point in classical phase-space, fly apart or come close together along the evolutions governed by the perturbed and unperturbed Hamiltonians play a major role in this estimate. We also give estimates of the "return probability" (again on reference states being the coherent states) by the same method, as a function of $t$ and $\hbar$.

abstract: Quantum computing is an attractive and multidisciplinary field, which became a focus for experimental and theoretical research during last decade. Among other systems, like ions in traps or superconducting circuits, solid-states based qubits are considered to be promising candidates for first experimental tests of quantum hardware. Here we report recent progress in quantum information processing with point defect in diamond. Qubits are defined as single spin states (electron or nuclear). This allows exploring long coherence time (up to seconds for nuclear spins at cryogenic temperatures). In addition, the optical transition between ground and excited electronic states allows coupling of spin degrees of freedom to the state of the electromagnetic field. Such coupling gives access to the spin state readout via spin-selective scattering of photon. This also allows using of spin state as robust memory for flying qubits (photons).

We show that in the thermodynamic limit the irreducible part of the $n$th-order nonlinear susceptibility indicates that the eigenstates of the system contain entangled $(n+1)$-qubit clusters. This opens the way to a directly observable multiqubit entanglement signature. We show that the irreducible part of the static cubic susceptibility of a system of four flux qubits, as a function of external parameters, behaves as a global 4-qubit entanglement measure introduced in Ref.\cite{Love}. We discuss the possibility of extracting purely-entanglement-generated contribution from the general multipoint correlators in a multiqubit system.

For pure states ideal broadcasting coincides with the so-called "quantum cloning", describing an hypothetical ideal device capable of producing from a finite number N of copies of a state (drawn from a set) a larger number M>N of output copies of the same state. Since such a transformation is not isometric, it cannot be achieved by any physical machine for a quantum state drawn from a non orthogonal set: this is essentially the content of the "no-cloning" theorem. For mixed states the situation is quite different, since from the point of view of each single user a local marginal mixed state is indistinguishable from the partial trace of an entangled state, and there are infinitely many joint output states that correspond to ideal broadcasting. Indeed, for sufficiently large number $N$ of input copies, not only ideal broadcasting of noncommuting mixed states is possible, but one can even purify the state in the process. Such state purification with an increasing number of copies has been named "superbroadcasting". In this paper we will review some recent results on superbroadcasting of qubits, for two different sets of input states, corresponding to universally covariant broadcasting and to phase-covariant broadcasting of equatorial states.

abstract: The mechanism of describing quantum states by standard probability (tomographic one) instead of wave function or density matrix is elucidated. Quantum tomography is formulated in an abstract Hilbert space framework, by means of the identity decompositions in the Hilbert space of hermitian linear operators, with trace formula as scalar product of operators. Decompositions of identity are considered with respect to over-complete families of projectors labeled by extra parameters and containing a measure, depending on these parameters. It plays the role of a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization kernel. When the measure is equal to one, the decomposition of identity coincides with a positive operator valued measure (POVM) decomposition. Examples of spin tomography, photon number tomography and symplectic tomography are reconsidered in this new framework.

abstract: We show how a classically vanishing interaction generates entanglement between two initially nonentangled particles, without affecting their classical dynamics. For chaotic dynamics, the rate of entanglement is shown to saturate at the Lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics as the interaction strength increases. In the saturation regime, the one-particle Wigner function follows classical dynamics better and better as one goes deeper and deeper in the semiclassical limit. This demonstrates that quantum-classical correspondence at the microscopic level requires neither high temperatures, nor coupling to a large number of external degrees of freedom.

abstract: We obtain the optimal scheme for estimating unknown qubit mixed states when an arbitrary number N of identically prepared copies is available. We discuss the case of states in the whole Bloch sphere as well as the restricted situation where these states are known to lie on the equatorial plane. For the former case we obtain that the optimal measurement does not depend on the prior probability distribution provided it is isotropic. Although the equatorial-plane case does not have this property for arbitrary N, we give a prior-independent scheme which becomes optimal in the asymptotic limit of large N. We compute the maximum mean fidelity in this asymptotic regime for the two cases. We show that within the pointwise estimation approach these limits can be obtained in a rather easy and rapid way. This derivation is based on heuristic arguments that are made rigorous by using van Trees inequalities. The interrelation between the estimation of the purity and the direction of the state is also discussed. In the general case we show that they correspond to independent estimations whereas for the equatorial-plane states this is only true asymptotically.

abstract: We introduce an interference measure which allows to quantify the amount of interference present in any physical process that maps an initial density matrix to a final density matrix. In particular, the interference measure enables one to monitor the amount of interference generated in each step of a quantum algorithm. We show that a Hadamard gate acting on a single qubit is a basic building block for interference generation and realizes one bit of interference, an ``i-bit''. We use the interference measure to quantify interference for various examples, including Grover's search algorithm and Shor's factorization algorithm. We distinguish between ``potentially available'' and ``actually used'' interference, and show that for both algorithms the potentially available interference is exponentially large. However, the amount of interference actually used in Grover's algorithm is only about 3 i-bits and asymptotically independent of the number of qubits, while Shor's algorithm indeed uses an exponential amount of interference.

abstract: We propose a ``channelization'' architecture to achieve wide-band electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and ultra-slow light propagation in atomic Rb-87 vapors. EIT and slow light are achieved by shining a strong, resonant ``pump'' laser on the atomic medium, which allows slow and unattenuated propagation of a weaker ``signal'' beam, but only when a two-photon resonance condition is satisfied. Our wideband architecture is accomplished by dispersing a wideband signal spatially, transverse to the propagation direction, prior to entering the atomic cell. When particular Zeeman sub-levels are used in the EIT system, then one can introduce a magnetic field with a linear gradient such that the two-photon resonance condition is satisfied for each individual frequency component. Because slow light is a group velocity effect, utilizing differential phase shifts across the spectrum of a light pulse, one must then introduce a slight mismatch from perfect resonance to induce a delay. We present a model which accounts for diffusion of the atoms in the varying magnetic field as well as interaction with levels outside the ideal three-level system on which EIT is based. We find the maximum delay-bandwidth product decreases with bandwidth, and that delay-bandwidth product ~1 should be achievable with bandwidth ~50 MHz (~5 ns delay). This is a large improvement over the ~1 MHz bandwidths in conventional slow light systems and could be of use in signal processing applications.

abstract: A quantum processor is a programmable quantum circuit in which both the data and the program, which specifies the operation that is carried out on the data, are quantum states. We study the situation in which we want to use such a processor to approximate a set of unitary operators to a specified level of precision. We measure how well an operation is performed by the process fidelity between the desired operation and the operation produced by the processor. We show how to find the program for a given processor that produces the best approximation of a particular unitary operation. We also place bounds on the dimension of the program space that is necessary to approximate a set of unitary operators to a specified level of precision.

Two different situations are considered:(a) s1 ->\infty, s2 = 1/2 and (b) s1 = s2 ->\infty, corresponding, respectively, to a quantum degree of freedom coupled to a semiclassical one (a qubit in contact with an environment) and a fully semiclassical system, which in this case displays chaotic behavior. Relations between quantum entanglement and classical dynamics are investigated.

abstract: We discuss the problem of implementing generalized measurements (POVMs) with linear optics, either based upon a static linear array or including conditional dynamics. In our approach, a given POVM shall be identified as a solution to an optimization problem for a chosen cost function. We formulate a general principle: the implementation is only possible if a linear-optics circuit exists for which the quantum mechanical optimum (minimum) is still attainable after dephasing the corresponding quantum states. The general principle enables us, for instance, to derive a set of necessary conditions for the linear-optics implementation of the POVM that realizes the quantum mechanically optimal unambiguous discrimination of two pure nonorthogonal states. This extends our previous results on projection measurements and the exact discrimination of orthogonal states.

abstract: A quantum system weakly interacting with a fast environment usually undergoes a relaxation with complex frequencies whose imaginary parts are damping rates quadratic in the coupling to the environment, in accord with Fermi's ``Golden Rule''. We show for various models (spin damped by harmonic-oscillator or random-matrix baths, quantum diffusion, quantum Brownian motion) that upon increasing the coupling up to a critical value still small enough to allow for weak-coupling Markovian master equations, a new relaxation regime can occur. In that regime, complex frequencies lose their real parts such that the process becomes overdamped. Our results call into question the standard belief that overdamping is exclusively a strong coupling feature.

abstract: The traversal of an elliptically polarized optical field through a thermal vapour cell can give rise to a rotation of its polarization axis. This process, known as polarization self-rotation (PSR), has been suggested as a mechanism for producing squeezed light at atomic transition wavelengths. In this paper, we show results of the characterization of PSR in isotopically enhanced Rubidium-87 cells, performed in two independent laboratories. We observed that, contrary to earlier work, the presence of atomic noise in the thermal vapour overwhelms the observation of squeezing. We present a theory that contains atomic noise terms and show that a null result in squeezing is consistent with this theory.

abstract: We propose a scheme of continuous-variable reversible telecloning, which broadcast the information of an unknown state without loss from a sender to several spatially separated receivers exploiting multipartite entanglement as quantum channels. In this scheme, quantum information of an unknown state is distributed into $M$ optimal clones and $M-1$ anticlones using $2M$% -partite entanglement. For the perfect quantum information distribution that is optimal cloning, $2M$-partite entanglement is required to be a maximum two-party entanglement. Comparing with the quantum telecloning proposed by Loock and Braunstein [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 247901 (2001)], this protocol produces the anticlones (or time-reversed state) of the unknown quantum state, thus, keep all information of an unknown state.

abstract: Bell's theorem states that no local realistic explanation of quantum mechanical predictions is possible, in which the experimenter has a freedom to choose between different measurement settings. Within a local realistic picture the violation of Bell's inequalities can only be understood if this freedom is denied. We determine the minimal degree to which the experimenter's freedom has to be abandoned, if one wants to keep such a picture and be in agreement with the experiment. Furthermore, the freedom in choosing experimental arrangements may be considered as a resource, since its lacking can be used by an eavesdropper to harm the security of quantum communication. We analyze the security of quantum key distribution as a function of the (partial) knowledge the eavesdropper has about the future choices of measurement settings which are made by the authorized parties (e.g. on the basis of some quasi-random generator). We show that the equivalence between the violation of Bell's inequality and the efficient extraction of a secure key - which exists for the case of complete freedom (no setting knowledge) - is lost unless one adapts the bound of the inequality according to this lack of freedom.

As an example, we present two coupled spin-$\frac 1 2 $ particles to detail the calculations.

abstract: Going beyond the entanglement of microscopic objects (such as photons, spins, and ions), here we propose an efficient approach to produce and control the quantum entanglement of three macroscopic coupled superconducting qubits. By conditionally rotating, one by one, selected Josephson charge qubits, we show that their Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled states can be deterministically generated. The existence of GHZ correlations between these qubits could be experimentally demonstrated by effective single-qubit operations followed by high-fidelity single-shot readouts. The possibility of using the prepared GHZ correlations to test the macroscopic conflict between the noncommutativity of quantum mechanics and the commutativity of classical physics is also discussed.

abstract: Based on our previous publication [U. Herzog and J. A. Bergou, Phys.Rev. A 71, 050301(R) (2005)] we investigate the optimum measurement for the unambiguous discrimination of two mixed quantum states that occur with given prior probabilities. Unambiguous discrimination of nonorthogonal states is possible in a probabilistic way, at the expense of a nonzero probability of inconclusive results, where the measurement fails. Along with a discussion of the general problem, we give an example illustrating our method of solution. We also provide general inequalities for the minimum achievable failure probability and discuss in more detail the necessary conditions that must be fulfilled when its absolute lower bound, proportional to the fidelity of the states, can be reached.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion (NMQSD) is a non-relativistic but otherwise exact theory which expresses the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary subsystem, interacting linearly with an uncoupled harmonic oscillator bath, as an average of diadics formed from state vectors which obey stochastic variational-differential equations. The vacuum radiation field can be represented as such an oscillator bath, and so this model is in widespread use in quantum optics. Prior to the development of NMQSD, exact subsystem solutions could only be obtained in a few special cases (e.g. spin-1/2, harmonic oscillator). Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to obtain exact solutions to new problems using NMQSD due to the difficulty of solving the variational-differential equations. Here we show that these equations can be transformed into a pair of coupled nonlinear integrodifferential equations. We develop exact numerical methods for the integrodifferential equations and show that solutions can be readily obtained to good accuracy for quite general subsystems. We exactly solve various examples including tunneling in a double well representing molecular isomerization or racemization, suppression of fluorescence from a two-level atom in a band gap, and intermittent fluorescence from a driven three level system representing electronic states of singly ionized magnesium.

The solutions presented here may be adventageous in the design of semiconductor devices.

abstract: Using the spectral distribution associated with the adjacency matrix of graphs, we introduce a new method of calculation of amplitudes of continuous-time quantum walk on some rather important graphs, such as line, cycle graph $C_n$, complete graph $K_n$, graph $G_n$, finite path and some other finite and infinite graphs, where all are connected with orthogonal polynomials such as Hermite, Laguerre, Tchebichef and some other orthogonal polynomials. It is shown that using the spectral distribution, one can obtain the infinite time asymptotic behavior of amplitudes simply by using the method of stationary phase approximation(WKB approximation), where as an example, the method is applied to star, two-dimensional comb lattices, infinite Hermite and Laguerre graphs. Also by using the Gauss quadrature formula one can approximate infinite graphs with finite ones and vice versa, in order to derive large time asymptotic behavior by WKB method. Likewise, using this method, some new graphs are introduced, where their amplitude are proportional to product of amplitudes of some elementary graphs, even though the graphs themselves are not the same as Cartesian product of their elementary graphs. Finally, via calculating mean end to end distance of some infinite graphs at large enough times, it is shown that continuous time quantum walk at different infinite graphs belong to different universality classes which are also different than those of the corresponding classical ones.

abstract: Most experimental demonstrations of entanglement require nonclassical states and correlated measurements of single-photon detection events. It is shown here that entanglement can produce a large decrease in the rate of two-photon absorption for a classical input state that can be observed using classical detectors. These effects can be interpreted as being due to the creation of entangled photon holes that are somewhat analogous to the holes of semiconductor theory.

We show that it is better than the plug-in predictive density operator based on the maximum likelihood estimate by calculating each average relative entropy.

abstract: The time-convolutionless (TCL) projection operator technique allows a systematic analysis of the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems. We introduce a class of projection superoperators which project the states of the total system onto certain correlated system-environment states. It is shown that the application of the TCL technique to this class of correlated superoperators enables the non-perturbative treatment of the dynamics of system-environment models for which the standard approach fails in any finite order of the coupling strength. We demonstrate further that the correlated superoperators correspond to the idea of a best guess of conditional quantum expectations which is determined by a suitable Hilbert space average. The general approach is illustrated by means of the model of a spin which interacts through randomly distributed couplings with a finite reservoir consisting of two energy bands. Extensive numerical simulations of the full Schroedinger equation of the model reveal the power and efficiency of the method.

abstract: Quantum algorithm can find target item in a database faster than any classical. One can trade accuracy for speed and find a part of the database (a block) containing the target item even faster: this is partial search. One can think of partial search in following terms: an exact address of the target item is given by a sequence of many bites, but we want to find only several first bites of the address. We consider different partial search algorithms consisting of a sequence of global and local searches and suggest the optimal one. Global search consists of the standard Grover iterations for the whole database. Local search consists of Grover iterations in each individual block made simultaneously in all blocks. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by number of queries to the oracle.

abstract: We review here the main contributions of Einstein to the quantum theory. To put them in perspective we first give an account of Physics as it was before him. It is followed by a brief account of the problem of black body radiation which provided the context for Planck to introduce the idea of quantum. Einstein's revolutionary paper of 1905 on light-quantum hypothesis is then described as well as an application of this idea to the photoelectric effect. We next take up a discussion of Einstein's other contributions to old quantum theory. These include (i) his theory of specific heat of solids, which was the first application of quantum theory to matter, (ii) his discovery of wave-particle duality for light and (iii) Einstein's A and B coefficients relating to the probabilities of emission and absorption of light by atomic systems and his discovery of radiation stimulated emission of light which provides the basis for laser action. We then describe Einstein's contribution to quantum statistics viz Bose-Einstein Statistics and his prediction of Bose-Einstein condensation of a boson gas. Einstein played a pivotal role in the discovery of Quantum mechanics and this is briefly mentioned. After 1925 Einstein's contributed mainly to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. We choose to discuss here (i) his Ensemble (or Statistical) Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and (ii) the discovery of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations and the EPR theorem on the conflict between Einstein-Locality and the completeness of the formalism of Quantum Mechanics. We end with some comments on later developments.

abstract: Suppose we are given two identical copies of an unknown quantum state and we wish to delete one copy from among the given two copies. The quantum no-deletion principle restricts us from perfectly deleting a copy but it does not prohibit us from deleting a copy approximately. Here we construct two types of a universal quantum deletion machine which approximately deletes a copy such that the fidelity of deletion does not depend on the input state. The two types of universal quantum deletion machines are (1) a conventional deletion machine described by one unitary operator and (2) a modified deletion machine described by two unitary operators. Here it is shown that modified deletion machine deletes a qubit with fidelity 0.75, which is the maximum limit for deleting an unknown quantum state. In addition to this we also show that the modified deletion machine retains the qubit in the first mode with average fidelity 0.77 (approx.) which is slightly greater than the fidelity of measurement for two given identical state, showing how precisely one can determine its state [13]. We also show that the deletion machine itself is input state independent i.e. the information is not hidden in the deleting machine, and hence we can delete the information completely from the deletion machine.

abstract: Most investigations devoted to the conditions for adiabatic quantum computing are based on the first-order correction ${\bra{\Psi_{\rm ground}(t)}\dot H(t)\ket{\Psi_{\rm excited}(t)} /\Delta E^2(t)\ll1}$. However, it is demonstrated that this first-order correction does not yield a good estimate for the computational error. Therefore, a more general criterion is proposed, which includes higher-order corrections as well and shows that the computational error can be made exponentially small -- which facilitates significantly shorter evolution times than the above first-order estimate in certain situations. Based on this criterion and rather general arguments and assumptions, it can be demonstrated that a run-time $T$ of order of the inverse minimum energy gap $\Delta E_{\rm min}$ is sufficient and necessary, i.e., $T=\ord(\Delta E_{\rm min}^{-1})$. For some examples, these analytical investigations are confirmed by numerical simulations. PACS: 03.67.Lx, 03.67.-a.

abstract: We analyze the geometric phase for an open quantum system when computed by resorting to a stochastic unravelling of the reduced density matrix (quantum jump approach or stochastic Schrodienger equations). We show that the resulting phase strongly depends on the type of unravelling used for the calculations: as such, this phase is 'not' a geometric object since it depends on non-physical parameters which are not related to the path followed by the density matrix during the evolution of the system.

abstract: We consider an approach to deciding isomorphism of rigid n-vertex graphs (and related isomorphism problems) by solving a nonabelian hidden shift problem on a quantum computer using the standard method. Such an approach is arguably more natural than viewing the problem as a hidden subgroup problem. We prove that the hidden shift approach to rigid graph isomorphism is hard in two senses. First, we prove that Omega(n) copies of the hidden shift states are necessary to solve the problem (whereas O(n log n) copies are sufficient). Second, we prove that if one is restricted to single-register measurements, an exponential number of hidden shift states are required.

abstract: We investigate the relation between the entanglement properties of a quantum state and its energy for macroscopic spin models. To this aim, we develop a general method to compute energy bounds for states without certain forms of multipartite entanglement. Violation of these bounds implies the presence of these types of multipartite entanglement. As examples, we investigate the Heisenberg model in different dimensions, the Ising model and the XX model in the presence of a magnetic field. Finally, by studying the Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, we demonstrate that our techniques can be applied also to frustrated systems.

abstract: We consider entanglement distillation from a single-copy of a multipartite state, and instead of rates we analyze the "quality" of the distilled entanglement. This "quality" is quantified by the fidelity with the GHZ-state. We show that each not fully-separable state $\sigma$ can increase the "quality" of the entanglement distilled from other states, no matter how weakly entangled is $\sigma$. We also generalize this to the case where the goal is distilling states different than the GHZ. These results provide new insights on the geometry of the set of separable states and its dual (the set of entanglement witnesses).

The scheme works only with particle statistics and local operations, without the need of any other interactions. We show that the maximally entangled state can be distilled out when the initial state is pure, otherwise the entanglement of the final state is less than one. The distillation efficiency is a product of the diagonal elements of the initial state, it takes the maximum 50%, the same as the case for pure states.

abstract: The role of geometry on dispersive forces is investigated by calculating the energy between different spheroidal particles and planar surfaces, both with arbitrary dielectric properties. The energy is obtained in the non-retarded limit using a spectral representation formalism and calculating the interaction between the surface plasmons of the two macroscopic bodies. The energy is a power-law function of the separation of the bodies, where the exponent value depends on the geometrical parameters of the system, like the separation distance between bodies, and the aspect ratio among minor and major axes of the spheroid.

abstract: In standard coherent state teleportation with shared two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state there is a trade-off between the teleportation fidelity and the fidelity of estimation of the teleported state from results of the Bell measurement. Within the class of Gaussian operations this trade-off is optimal, i.e. there is not a Gaussian operation which would give for a given output fidelity a larger estimation fidelity. We show that this trade-off can be improved by up to 2.77% if we use a suitable non-Gaussian operation. This operation can be implemented by the standard teleportation protocol in which the shared TMSV state is replaced with a suitable non-Gaussian entangled state. We also demonstrate that this operation can be used to enhance the transmission fidelity of a certain noisy channel.

Experimentally we reach near optimal performance, limited only by detection inefficiencies. In addition we show that such a scheme can be used to enhance the transmission fidelity of a class of noisy channels.

abstract: In this paper a programmable quantum state discriminator is implemented by using nuclear magnetic resonance. We use a two qubit spin-1/2 system, one for the data qubit and one for the ancilla (programme) qubit. This device does the unambiguous (error free) discrimination of pair of states of the data qubit that are symmetrically located about a fixed state. The device is used to discriminate both, linearly polarized states and elliptically polarized states. The maximum probability of the successful discrimination is achieved by suitably preparing the ancilla qubit. It is also shown that, the probability of discrimination depends on angle of unitary operator of the protocol and ellipticity of the data qubit state.

abstract: Now, the known ensembles of orthogonal states which are distinguishable by local operators and classical communication (LOCC) satisfy the condition that the sum of Schmidit numbers of the orthogonal states is not bigger than the dimensions of the whole space. A natural question is whether an arbitary ensembles of LOCC-distinguishable orthogonal states satisfies the condition. We first show that, in this paper, the answer is positive. Then we generalize it into multipartite systems, and show that a necessary condition for LOCC-distinguishability of multipartite orthogonal quantum states is that the sum of the least numbers of the product states (For bipartite system, the least number of product states is Schmidit number) of the orthogonal states is not bigger than the dimensions of the Hilbert space of the multipartite system. This necessary condition is very simple and general, and one can get many cases of indistinguishability by it. It means that the least number of the product states acts an important role in distinguishablity of states, and implies that the least number of the product states may be an good manifestion of quantum nonlocality in some sense. In fact, entanglement emphases the "amount" of nonlocality, but the least number of the product states emphases the types of nonlocality. For example, the known W states and GHZ states have different least number of the product states, and are different in type.

comments: 15 pages, no figure

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510199
abstract: The Einstein, Podolski and Rosen (EPR) argument aiming to prove the incompleteness of quantum mechanics (QM) was opposed by most EPR's contemporary physicists and is not accepted within the standard interpretation of QM, which maintains that QM is a complete theory. An analysis of the semantic implications of the opponent positions shows that they imply different notions of truth. The introduction of a nonclassical notion of truth within the standard interpretation is usually justified by referring to known theorems that should prove that QM is a contextual and nonlocal theory. However, these theorems are based on a doubtful implicit epistemological assumption. If one renounces it, one can provide an alternative interpretation of QM that it realistic in a semantic sense. Within this interpretation the EPR viewpoint is recovered and QM is considered a (semantically) incomplete, noncontextual and local theory. Furthermore, the new interpretation provides several suggestions for constructing a more general theory embedding QM and for connecting QM with classical physics and relativity.

The states thus constructed may find applications in many areas related to quantum information science including quantum cryptography, optimal Bell tests and investigation of enhancement of channel capacity due to entanglement.

This theorem holds for individual events with no inequalities, for detectors of 100% efficiency.

abstract: We describe a quantum repeater protocol for long-distance quantum communication. In this scheme, entanglement is created between qubits at intermediate stations of the channel by using a weak dispersive light-matter interaction and distributing the outgoing bright coherent light pulses among the stations. Noisy entangled pairs of electronic spin are then prepared with high success probability via homodyne detection and postselection. The local gates for entanglement purification and swapping are deterministic and measurement-free, based upon the same coherent-light resources and weak interactions as for the initial entanglement distribution. Finally, the entanglement is stored in a nuclear-spin-based quantum memory. With our system, qubit-communication rates approaching 100 Hz over 1280 km with fidelities near 99% are possible for reasonable local gate errors.

Linear functionals and dual spaces are considered and properties of linear operators are obtained; in particular it is established that the eigenvalues of a bicomplex self-adjoint operator are in the set of hyperbolic numbers.

We show how the entanglement depends on the locations of the two fermions and the total number of particles. Fermions at the verge of trap have longer entanglement distance (beyond it, the entanglement disappears) than those in the center. We derive a lower limitation to the average overlapping for two entangled fermions in the BCS ground state, it is shown to be $\sqrt{Q/2M}$, a function of Cooper pair number $Q$ and total number of occupied energy levels $M$.

abstract: We again consider (as in a companion paper) an entangled two-particle state that is produced from two independent down-conversion sources by the process of "entanglement-swapping", so that the particles have never met. We show that there is a natural extension of the Einstein-Pololsky-Rosen discussion of "elements of reality" to include inefficient detectors. We consider inefficient deterministic, local, realistic models of quantum theory that are "robust", which we consider to be the minimum requirement for them to be taken seriously. By robust, we mean they satisfy the following three criteria: (a) they reproduce the quantum results for perfect correlations, if all particles are detected; (b) they produce some counts for every setting of the angles (so they don't describe some experiments that can easily be performed as "impossible"); (c) all their hidden variables are relevant (they must each produce a detectable result in some experiment). For such models we prove a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type theorem for arbitrary detection efficiencies, showing that any such theory is inconsistent with the quantum mechanical perfect correlations. This theorem holds for individual events with no inequalities. As a result, the theorem is also independent of any random sampling hypothesis.

abstract: We present three quantum key distribution protocols using entangled state. In the first two protocols, all Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs are used to distribute a secret key except those chosen for eavesdropping check, because the communication parties measure each of their particles in an invariable measuring basis. The first protocol is based on the ideal of qubit transmission in blocks. Although it need quantum memory, its theoretic efficiency approximates to 100%. The second protocol does not need quantum memory and its efficiency for qubits can achieve 100%. In the third protocol, we present a controlled quantum key distribution using three-particle entangled state to solve a special cryptographic task. Only with the controller's permission could the communication parties establish their sharing key and the sharing key is secret to the controller. We also analyze the security and the efficiency of the present protocols.

We detailedly describe the protocols in the cases of one qubit, respectively, with one controller and with two senders. Then we extend the protocols to the cases of multiqubits with many controllers and two senders. Because our protocols have to demand the controller(s)'s startup and authorization or two senders together working and cooperations, the controlled and combined remote implementations of quantum operations definitely can enhance the security of remote quantum information processing and potentially have more applications. Moreover, our protocol with two senders is helpful to farthest arrive at the power of remote implementations of quantum operations in theory since the different senders perhaps have different operational resources and different operational rights in practice.

We show that the skew Anosov properties can be interpreted as regular Anosov properties in an enlarged Hilbert space, in the framework of a generalized Floquet theory. This extension allows us to describe the hyperbolicity properties of almost-periodic quantum parametric oscillators and we show that their upper Lyapunov exponents are positive and equal to the Lyapunov exponent of the corresponding classical parametric oscillators. As second example, we show that the configurational quantum cat system satisfies quantum Anosov properties.

abstract: In this paper, we present an (n, n) threshold quantum secret sharing scheme of secure direct communication using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. The present scheme is efficient in that all the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states used in the quantum secret sharing scheme are used to generate shared secret messages except those chosen for checking eavesdropper. In our scheme, the measuring basis of communication parties is invariable and the classical information used to check eavesdropping needs only the results of measurements of the communication parties. Another nice feature of our scheme is that the sender transmit her secret messages to the receivers directly and the receivers recover the sender's secret by combining their results, different from the QSS scheme whose object is essentially to allow a sender to establish a shared key with the receivers. This feature of our scheme is similar to that of quantum secret direct communication.

abstract: We present the design and experimental proof of principle of a low threshold optical parametric oscillator (OPO) that continuously oscillates over a large bandwidth allowed by phase matching. The large oscillation bandwidth is achieved with a selective two-photon loss that suppresses the inherent mode competition, which tends to narrow the bandwidth in conventional OPOs. Our design performs pairwise mode-locking of many frequency pairs, in direct equivalence to passive mode-locking of ultrashort pulsed lasers. The ability to obtain high powers of continuous \textit{and} broadband down-converted light enables the optimal exploitation of the correlations within the down-converted spectrum, thereby strongly affecting two-photon interactions even at classically high power levels, and opening new venues for applications such as two-photon spectroscopy and microscopy and optical spread spectrum communication.

We consider the quantum dynamics of a continuously monitored two level system interacting with a squeezed bath. We find that the behavior of the system depends critically on the way in which the squeezed bath is prepared. For specific choices of the squeezing phase the system shows Zeno or anti-Zeno effect in conditions for which it would decay exponentially if no measurements were done. This result allows for a clear interpretation in terms of the equivalent spin system interacting with a fictitious magnetic field.

abstract: We report on a study of the long-term stability and absolute accuracy of an atom interferometer gyroscope. This study included the implementation of an electro-optical technique to reverse the vector area of the interferometer for reduced systematics and a careful study of systematic phase shifts. Our data strongly suggests that drifts less than 96 $\mu$deg/hr are possible after empirically removing shifts due to measured changes in temperature, laser intensity, and several other experimental parameters.

abstract: Although it has been known for some time that quantum mechanics can be formulated in a way that treats prediction and retrodiction on an equal footing, most attention in engineering quantum states has been devoted to predictive states, that is, states associated with the a preparation event. Retrodictive states, which are associated with a measurement event and propagate backwards in time, are also useful, however. In this paper we show how any retrodictive state of light that can be written to a good approximation as a finite superposition of photon number states can be generated by an optical multiport device. The composition of the state is adjusted by controlling predictive coherent input states. We show how the probability of successful state generation can be optimised by adjusting the multiport device and also examine a versatile configuration that is useful for generating a range of states.

abstract: We report new results regarding a source of polarization entangled photon-pairs created by the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion in two orthogonally oriented, periodically poled, bulk KTiOPO4 crystals (PPKTP). The source emits light colinearly at the non-degenerate wavelengths of 810 nm and 1550 nm, and is optimized for single-mode optical fiber collection and long-distance quantum communication. The configuration favors long crystals, which promote a high photon-pair production rate at a narrow bandwidth, together with a high pair-probability in fibers. The quality of entanglement is limited by chromatic dispersion, which we analyze by determining the output state. We find that such a decoherence effect is strongly material dependent, providing for long crystals an upper bound on the visibility of the coincidence fringes of 41% for KTiOPO4, and zero for LiNbO3. The best obtained raw visibility, when canceling decoherence with an extra piece of crystal, was 91 \pm 0.2%, including background counts. We confirm by a violation of the CHSH-inequality (S = 2.679 \pm 0.004 at 55 s^{-1/2} standard deviations) and by complete quantum state tomography that the fibers carry high-quality entangled pairs at a maximum rate of 55 x 10^3 s^{-1}THz^{-1}mW^{-1}.

abstract: An approximate method is suggested to obtain analytical expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the some quantum optical models. The method is based on the Lie-type transformation of the Hamiltonians. In a particular case it is demonstrated that $E\times \epsilon $ Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian can easily be solved within the framework of the suggested approximation. The method presented here is conceptually simple and can easily be extended to the other quantum optical models. We also show that for a purely imaginary coupling the $E\times \epsilon $ Hamiltonian becomes non-Hermitian but $P\sigma _{0}$-symmetric. Possible generalization of this approach is outlined.

abstract: We observed electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and dark fluorescence in a cascade three-level diatomic Lithium system using Optical-Optical Double Resonance (OODR) spectroscopy. When a strong coupling laser couples the intermediate state $A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}(v=13, J=14)$ to the upper state $G^{1}\Pi_{g}(v=11, J=14)$ of $^7Li_2$, the fluorescence from both $A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}$ and $G^{1}\Pi_{g}$ states was drastically reduced as the weak probe laser was tuned through the resonance transition between the ground state $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}(v=4, J=15)$ and the excited state $A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}(v=13, J=14)$. The strong coupling laser makes an optically thick medium transparent for the probe transition. In addition, The fact that fluorescence from the upper state $G^{1}\Pi_{g}(v=11, J=14)$ was also dark when both lasers were tuned at resonance implies that the molecules were trapped in the ground state. We used density matrix methods to simulate the response of an open molecular three-level system to the action of a strong coupling field and a weak probe field. The analytical solutions were obtained under the steady-state condition. We have incorporated the magnetic sublevel (M) degeneracy of the rotational levels in the lineshape analysis and report $|M|$ dependent lineshape splitting. The theoretical calculations are in excellent agreement with the observed fluorescence spectra. We show that the coherence is remarkably preserved even when the coupling field was detuned far from the resonance.

This synthesis arises very naturally from the physics of the problem, as it relies on the variance associated with the quantum filtering process.

abstract: The interaction between an atom and a one mode external driving field is an ubiquitous problem in many branches of physics and is often modeled using the Rabi Hamiltonian. In this paper we present a series of analytically solvable Hamiltonians that approximate the Rabi Hamiltonian and compare our results to the Jaynes-Cummings model which neglects the so-called counter-rotating term in the Rabi Hamiltonian. Through a unitary transformation that diagonlizes the Jaynes-Cummings model, we transform the counter-rotating term into separate terms representing several different physical processes. By keeping only certain terms, we can achieve an excellent approximation to the exact dynamics within specified parameter ranges.

abstract: We show that a waveguide that is normally opaque due to interaction with a drop-filter cavity can be made transparent when the drop filter is also coupled to a dipole. A transparency condition is derived between the cavity lifetime and vacuum Rabi frequency of the dipole. This condition is much weaker than strong coupling, and amounts to simply achieving large Purcell factors. Thus, we can observe transparency in the weak coupling regime. We describe how this effect can be useful for designing quantum repeaters for long distance quantum communication.

abstract: This paper introduces a new technique for removing existential quantifiers over quantum states. Using this technique, we show that there is no way to pack an exponential number of bits into a polynomial-size quantum state, in such a way that the value of any one of those bits can later be proven with the help of a polynomial-size quantum witness. We also show that any problem in QMA with polynomial-size quantum advice, is also in PSPACE with polynomial-size classical advice. This builds on our earlier result that BQP/qpoly is contained in PP/poly, and offers an intriguing counterpoint to the recent discovery of Raz that QIP/qpoly = ALL. Finally, we show that QCMA/qpoly is contained in PP/poly and that QMA/rpoly = QMA/poly.

We show that if the number of qubits each party holds is large the state will be close to maximally entangled with probability exponentially close to one. We provide a similar tight characterization of the entanglement present in the maximally mixed state of a randomly chosen stabilizer code. Finally, we show that typically very few GHZ states can be extracted from a random multipartite stabilizer state via local unitary operations. Our main tool is a new concentration inequality which bounds deviations from the mean of random variables which are naturally defined on the Clifford group.

abstract: The question how to quantize a classical system where an angle phi is one of the basic canonical variables has been controversial since the early days of quantum mechanics. The problem is that the angle is a multivalued or discontinuous variable on the corresponding phase space. The remedy is to replace phi by the smooth periodic functions cos phi and sin phi. In the case of the canonical pair (phi,l),l: orbital angular momentum (OAM), the phase space S_(phi,l) ={phi in R mod 2pi, l in R} has the global structure S^1 x R of a cylinder on which the Poisson brackets of the 3 functions cos phi, sin phi and l obey the Lie algebra of the euclidean group E(2) in the plane. This property provides the basis for the quantization of the system in terms of irreducible unitary representations of the group E(2) or of its covering groups. A crucial point is that - due to the fact that the subgroup SO(2) = S^1 is multiply connected - these representations allow for fractional OAM l = n + c, c in [0,1). Such c not 0 have already been observed in cases like the Aharonov-Bohm and the fractional quantum Hall effects and they correspond to the quasi-momenta of Bloch waves in ideal crystals. The proposal of the present paper is to look for fractional OAM in connection with the quantum optics of Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes in external magnetic fields. The quantum theory of the phase space S_(phi,l) in terms of unitary representations of E(2) allows for two types of "coherent" states the properties of which are discussed in detail: Non-holomorphic minimal uncertainty states and holomorphic ones associated with Bargmann-Segal Hilbert spaces.

abstract: We present a simple protocol to purify a coherent-state superposition that has undergone a linear lossy channel. The scheme constitutes only a single beam splitter and a homodyne detector, and thus is experimentally feasible. In practice, a superposition of coherent states is transformed into a classical mixture of coherent states by linear loss, which is usually the dominant decoherence mechanism in optical systems. We also address the possibility of producing a larger amplitude superposition state from decohered states, and show that in most cases the decoherence of the states are amplified along with the amplitude.

This inequality gives a way to experimentally classify the observed state of multipartite systems of an arbitrary dimension. The inequality also implies that a sufficient condition for a density operator to have no positive partial transpose with respect to any subsystem is that the fidelity to a generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state {[A.

abstract: We present a class of observables which are suitable for determining the fidelity of a state to the multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. Given an expectation value of an observable belonging to the class, we give a simple formula that gives a lower bound and an upper bound for the fidelity. Applying the formula to the GHZ-state preparation experiment by Pan {\it et al}. {[Nature (London) {\bf 403}, 515 (2000)]}, we show that the observed state lies outside of the class of biseparable mixed three-qubit states. We also show that for this class of operators, adopting the principle of minimum variance {[Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60}, 4338 (1999)]} in the state estimation always results in the state with the minimum fidelity.

abstract: We propose quantization relationships which would let us describe and solution problems originated by conflicting or cooperative behaviors among the members of a system from the point of view of quantum mechanical interactions. The quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is the equation of evolution of mixed states from quantum statistical mechanics. A system and all its members will cooperate and rearrange its states to improve their present condition. They strive to reach the best possible state for each of them which is also the best possible state for the whole system. This led us to propose a quantum equilibrium in which a system is stable only if it maximizes the welfare of the collective above the welfare of the individual. If it is maximized the welfare of the individual above the welfare of the collective the system gets unstable and eventually it collapses.

abstract: In spite of the macroscopic character of the fluctuation amplitudes, we show that the standard inflationary distribution of primordial density fluctuations still exhibits inherently quantum mechanical correlations (which cannot be mimicked by any classical stochastic ensemble). To this end, we propose a Gedanken experiment for which certain Bell inequalities are violated. We also compute the effect of decoherence and show that the violation persists provided that the decoherence lies below a certain non-vanishing threshold. Moreover, there exists a higher threshold above which no violation of any Bell inequalities can occur, so that the corresponding distributions can be interpreted as stochastic ensembles of classical fluctuations.

At the same time an accelerating expansion of the Universe is explained by the influence of small negative cosmological constant. A comparison with the model with positive cosmological constant (dark energy) which also has obtained its theoretical grounds in a structure of the developed formalism is made. Parameters of the Universe in the states with large quantum numbers are calculated.

abstract: A theoretical spectroscopic analysis of a microwave driven superconducting charge qubit (Cooper-pair box coupled) to an RLC oscillator model is performed. By treating the oscillator as a probe through the backreaction effect of the qubit on the oscillator circuit, we extract frequency splitting features analogous to the Autler-Townes effect from quantum optics, thereby extending the analogies between superconducting and quantum optical phenomenology. These features are found in a frequency band that avoids the need for high frequency measurement systems and therefore may be of use in qubit characterization and coupling schemes. In addition we find this frequency band can be adjusted to suit an experimental frequency regime by changing the oscillator frequency.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0510236
abstract: We analyse the quantum dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a normal-state single-electron transistor (SET). Starting from a microscopic description of the system, we derive a master equation for the SET island charge and resonator which is valid in the limit of weak electro-mechanical coupling. Using this master equation we show that, apart from brief transients, the resonator always behaves like a damped harmonic oscillator with a shifted frequency and relaxes into a thermal-like steady state. Although the behaviour remains qualitatively the same, we find that the magnitude of the resonator damping rate and frequency shift depend very sensitively on the relative magnitudes of the resonator period and the electron tunnelling time. Maximum damping occurs when the electrical and mechanical time-scales are the same, but the frequency shift is greatest when the resonator moves much more slowly than the island charge. We then derive reduced master equations which describe just the resonator dynamics. By making slightly different approximations, we obtain two different reduced master equations for the resonator. Apart from minor differences, the two reduced master equations give rise to a consistent picture of the resonator dynamics which matches that obtained from the master equation including the SET island charge.

abstract: We consider the finite-size corrections in the Dicke model and determine the scaling exponents at the critical point for several quantities such as the ground state energy or the gap. Therefore, we use the Holstein-Primakoff representation of the angular momentum and introduce a nonlinear transformation to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the normal phase. As already observed in several systems, these corrections turn out to be singular at the transition point and thus lead to nontrivial exponents. We show that for the atomic observables, these exponents are the same as in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, in agreement with numerical results. We also investigate the behavior of the order parameter related to the radiation mode and show that it is driven by the same scaling variable as the atomic one.

abstract: In these lecture notes, we present a pedagogical review of a number of related {\it numerically exact} approaches to quantum many-body problems. In particular, we focus on methods based on the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix and on methods extending exact diagonalization using renormalization group ideas, i.e., Wilson's Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) and White's Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). These methods are standard tools for the investigation of a variety of interacting quantum systems, especially low-dimensional quantum lattice models. We also survey extensions to the methods to calculate properties such as dynamical quantities and behavior at finite temperature, and discuss generalizations of the DMRG method to a wider variety of systems, such as classical models and quantum chemical problems. Finally, we briefly review some recent developments for obtaining a more general formulation of the DMRG in the context of matrix product states as well as recent progress in calculating the time evolution of quantum systems using the DMRG and the relationship of the foundations of the method with quantum information theory.

The stable and quantum chaos regimes in the quantum computer hardware are identified as a function of magnetic field gradient and dipole-dipole couplings between qubits on a square lattice. It is shown that a strong magnetic field gradient leads to suppression of quantum chaos.

abstract: We report in situ measurements of density fluctuations in a quasi one dimensional Bose gas at thermal equilibrium in an elongated harmonic trap. We observe an excess of fluctuations compared to the shot noise level expected for uncorrelated atoms. At low atomic density, the measured excess is in good agreement with the expected bunching for an ideal Bose gas. At high density, the measured fluctuations are strongly reduced compared to the ideal gas case. We attribute this reduction to repulsive interatomic interactions. The data are compared with a calculation for an interacting Bose gas in the quasi-condensate regime.

abstract: A generalization of the Gibbs-von Neumann relative entropy is proposed based on the quantum BBGKY [Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon] hierarchy as the nonequilibrium entropy for an N-body system. By using a generalization of the Liouville-von Neumann equation describing the evolution of a density super- operator, it is demonstrated that the entropy production for an isolated system is non-negative, which provides an arrow of time. Moreover, following the procedure of non-equilibrium thermodynamics a master matrix is introduced for which a mi- croscopic expression is obtained. Then, the quantum Boltzmann equation is derived in terms of a transition superoperator related to that master matrix.

abstract: We consider a class of one-dimensional chains of weakly coupled many level systems. We present a theory which predicts energy diffusion within these chains for almost all initial states, if some concrete conditions on their Hamiltonians are met. By numerically solving the time dependent Schroedinger equation, we verify this prediction. Close to equilibrium we analyze this behavior in terms of heat conduction and compute the respective coefficient directly from the theory.

abstract: We investigate theoretically donor-based charge qubit operation driven by external electric fields. The basic physics of the problem is presented by considering a single electron bound to a shallow-donor pair in GaAs: This system is closely related to the homopolar molecular ion H_2^+. In the case of Si, heteropolar configurations such as PSb^+ pairs are also considered. For both homopolar and heteropolar pairs, the multivalley conduction band structure of Si leads to short-period oscillations of the tunnel-coupling strength as a function of the inter-donor relative position. However, for any fixed donor configuration, the response of the bound electron to a uniform electric field in Si is qualitatively very similar to the GaAs case, with no valley quantum interference-related effects, leading to the conclusion that electric field driven coherent manipulation of donor-based charge qubits is feasible in semiconductors.

A comb-like array of coherent atomic beams is generated by outcoupling atoms from distinct Bose-Einstein condensates confined in the independent sites of a mesoscopic optical lattice. The observed interference signal arises from the spatial beating of the overlapped atom laser beams, which is sampled over a vertical region corresponding to 2 ms of free fall time. The average relative de Broglie frequency of the atom lasers was measured.

abstract: We study statistical properties of excited levels of the E x (b_1+b_2) Jahn-Teller model. The multitude of avoided crossings of energy levels is generally claimed to be a testimony of quantum chaos. We found that apart from two limiting cases (E x e and Holstein model) the distribution of nearest-neighbor spacings is rather stable as to the change of parameters and different from the Wigner one. This limiting distribution assumably shows scaling ~$\sqrt{S}$ at small S and resembles the semi-Poisson law P(S)= 4S \exp (-2 S) at S> 1. The latter is believed to be universal and characteristic, e.g., at the transition between metal and insulator phases.

abstract: An electron inside liquid helium forms a bubble of 17 \AA in radius. In an external magnetic field, the two-level system of a spin 1/2 electron is ideal for the implementation of a qubit for quantum computing. The electron spin is well isolated from other thermal reservoirs so that the qubit should have very long coherence time. By confining a chain of single electron bubbles in a linear RF quadrupole trap, a multi-bit quantum register can be implemented. All spins in the register can be initialized to the ground state either by establishing thermal equilibrium at a temperature around 0.1 K and at a magnetic field of 1 T or by sorting the bubbles to be loaded into the trap with magnetic separation. Schemes are designed to address individual spins and to do two-qubit CNOT operations between the neighboring spins. The final readout can be carried out through a measurement similar to the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

abstract: A kicked quantum nondemolition measurement is introduced, where a qubit is weakly measured by pumping current. Measurement statistics are derived for weak measurements combined with single qubit unitary operations. These results are applied to violate a generalization of Leggett and Garg's inequality. The violation is related to the failure of the noninvasive detector assumption, and may be interpreted as either intrinsic detector backaction, or the qubit entangling the microscopic detector excitations. The results are discussed in terms of a quantum point contact kicked by a pulse generator, measuring a double quantum dot.

abstract: We consider one dimensional interacting bose-fermi mixture with equal masses of bosons and fermions, and with equal and repulsive interactions between bose-fermi and bose-bose particles. Such a system can be realized in current experiments with ultracold bose-fermi mixtures.We apply the Bethe-ansatz technique to find the exact ground state energy at zero temperature for any value of interaction strength and density ratio between bosons and fermions. We use it to prove the absence of the demixing, contrary to prediction of a mean field approximation. Combining exact solution with local density approximation (LDA) in a harmonic trap, we calculate the density profiles and frequencies of collective modes in various limits. In the strongly interacting regime, we predict the appearance of low-lying collective oscillations which correspond to the counterflow of the two species. In the strongly interacting regime we use exact wavefunction to calculate the single particle correlation functions for bosons and fermions at low temperatures under periodic boundary conditions. We derive an analytical formula, which allows to calculate correlation functions at all distances numerically for a polynomial time in the system size. We investigate numerically two strong singularities of the momentum distribution for fermions at $k_f$ and $k_f+2k_b.$ We show, that in strongly interacting regime correlation functions change dramatically as temperature changes from 0 to a small temperature $\sim E_f/\gamma.$ A strong change of the momentum distribution in a small range of temperatures can be used to perform a thermometry at very small temperatures.

abstract: Two-level electron-phonon systems with reflection symmetry linearly coupled to one or two phonon modes (exciton and E$\otimes(b_1+b_2)$ Jahn-Teller model) exhibit strong enhancement of quantum fluctuations of the phonon coordinates and momenta due to the complex interplay of quantum fluctuations and nonlinearities inherent to the models. We show that for the complex correlated quantum fluctuations of the anisotropic two-level systems the Shannon entropies of phonon coordinate and momentum and their sum yield their proper global description. On the other hand, the variance measures of the Heisenberg uncertainties suffer from several shortcomings to provide proper description of the fluctuations. Wave functions, related entropies and variances were determined by direct numerical simulations. Illustrative variational calculations were performed to demonstrate the effect on an analytically tractable exciton model.

We introduce an energy-based formalism to describe the temperature dynamics with which we study a specific and promising mixture composed of 6Li and 87Rb. Analyzing the harmonically trapped mixture, we find that the favourable features of this mixture are further enhanced by using different trapping frequencies for the two species.

abstract: A complete analysis of the decoherence properties of a Josephson junction qubit is presented. The qubit is of the flux type and consists of two large loops forming a gradiometer and one small loop, and three Josephson junctions. The contributions to relaxation (T_1) and dephasing (T_\phi) arising from two different control circuits, one coupled to the small loop and one coupled to a large loop, is computed. We use a complete, quantitative description of the inductances and capacitances of the circuit. Including two stray capacitances makes the quantum mechanical modeling of the system five dimensional. We develop a general Born-Oppenheimer approximation to reduce the effective dimensionality in the calculation to one. We explore T_1 and T_\phi along an optimal line in the space of applied fluxes; along this "S line" we see significant and rapidly varying contributions to the decoherence parameters, primarily from the circuit coupling to the large loop.

abstract: Quantum mechanics in its presently known formulation requires an external classical time for its description. A classical spacetime manifold and a classical spacetime metric are produced by classical matter fields. In the absence of such classical matter fields, quantum mechanics should be formulated without reference to a classical time. If such a new formulation exists, it follows as a consequence that standard linear quantum mechanics is a limiting case of an underlying non-linear quantum theory. A possible approach to the new formulation is through the use of noncommuting spacetime coordinates in noncommutative differential geometry. Here, the non-linear theory is described by a non-linear Schrodinger equation which belongs to the Doebner-Goldin class of equations, discovered some years ago. This mass-dependent non-linearity is significant when particle masses are comparable to Planck mass, and negligible otherwise. Such a non-linearity is in principle detectable through experimental tests of quantum mechanics for mesoscopic systems, and is a valuable empirical probe of theories of quantum gravity. We also briefly remark on the possible connection our approach could have with loop quantum gravity and string theory.

abstract: `How do our ideas about quantum mechanics affect our understanding of spacetime?' This familiar question leads to quantum gravity. The complementary question is also important: `How do our ideas about spacetime affect our understanding of quantum mechanics?' This short abstract of a talk given at the Gafka2004 conference contains a very brief summary of some of the author's papers on generalizations of quantum mechanics needed for quantum gravity. The need for generalization is motivated. The generalized quantum theory framework for such generalizations is described and illustrated for usual quantum mechanics and a number of examples to which it does not apply. These include spacetime alternatives extended over time, time-neutral quantum theory, quantum field theory in fixed background spacetime not foliable by spacelike surfaces, and systems with histories that move both forward and backward in time. A fully four-dimensional, sum-over-histories generalized quantum theory of cosmological geometries is briefly described. The usual formulation of quantum theory in terms of states evolving unitarily through spacelike surfaces is an approximation to this more general framework that is appropriate in the late universe for coarse-grained descriptions of geometry in which spacetime behaves classically. This abstract is unlikely to be clear on its own, but references are provided to the author's works where the ideas can be followed up.

We show that the Glauber model and eikonal approximation in an earlier quantum treatment are special examples of the more general path-integral method. The multiple scattering and collective flow lead essentially to an initial source at a shifted momentum, with a multiple collision absorption factor that depends on the pion absorption cross section and a phase factor that depends on the deviations of the in-medium particle momenta from their asymptotic values.

abstract: In previous papers we solved the Landau problems, indexed by 2M, for a particle on the ``superflag'' S U (2|1)/[U (1) x U (1)], the M = 0 case being equivalent to the Landau problem for a particle on the ``supersphere'' S U (2|1)/[U (1|1)]. Here we solve these models in the planar limit. For M = 0 we have a particle on the complex superplane C(1|1) ; its Hilbert space is the tensor product of that of the Landau model with the 4-state space of a ``fermionic'' Landau model. Only the lowest level is ghost-free, but for M > 0 there are no ghosts in the first [2M ]+1 levels. When 2M is an integer, the ([2M ] + 1)th level states form short supermultiplets as a consequence of a fermionic gauge invariance analogous to the ``kappa-symmetry'' of the superparticle.

abstract: We observe that the entanglement entropy resulting from tracing over a subregion of an initially pure state can grow faster than the surface area of the subregion (indeed, proportional to the volume), in contrast to examples studied previously. The pure states with this property have long-range correlations between interior and exterior modes and are constructed by purification of the desired density matrix. We show that imposing a no-gravitational collapse condition on the pure state is sufficient to exclude faster than area law entropy scaling. This observation leads to an interpretation of holography as an upper bound on the realizable entropy (entanglement or von Neumann) of a region, rather than on the dimension of its Hilbert space.

abstract: We formulate a universal characterization of the many-particle quantum entanglement in the ground state of a topologically ordered two-dimensional medium with a mass gap. We consider a disk in the plane, with a smooth boundary of length L, large compared to the correlation length. In the ground state, by tracing out all degrees of freedom in the exterior of the disk, we obtain a marginal density operator \rho for the degrees of freedom in the interior. The von Neumann entropy S(\rho) of this density operator, a measure of the entanglement of the interior and exterior variables, has the form S(\rho)= \alpha L -\gamma + ..., where the ellipsis represents terms that vanish in the limit L\to\infty. The coefficient \alpha, arising from short wavelength modes localized near the boundary, is nonuniversal and ultraviolet divergent, but -\gamma is a universal additive constant characterizing a global feature of the entanglement in the ground state. Using topological quantum field theory methods, we derive a formula for \gamma in terms of properties of the superselection sectors of the medium.

abstract: Adaptive perturbation is a new method for perturbatively computing the eigenvalues and eigenstates of quantum mechanical Hamiltonians that heretofore were not believed to be obtainable by such methods. The novel feature of adaptive perturbation theory is that it decomposes a given Hamiltonian, $H$, into an unperturbed part and a perturbation in a way which extracts the leading non-perturbative behavior of the problem exactly. This paper introduces the method in the context of the pure anharmonic oscillator and then goes on to apply it to the case of tunneling between both symmetric and asymmetric minima. It concludes with an introduction to the extension of these methods to the discussion of a quantum field theory. A more complete discussion of this issue will be given in the second paper in this series. This paper will show how to use the method of adaptive perturbation theory to non-perturbatively extract the structure of mass, wavefunction and coupling constant renormalization.

abstract: Although Casimir, or quantum vacuum, forces between distinct bodies, or self-stresses of individual bodies, have been calculated by a variety of different methods since 1948, they have always been plagued by divergences. Some of these divergences are associated with the volume, and so may be more or less unambiguously removed, while other divergences are associated with the surface. The interpretation of these has been quite controversial. Particularly mysterious is the contradiction between finite total self-energies and surface divergences in the local energy density. In this paper we clarify the role of surface divergences.

abstract: The Casimir force due to {\it thermal} fluctuations (or pseudo-Casimir force) was previously calculated for the perfect Bose gas in the slab geometry for various boundary conditions. The Casimir pressure due to {\it quantum} fluctuations in a weakly-interacting dilute Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined to a parallel plate geometry was recently calculated for Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper we calculate the Casimir energy and pressure due to quantum fluctuations in a zero-temperature homogeneous weakly-interacting dilute BEC confined to a parallel plate geometry with periodic boundary conditions and include higher-order corrections which we refer to as Bogoliubov corrections. The leading order term is identified as the Casimir energy of a massless scalar field moving with wave velocity equal to the speed of sound in the BEC. We then obtain the leading order Casimir pressure in a general three-dimensional rectangular cavity of arbitrary lengths and obtain the finite-size correction to the parallel plate scenario.

abstract: We discuss and prove an extended version of the Kerr theorem which allows one to construct exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations from a holomorphic generating function $F$ of twistor variables. The exact multiparticle Kerr-Schild solutions are obtained from generating function of the form $F=\prod_i^k F_i, $ where $F_i$ are partial generating functions for the spinning particles $ i=1...k$. Solutions have an unusual multi-sheeted structure. Twistorial structures of the i-th and j-th particles do not feel each other, forming a type of its internal space. Gravitational and electromagnetic interaction of the particles occurs via the light-like singular twistor lines. As a result, each particle turns out to be `dressed' by singular pp-strings connecting it to other particles. We argue that this solution may have a relation to quantum theory and to quantum gravity.

abstract: Energy-parity has been introduced by Kaplan and Sundrum as a protective symmetry that suppresses matter contributions to the cosmological constant [KS05]. It is shown here that this symmetry, schematically Energy --> - Energy, arises in the Hilbert space representation of the classical phase space dynamics of matter. Consistently with energy-parity and gauge symmetry, we generalize the Liouville operator and allow a varying gauge coupling, as in "varying alpha" or dilaton models. In this model, classical matter fields can dynamically turn into quantum fields (Schroedinger picture), accompanied by a gauge symmetry change -- presently, U(1) --> U(1) x U(1). The transition between classical ensemble theory and quantum field theory is governed by the varying coupling, in terms of a one-parameter deformation of either limit. These corrections introduce diffusion and dissipation, leading to decoherence.

abstract: Several mathematical views of phase-locking are developed. The classical Huyghens approach is generalized to include all harmonic and subharmonic resonances and is found to be connected to 1/f noise and prime number theory. Two types of quantum phase-locking operators are defined, one acting on the rational numbers, the other on the elements of a Galois field. In both cases we analyse in detail the phase properties and find them related respectively to the Riemann zeta function and to incomplete Gauss sums.

abstract: No quantum measurement can give full information on the state of a quantum system; hence any quantum feedback control problem is neccessarily one with partial observations, and can generally be converted into a completely observed control problem for an appropriate quantum filter as in classical stochastic control theory. Here we study the properties of controlled quantum filtering equations as classical stochastic differential equations. We then develop methods, using a combination of geometric control and classical probabilistic techniques, for global feedback stabilization of a class of quantum filters around a particular eigenstate of the measurement operator.

abstract: The local complement G*i of a simple graph G at one of its vertices i is obtained by complementing the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of i and leaving the rest of the graph unchanged. If e={i,j} is an edge of G then G*e=((G*i)*j)*i is called the edge-local complement of G along the edge e. We call two graphs edge-locally equivalent if they are related by a sequence of edge-local complementations. The main result of this paper is an algebraic description of edge-local equivalence of graphs in terms of linear fractional transformations of adjacency matrices. Applications of this result include (i) a polynomial algorithm to recognize whether two graphs are edge-locally equivalent, (ii) a formula to count the number of graphs in a class of edge-local equivalence, and (iii) a result concerning the coefficients of the interlace polynomial, where we show that these coefficients are all even for a class of graphs; this class contains, as a subset, all strongly regular graphs with parameters (n, k, a, c), where k is odd and a and c are even.

abstract: We propose a consistent quantization of the Berry-Keating Hamiltonian x p, which is currently discussed in connection with the non trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The smooth part of the Riemann counting formula of the zeros is reproduced exactly. The zeros appear, not as eigenstates, but as missing states in the spectrum, in agreement with Connes adelic approach to the Riemann hypothesis. The model is exactly solvable and renormalizable, with a cyclic Renormalization Group. These results are obtained by mapping the Berry-Keating model into the Russian doll model of superconductivity. Finally, we propose a generalization of these models in an attempt to explain the oscillatory part of the Riemann's formula.

abstract: We introduce a class of functions that limit to multifractal measures and which arise when one takes the Fourier transform of the Hadamard transform. This introduces generalizations of the Fourier transform of the well-studied and ubiquitous Thue-Morse sequence, and introduces also generalizations to other intriguing sequences. We show their relevance to quantum chaos, by displaying quantum eigenfunctions of the quantum bakers map that are approximated well by such measures, thereby extending our recent work where we pointed to the existence of ``Thue-Morse'' states.

abstract: A relative position 4-vector is constructed for two spin-zero particles. Some advantages of this relative position over Bakamjian-Thomas are pointed out. The centre-of-mass (CM) and relative positions and momenta are an explicit realisation of the so-called non-canonical covariant representation. The Hamiltonian including potential terms is factorised into CM and relative components, the latter is a Lorentz scalar readily evaluated in the CM rest frame when the relative position, momentum are canonical conjugates.

abstract: We describe the transverse beam distribution in particle accelerators within the controlled, stochastic dynamical scheme of the Stochastic Mechanics (SM) which produces time reversal invariant diffusion processes. This leads to a linearized theory summarized in a Shchr\"odinger--like (\Sl) equation. The space charge effects have been introduced in a recent paper~\cite{prstab} by coupling this \Sl equation with the Maxwell equations. We analyze the space charge effects to understand how the dynamics produces the actual beam distributions, and in particular we show how the stationary, self--consistent solutions are related to the (external, and space--charge) potentials both when we suppose that the external field is harmonic (\emph{constant focusing}), and when we \emph{a priori} prescribe the shape of the stationary solution. We then proceed to discuss a few new ideas~\cite{epac04} by introducing the generalized Student distributions, namely non--Gaussian, L\'evy \emph{infinitely divisible} (but not \emph{stable}) distributions. We will discuss this idea from two different standpoints: (a) first by supposing that the stationary distribution of our (Wiener powered) SM model is a Student distribution; (b) by supposing that our model is based on a (non--Gaussian) L\'evy process whose increments are Student distributed. We show that in the case (a) the longer tails of the power decay of the Student laws, and in the case (b) the discontinuities of the L\'evy--Student process can well account for the rare escape of particles from the beam core, and hence for the formation of a halo in intense beams.

abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of cold atoms subjected to {\em pairs} of closely spaced $\delta$-kicks from standing waves of light, and find behaviour quite unlike the well-studied quantum kicked rotor (QKR). Recent experiments [Jones et al, {\em Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 93}, 223002 (2004)}] identified a regime of chaotic, anomalous classical diffusion. We show that the corresponding quantum phase-space has a cellular structure, arising from a unitary matrix with oscillating band-width. The corresponding eigenstates are exponentially localized, but scale with a fractional power, $L \sim \hbar^{-0.75}$, in contrast to the QKR for which $L \sim \hbar^{-1}$. The effect of inter-cell (and intra-cell) transport is investigated by studying the spectral fluctuations with both periodic as well as `open' boundary conditions.

abstract: We show that a low finesse cavity can be efficient for detecting neutral atoms. The low finesse can be compensated for by decreasing the mode waist of the cavity. We have used a near concentric resonator with a beam waist of 12$\mu$m and a finesse of only 1100 to detect magnetically guided Rb atoms with a detection sensitivity of 0.1 atom in the mode volume. For future experiments on single atom detection and cavity QED applications, it should be very beneficial to use miniaturized optical resonator integrated on atom chips.

abstract: The interaction of a five-level atomic system involving electromagnetically induced transparency with four light fields is investigated. Two different light-atom configurations are considered, and their efficiency in generating large nonlinear cross-phase shifts compared. The dispersive properties of those schemes are analyzed in detail, and the conditions leading to group velocity matching for two of the light fields identified. An analytical treatment based on amplitude equations is used in order to obtain approximate solutions for the susceptibilities, ehich are shown to fit well with the numerical simulations of the full Bloch equations in a large parameter region.

abstract: Up to now, we have been faced with an age old fundamental dilemma posed by the mind-brain interaction problem, i.e. how is it that the mind which is subjective and immaterial, can interact with the brain which is objective and material? Analysis of recent experiments appears to indicate that quantum mechanics may have a role to play in the resolution of the mind-brain interaction problem in the form of biological entanglement and nonlocality. This analysis, when coupled with ongoing and proposed experiments, may help us to simultaneously resolve related issues such as whether mental events can initiate neural events, the transference of conscious subjective experience, the measurement problem and the binding problem.
