abstract: The theorem of Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph proves that different quantum states describe different physical realities. Their proof is based on the construction of entanglement measurement bases of two, and more than two qbits. In this note, I show that a two-qubit entanglement base is sufficient for a general proof.

abstract: Non-equilibrium quantum dynamics represents an emerging paradigm for condensed matter physics, quantum information science, and statistical mechanics. Strongly interacting Rydberg atoms offer an attractive platform to study driven-dissipative dynamics of quantum spin models with long-range order. Here, we explore the conditions under which stationary many-body entanglement persists with near-unit fidelity and high scalability. In our approach, coherent many-body dynamics is driven by Rydberg-mediated laser transitions, while atoms at the lattice boundary reduce the entropy of the many-body state. Surprisingly, the many-body entanglement is established by continuously evolving a locally dissipative Rydberg system towards the steady-state, as with optical pumping. We characterize the dynamics of multipartite entanglement in a 1D lattice by way of quantum uncertainty relations, and demonstrate the long-range behavior of the stationary entanglement with finite-size scaling, reaching "hectapartite" entanglement under experimental conditions. Our work opens a route towards dissipative preparation of many-body entanglement with unprecedented scaling behavior.

abstract: It is proved that a qubit encoded in excited states of a V-type quantum system cannot be perfectly transferred to the state of the cavity field mode using a single rectangular laser pulse. This obstacle can be overcome by using a two-stage protocol, in which the fidelity of a state-mapping operation can be increased to nearly one.

abstract: In quantum weak oblivious transfer, Alice sends Bob two bits and Bob can learn one of the bits at his choice. It was found that the security of such a protocol is bounded by $2P_{Alice}^{\ast }+P_{Bob}^{\ast }\geq 2$, where $P_{Alice}^{\ast }$ is the probability with which Alice can guess Bob's choice, and $P_{Bob}^{\ast }$ is the probability with which Bob can guess both of Alice's bits given that he learns one of the bits with certainty. Here we propose a protocol and show that as long as Alice is limited to individual measurements, then both $P_{Alice}^{\ast }$ and $P_{Bob}^{\ast }$ can be made arbitrarily close to $1/2$, so that maximal violation of the security bound can be reached. It is also shown that the security bound can still be violated for some limited collective attacks.

abstract: We re-examine d=4 hidden-variables-models for a system of two spin-$1/2$ particles in view of the concrete model of Hardy, who analyzed the criterion of entanglement without referring to inequality. The basis of our analysis is the linearity of the probability measure related to the Born probability interpretation, which excludes non-contextual hidden-variables models in $d\geq 3$. To be specific, we note the inconsistency of the non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ with the linearity of the quantum mechanical probability measure in the sense $\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes{\bf b}\cdot {\bf \sigma}|\psi\rangle+\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes{\bf b}^{\prime}\cdot {\bf \sigma}|\psi\rangle=\langle\psi|{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes ({\bf b}+{\bf b}^{\prime})\cdot {\bf \sigma}|\psi\rangle$ for non-collinear ${\bf b}$ and ${\bf b}^{\prime}$. It is then shown that Hardy's model in $d=4$ does not lead to a unique mathematical expression in the demonstration of the discrepancy of local realism (hidden-variables model) with entanglement and thus his proof is incomplete. We identify the origin of this non-uniqueness with the non-uniqueness of translating quantum mechanical expressions into expressions in hidden-variables models, which results from the failure of the above linearity of the probability measure. In contrast, if the linearity of the probability measure is strictly imposed, which is tantamount to asking that the non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ gives the CHSH inequality $|\langle B\rangle|\leq 2$ uniquely, it is shown that the hidden-variables model can describe only separable quantum mechanical states; this conclusion is in perfect agreement with the so-called Gisin's theorem which states that $|\langle B\rangle|\leq 2$ implies separable states.

abstract: We propose an implementation of a twin paradox scenario in superconducting circuits, with velocities as large as a few percent of the speed of light. Ultrafast modulation of the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field in a microwave cavity simulates a clock moving at relativistic speeds. Since our cavity has a finite length, the setup allows us to investigate the role of clock size as well as interesting quantum effects on time dilation. In particular, our theoretical results show that the time dilation increases for larger cavity lengths and is shifted due to quantum particle creation.

abstract: We make a source of entangled photons (SEP) using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a non-linear crystal and study the spatial distribution of photon pairs obtained through the down-conversion of different modes of light including higher order vortices. We observe that for the Gaussian pump, the thickness of the SPDC ring varies linearly with the radius of pump beam. However, in case of vortex carrying beams, two concentric SPDC rings are formed for beams above a critical radius. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of SPDC rings increase with increase in the order of optical vortex beams. The presence of a critical beam width for the vortices as well as the observed FWHM of the SPDC rings are supported with our numerical results.

abstract: It is currently unknown whether the laws of physics permit time travel into the past. While general relativity indicates the theoretical possibility of causality violation, it is now widely accepted that a theory of quantum gravity must play an essential role in such cases. As a striking example, the logical paradoxes usually associated with causality violation can be resolved by quantum effects. We ask whether the explicit construction of a theory that allows causality violation might in turn teach us something about quantum gravity. Taking the toy model of Deutsch as a starting point, in Part I we argue that, despite being a nonlinear modification of quantum mechanics, the model does not imply superluminal signalling and its predictions can be operationally verified by experimenters within an appropriate ontological setting. In Part II we show that the model can be directly applied to scalar quantum fields, provided the fields are sent back in time by an amount much larger than the coherence time of the wavepackets. We propose a generalisation of the model that lifts this constraint and recovers the predictions of standard quantum field theory when the size of the temporal jump is much smaller than the coherence time of the wavepackets. Finally, we discuss an extension of the model to ordinary gravitational time dilation. The resulting model generalises and extends earlier work on the topic and can be tested experimentally using current technology.

abstract: Penrose has been advocating the view that the collapse of the wave function is rooted in the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. Asserting that gravity wins, he arrived on basis of dimensional analysis at an estimate for the collapse time. This is an ad-hoc affair and here we will present an analysis revolving around the explicit role of time in gravitational wave function collapse. We present a thought experiment, in which we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical clock containing a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clocking action comes from a single strong laser pulse traveling in an optical cavity. At its center it contains a massive object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of space time into the problem. We find that a state of this massive object with a smaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger time delay. Considering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, this suffers from an ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states. We assert that this time ambiguity will affect the relative phase and that the wave function collapse will occur when this extra phase becomes of order unity. An absolute energy scale enters this equation and we recover Penrose's estimate for the collapse time when we set this equal to the rest mass of the object. This sheds light on the counterintuitive aspect of Penrose's claim that gravitational time dilation effects can play any role dealing with masses of order of micrograms: the rest mass is sufficiently large such that the tiny time differences can confuse the unitary time evolution.

abstract: A simple coined quantum walk in one dimension can be characterized by a $SU(2)$ operator with three parameters which represents the coin toss. However, different such coin toss operators lead to equivalent dynamics of the quantum walker. In this manuscript we present the unitary equivalence classes of quantum walks and show that all the nonequivalent quantum walks can be distinguished by a single parameter. Moreover, we argue that the electric quantum walks are equivalent to quantum walks with time dependent coin toss operator.

abstract: Progress in superconducting qubit experiments with greater numbers of qubits or advanced techniques such as feedback requires faster and more accurate state measurement. We have designed a multiplexed measurement system with a bandpass filter that allows fast measurement without increasing environmental damping of the qubits. We use this to demonstrate simultaneous measurement of four qubits on a single superconducting integrated circuit, the fastest of which can be measured to 99.8% accuracy in 140ns. This accuracy and speed is suitable for advanced multi-qubit experiments including surface code error correction.

abstract: Tests of Bell's theorem rule out local hidden variables theories. But any theorem is only as good as the assumptions that go into it, and one of these assumptions is that the experimenter can freely chose the detector settings. Without this assumption, one enters the realm of superdeterministic hidden variables theories and can no longer use Bell's theorem as a criterion. One can like or not like such superdeterministic hidden variables theories and their inevitable nonlocality, the real question is how one can test them. Here, we propose a possible experiment that could reveal superdeterminism.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0436
abstract: We investigate interference of optical fields by examining the probability distribution of photon detection. The usual description of interference patterns in terms of superposition of classical mean fields with definite phases is elucidated in quantum fashion. Especially, for interference of two independent mixtures of number states with Poissonian or sub-Poissonian statistics, despite lack of intrinsic phases, it is found that the joint probability has a distinct peak manifold in the multi-dimensional space of the detector outcomes, which is along the trajectory of the mean-field values as the relative phase varies on the unit circle. Then, an interference pattern should mostly appear in each shot of measurement as a point in the peak manifold with a randomly chosen relative phase. On the other hand, for super-Poissonian sources the mean-field description is likely invalidated with rather broad probability distributions.

abstract: The present status of the coupled-channel inverse-scattering method with supersymmetric transformations is reviewed. We first revisit in a pedagogical way the single-channel case, where the supersymmetric approach is shown to provide a complete solution to the inverse-scattering problem. A special emphasis is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative transformations. In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a non-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative transformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the inversion of the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then summarize and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress remaining difficulties and open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel examples to illustrate general principles while keeping mathematics as simple as possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between the equal-threshold and different-threshold problems. For equal thresholds, conservative transformations can provide non-diagonal Jost and scattering matrices. Iterations of such transformations are shown to lead to practical algorithms for inversion. A convenient technique where the mixing parameter is fitted independently of the eigenphases is developed with iterations of pairs of conjugate transformations and applied to the neutron-proton triplet S-D scattering matrix, for which exactly-solvable matrix potential models are constructed. For different thresholds, conservative transformations do not seem to be able to provide a non-trivial coupling between channels. In contrast, a single non-conservative transformation can generate coupled-channel potentials starting from the zero potential and is a promising first step towards a full solution to the coupled-channel inverse problem with threshold differences.

abstract: Operator quantum error correction provides a unified framework for the known techniques of quantum error correction such as the standard error correction model, the method of decoherence-free subspaces, and the noiseless subsystem method. We first show an example of a new quantum error correction scheme which can not be described by operation quantum error correction. Then we introduce a different notion of noiseless subsystems according to the example. Base on this notion, we present a more unified approach which incorporates operator quantum error correction as a special case. Moreover, we also give a sufficient and necessary condition of quantum error correction using this approach. We show that this approach provides more recovery operations than operator quantum error correction, which possibly leads to simpler decoding procedures.

abstract: Out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics is attracting considerable interest due to the recent advances in the control and manipulations of systems at the quantum level. Recently, an interferometric scheme for the detection of the characteristic function of the work distribution following a time-dependent process has been proposed [L. Mazzola {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 110} 230602 (2013)]. There, it was demonstrated that the work statistics of a quantum system undergoing a process can be reconstructed by effectively mapping the characteristic function of work on the state of an ancillary qubit. Here, we expand that work in two important directions. We first apply the protocol to an interesting specific physical example consisting of a superconducting qubit dispersively coupled to the field of a microwave resonator, thus enlarging the class of situations for which our scheme would be key in the task highlighted above. We then account for the interaction of the system with an additional one (which might embody an environment), and generalise the protocol accordingly.

abstract: We investigate the performance of quantum fisher information under the Unruh-Hawking effect, where one of the observers (eg, Rob) is uniformly accelerated with respect to other partners. In the context of relativistic quantum information theory, we demonstrate that quantum fisher information, as an important measure of the information content of quantum states, has a rich and subtle physical structure comparing with entanglement or Bell nonlocality. In this work, we mainly focus on the parameterized (and arbitrary) pure two-qubit states, where the weight parameter $\theta$ and phase parameter $\phi$ are naturally introduced. Intriguingly, we prove that $\mathcal{F}_\theta$ keeps unchanged for both scalar and Dirac fields. Meanwhile, we observe that $\mathcal{F}_\phi$ decreases with the increase of acceleration $r$ but remains finite in the limit of infinite acceleration. More importantly, our results show that the symmetry of $\mathcal{F}_\phi$ (with respect to $\theta=\pi/4$) has been broken by the influence of Unruh effect for both cases.

For fixed polarization phases, the correlations reduce to the Hanbury Brown-Twiss phase correlations. It is also shown that these classical correlations violate noncontextuality.

abstract: We study the generation of angular momentum carrying states for a single cold particle by breaking the symmetry of a spatial adiabatic passage process in a two-dimensional system consisting of three harmonic potential wells. By following a superposition of two eigenstates of the system, a single cold particle is completely transferred to the degenerate first excited states of the final trap, which are resonantly coupled via tunneling to the ground states of the initial and middle traps. Depending on the total time of the process, angular momentum is generated in the final trap, with values that oscillate between $\pm\hbar$. This process is discussed in terms of the asymptotic eigenstates of the individual wells and the results have been checked by simulations of the full two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation.

abstract: The study of quantum mechanical few-body systems is a century old pursuit relevant to countless subfields of physics. While the two-body problem is generally considered to be well-understood theoretically and numerically, venturing to three or more bodies brings about complications but also a host of interesting phenomena. In recent years, the cooling and trapping of atoms and molecules has shown great promise to provide a highly controllable environment to study few-body physics. However, as is true for many systems where few-body effects play an important role the few-body states are not isolated from their many-body environment. An interesting question then becomes if or (more precisely) when we should consider few-body states as effectively isolated and when we have to take the coupling to the environment into account. Using some simple, yet non-trivial, examples I will try to suggest possible approaches to this line of research.

abstract: We employ spin-dependent optical dipole forces to characterize the transverse center-of-mass (COM) motional mode of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal of hundreds of $^9$Be$^+$. By comparing the measured spin dephasing produced by the spin-dependent force with the predictions of a semiclassical dephasing model, we obtain absolute mode temperatures in excellent agreement with both the Doppler laser cooling limit and measurements obtained from a previously published technique (B. C. Sawyer et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 213003 (2012)). Furthermore, the structure of the dephasing histograms allows for discrimination between initial thermal and coherent states of motion. We also apply the techniques discussed here to measure, for the first time, the ambient heating rate of the COM mode of a 2D Coulomb crystal in a Penning trap. This measurement places an upper limit on the anomalous single-ion heating rate due to electric field noise from the trap electrode surfaces of $\frac{d\bar{n}}{dt}\sim 5$ s$^{-1}$ for our trap at a frequency of 795 kHz, where $\bar{n}$ is the mean occupation of quantized COM motion in the axial harmonic well.

abstract: A key quantity characterizing a time-periodically forced quantum system coupled to a heat bath is the energy flowing in the steady state through the system into the bath, where it is dissipated. We derive a general expression which allows one to compute this energy dissipation rate for a heat bath consisting of a large number of harmonic oscillators, and work out two analytically solvable model examples. In particular, we distinguish between genuine transitions effectuating a change of the systems's Floquet state, and pseudo-transitions preserving that state; the latter are shown to yield an important contribution to the total dissipation rate. Our results suggest possible driving-mediated heating and cooling schemes on the quantum level. They also indicate that a driven system does not necessarily occupy only a single Floquet state when being in contact with a zero-temperature bath.

abstract: We develop a strategy for calculating critical exponents for the Mott insulator-to-superfluid transition shown by the Bose-Hubbard model. Our approach is based on the field-theoretic concept of the effective potential, which provides a natural extension of the Landau theory of phase transitions to quantum critical phenomena. The coefficients of the Landau expansion of that effective potential are obtained by high-order perturbation theory. We counteract the divergency of the weak-coupling perturbation series by including the seldom considered Landau coefficient $a_6$ into our analysis. Our preliminary results indicate that the critical exponents for both the condensate density and the superfluid density, as derived from the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, deviate by less than $1\%$ from the best known estimates computed so far for the three-dimensional $XY$ universality class.

abstract: We derive an exact solution of an explicitly time-dependent multichannel model of quantum mechanical nonadiabatic transitions. Our model corresponds to the case of a single linear diabatic energy level interacting with a band of an arbitrary N states, for which the diabatic energies decay with time according to the Coulomb law. We show that the time-dependent Schroedingier equation for this system can be solved in terms of Meijer functions whose asymptotics at a large time can be compactly written in terms of elementary functions that depend on the roots of an Nth order characteristic polynomial. Our model can be considered a generalization of the Demkov-Osherov model. In comparison to the latter, our model allows one to explore the role of curvature of the band levels and diabatic avoided crossings.

abstract: We study the implications of quantum fluctuations of a dispersive medium, under steady rotation, either in or out of thermal equilibrium with its environment. A rotating object exhibits a quantum instability by dissipating its mechanical motion via spontaneous emission of photons, as well as internal heat generation. Universal relations are derived for the radiated energy and angular momentum as trace formulas involving the object's scattering matrix. We also compute the quantum noise by deriving the full statistics of the radiated photons out of thermal and/or dynamic equilibrium. The (entanglement) entropy generation is quantified, and the total entropy is shown to be always increasing. Furthermore, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation governing the stochastic angular motion resulting from the fluctuating back-reaction frictional torque. As a result, we find a quantum limit on the uncertainty of the object's angular velocity in steady rotation. Finally, we show in some detail that a rotating object drags nearby objects, making them spin parallel to its axis of rotation. A scalar toy model is introduced in the first part to simplify the technicalities and ease the conceptual complexities; a detailed discussion of quantum electrodynamics is presented in the second part.

abstract: Based on constructive interference in Sagnac waveguide loop, an e?cient scheme is proposed for selective frequency conversion and multifrequency modes W entanglement via input-output formalism. We can adjust the probability amplitudes of output photons by choosing parameter values properly. The tunable probability amplitude will lead to the generation of output photon with a selectable frequency and W photonic entanglement of di?erent frequencies modes in a wide range of parameter values. Our calculations show the present scheme is robust to the deviation of parameters and spontaneous decay.

We present the generalized centroid dynamics (GCD), which provides a basis to calculate Kubo-transformed correlation functions by means of classical averages. We define various types of approximate GCD, one of which is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). The RPMD and another approximate GCD are tested in one-dimensional harmonic system, and it is shown that the RPMD works better in the short time region.

abstract: The entanglement behavior of two classes of multi-qubit system, GHZ and GHZ like states passing through a generalized amplitude damping channel is discussed. Despite this channel causes degradation of the entangled properties and consequently their abilities to perform quantum teleportation, one can always improve the lower values of the entanglement and the fidelity of the teleportrd state by controlling on Bell measurements, analyzer angle and channel's strength. Using GHZ-like state within a generalized amplitude damping channel is much better than using the normal GHZ-state, where the decay rate of entanglement and the fidelity of the teleported states are smaller than those depicted for GHZ state.

abstract: A fundamental problem in quantum information is to explore the roles of different quantum correlations in a quantum information procedure. Recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett., 107 (2011) 080401] shows that the protocol for assisted optimal state discrimination (AOSD) may be implemented successfully without entanglement, but with another correlation, quantum dissonance. However, both the original work and the extension to discrimination of $d$ states [Phys. Rev. A, 85 (2012) 022328] have only proved that entanglement can be absent in the case with equal a \emph{priori} probabilities. By improving the protocol in [Sci. Rep., 3 (2013) 2134], we investigate this topic in a simple case to discriminate three nonorthogonal states of a qutrit, with positive real overlaps. In our procedure, the entanglement between the qutrit and an auxiliary qubit is found to be completely unnecessary. This result shows that the quantum dissonance may play as a key role in optimal state discrimination assisted by a qubit for more general cases.

abstract: We study the close connection between rational functions that approximate a given Boolean function, and quantum algorithms that compute the same function using postselection. We show that the minimal degree of the former equals (up to a factor of 2) the minimal query complexity of the latter. We give optimal (up to constant factors) quantum algorithms with postselection for the Majority function, slightly improving upon an earlier algorithm of Aaronson. Finally we show how Newman's classic theorem about low-degree rational approximation of the absolute-value function follows from these algorithms.

abstract: We show that, by treating the gravitational interaction between two mechanical resonators as a classical measurement channel, a gravitational decoherence model results that is equivalent to a model first proposed by Diosi. The resulting decoherence model implies that the classically mediated gravitational interaction between two gravitationally coupled resonators cannot create entanglement. The gravitational decoherence rate ( and the complementary heating rate) is of the order of the gravitationally induced normal mode splitting of the two resonators.

Some properties of this approximation are clarified through a model calculation of the position autocorrelation function for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. A key observation is that the Krishna-Voth correlation function has a term which behaves as the secular term in perturbation theory.

abstract: Tree size ($\rm{TS}$) is an interesting measure of complexity for multiqubit states: not only is it in principle computable, but one can obtain lower bounds for it. In this way, it has been possible to identify families of states whose complexity scales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. With the goal of progressing in the systematic study of the mathematical property of $\rm{TS}$, in this work we characterize the tree size of pure states for the case where the number of qubits is small, namely, 3 or 4. The study of three qubits does not hold great surprises, insofar as the structure of entanglement is rather simple; the maximal $\rm{TS}$ is found to be 8, reached for instance by the $|\rm{W}\rangle$ state. The study of four qubits yields several insights: in particular, the most economic description of a state is found not to be recursive. The maximal $\rm{TS}$ is found to be 16, reached for instance by a state called $|\Psi^{(4)}\rangle$ which was already discussed in the context of four-photon down-conversion experiments. We also find that the states with maximal tree size form a set of zero measure: a smoothed version of tree size over a neighborhood of a state ($\epsilon-\rm{TS}$) reduces the maximal values to 6 and 14, respectively. Finally, we introduce a notion of tree size for mixed states and discuss it for a one-parameter family of states.

abstract: According to the theory of relativity and causality, a special type of correlation beyond quantum mechanics is possible in principle under the name of {\it non-local box}. The concept has been introduced from the principle of non-locality which satisfies relativistic causality. In this paper, we show that a correlation leading to the non-local box is possible to be derived consistently if we release the one of major axioms in quantum mechanics, {\it Born's rule}. This allows us to obtain a theory which in one end of the spectrum agrees with the classical probability and in the other end, agrees with the theory of non-local causality. At the same time, we argue that the correlation lies in a space with special mathematical constraints such that a physical realization of the correlation through a probability measure is not possible in one direction of its limit and is possible in the other limit.

abstract: In the history of quantum mechanics, various types of uncertainty relationships have been introduced to accommodate different operational meanings of Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We derive an optimized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) that quantifies an amount of quantum uncertainty in the scenario of successive measurements. The EUR characterizes the limitation in the measurability of two different quantities of a quantum state when they are measured through successive measurements. We find that the bound quantifies the information between the two measurements and imposes a condition that is consistent with the recently-derived error-disturbance relationship.

Finally, we experimentally demonstrate these composite sequences using $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions trapped in a surface-electrode ion trap.

abstract: A universal definition of non-Markovianity for open systems dynamics is proposed. It is extended from the classical definition to the quantum realm by showing that a `transition' from the Markov to the non-Markov regime occurs when the correlations between the system and the environment, generated by their joint evolution, can no longer be neglected. The suggested definition is based on the comparison between measured correlation functions and those built by assuming that the system is in a Markov regime thus giving a figure of merit of the error coming from this assumption. It is shown that the knowledge of the dynamical map and initial condition of the system is not enough to fully characterise the non-Markovian dynamics of the reduced system. The example of three exactly solvable models, i.e. decoherence and spontaneous emission of the qubit in a bosonic bath and decoherence of the photon's polarization induced by interaction with its spacial degrees of freedom, reveals that previously proposed Markovianity criteria and measures which are based on dynamical map analysis fail to recognise non-Markov behaviour.

abstract: A shortcut to adiabaticity is a driving protocol that reproduces in a short time the same final state that would result from an adiabatic, infinitely slow process. A powerful technique to engineer such shortcuts relies on the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic fields. Determining the explicit form of the required fields has generally proven to be complicated. We present explicit counterdiabatic driving protocols for scale-invariant dynamical processes, which describe for instance expansion and transport. To this end, we use the formalism of generating functions, and unify previous approaches independently developed in classical and quantum studies. The resulting framework is applied to the design of shortcuts to adiabaticity for a large class of classical and quantum, single-particle, non-linear, and many-body systems.

abstract: We examine the hypothesis that consciousness can be understood as a state of matter, "perceptronium", with distinctive information processing abilities. We explore five basic principles that may distinguish conscious matter from other physical systems such as solids, liquids and gases: the information, integration, independence, dynamics and utility principles. If such principles can identify conscious entities, then they can help solve the quantum factorization problem: why do conscious observers like us perceive the particular Hilbert space factorization corresponding to classical space (rather than Fourier space, say), and more generally, why do we perceive the world around us as a dynamic hierarchy of objects that are strongly integrated and relatively independent? Tensor factorization of matrices is found to play a central role, and our technical results include a theorem about Hamiltonian separability (defined using Hilbert-Schmidt superoperators) being maximized in the energy eigenbasis. Our approach generalizes Giulio Tononi's integrated information framework for neural-network-based consciousness to arbitrary quantum systems, and we find interesting links to error-correcting codes, condensed matter criticality, and the Quantum Darwinism program, as well as an interesting connection between the emergence of consciousness and the emergence of time.

By exploiting continuous-time quantum-walks, we are able to avoid a mere diffusion over all possible configurations and to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the visited space. Within this restricted space, the graph isomorphism problem can be translated into the search of a satisfying assignment to a 2-SAT formula without resorting to perturbation gadgets or projective techniques. We present an analysis of the execution time of the algorithm on small instances of the graph isomorphism problem and discuss the issue of an implementation of the proposed adiabatic scheme on current quantum computing hardware.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrated that the stability of an atomic clock improves at fastest rate $\tau^{-1}$ (where $\tau$ is the averaging time) when the phase of a local oscillator is genuinely compared to the continuous phase of many atoms in a single trap (atomic phase lock). For this demonstration, we developed a simple method that repeatedly monitors the atomic phase while retaining its coherence by observing only a portion of the whole ion cloud. Using this new method, we measured the continuous phase over 3 measurement cycles, and thereby improved the stability scaling from $\tau^{-1/2}$ to $\tau^{-1}$ during the 3 measurement cycles. %Compared with the standard method that initialize phase during each measurement cycle, the long term stability was improved by a factor of $\sqrt{n_{cp}}$ (where $n_{cp}$ is the number of continuous phase measurements). This simple method provides a path by which atomic clocks can approach a quantum projection noise limit, even when the measurement noise is dominated by the technical noise.

abstract: Nonlocal correlations obtained from entangled quantum states are useful for device independent (DI) randomness certification [Nature (London) 464, 1021 (2010)]. The advantage of this DI protocol over the conventional quantum protocol is that even with untrusted experimental apparatus randomness can be certified. Although quantum entanglement is the necessary physical source for nonlocal correlation, these two are different concepts. There exist entangled states which produce no nonlocal correlation and hence are not useful for the DI randomness certification task. In this work we introduce measurement-device-independent randomness certification task and show that entangled states, having local description, can be useful resource in such task which otherwise are useless in corresponding DI scenario.

abstract: We propose a simple method to generate quantum entanglement between two macroscopic mechanical resonators in a two-cavity optomechanical system. This entanglement is induced by the radiation pressure of a single photon hopping between the two cavities. Our results are analytical, so that the entangled states are explicitly shown. Up to local operations, these states are two-mode three-component states, and hence the degree of entanglement can be well quantified by the concurrence. By analyzing the system parameters, we find that, to achieve a maximum average entanglement, the system should work in the single-photon strong-coupling regime and the deep-resolved-sideband regime.

abstract: Maximally entangled states--a resource for quantum information processing--can only be shared through noiseless quantum channels, whereas in practice channels are noisy. Here we ask: Given a noisy quantum channel, what is the maximum attainable purity (measured by singlet fraction) of shared entanglement for single channel use and local trace preserving operations? We find an exact formula of the maximum singlet fraction attainable for a qubit channel and give an explicit protocol to achieve the optimal value. The protocol distinguishes between unital and nonunital channels and requires no local post-processing. In particular, the optimal singlet fraction is achieved by transmitting part of an appropriate pure entangled state, which is maximally entangled if and only if the channel is unital. A linear function of the optimal singlet fraction is also shown to be an upper bound on the distillable entanglement of the mixed state dual to the channel.

abstract: Contrary to the conventional wisdom that deviations from standard thermodynamics originate from the strong coupling to the bath, it is shown that these deviations are intimately linked to the power spectrum of the thermal bath. Specifically, it is shown that the lower bound of the dispersion of the total energy of the system, imposed by the uncertainty principle, is dominated by the bath power spectrum and therefore, quantum mechanics inhibits the system thermal-equilibrium-state from being described by the canonical Boltzmann's distribution. This is in sharp contrast to the classical case, for which the thermal equilibrium distribution of a system interacting via central forces with pairwise-self-interacting environment, irrespective of the interaction strength, is shown to be \emph{exactly} characterized by the canonical Boltzmann distribution. As a consequence of this analysis, we define an \emph{effective coupling} to the environment that depends on all energy scales in the system and reservoir interaction. Sample computations in regimes predicted by this effective coupling are demonstrated. For example, for the case of strong effective coupling, deviations from standard thermodynamics are present and, for the case of weak effective coupling, quantum features such as stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures.

abstract: The elementary quadratic plus inverse sextic interaction containing a strongly singular repulsive core in the origin is made regular by a complex shift of coordinate $x = s-{\rm i}\varepsilon$. The shift $\varepsilon>0$ is fixed while the value of $s$ is kept real and potentially observable, $s \in (-\infty,\infty)$. The low-lying energies of bound states are found in closed form for the large couplings $g$. Within the asymptotically vanishing ${\cal O}(g^{-1/4})$ error bars these energies are real so that the time-evolution of the system may be expected unitary in an {\em ad hoc} physical Hilbert space.

abstract: The semi-classical theory of radiation-matter coupling misses local-field effects that may alter the pulse time-ordering and cascading that leads to the generation of new signals. These are then introduced macroscopically by solving Maxwell's equations. This procedure is convenient and intuitive but ad hoc. We show that both effects emerge naturally by including coupling to quantum modes of the radiation field in the vacuum state to second order. This approach is systematic and suggests a more general class of corrections that only arise in a QED framework. In the semi-classical theory, which only includes classical field modes, the susceptibility of a collection of $N$ non-interacting molecules is additive and scales as $N$. Second-order coupling to a vacuum mode generates an effective retarded interaction that leads to cascading and local field effects both of which scale as $N^2$.

abstract: A powerful tool for studying geometrical problems in Hilbert space is developed. In particular, we study the quantum pure state tomography problem in finite dimensions from the point of view of dynamical systems and bifurcations theory. First, we introduce a generalization of the Hellinger metric for probability distributions which allows us to find a geometrical interpretation of the quantum state tomography problem. Thereafter, we prove that every solution to the state tomography problem is an attractive fixed point of the so-called physical imposition operator. Additionally, we demonstrate that multiple states corresponding to the same experimental data are associated to bifurcations of this operator. Such a kind of bifurcations only occurs when informationally incomplete set of observables are considered. Finally, we prove that the physical imposition operator has a non-contractive Lipschitz constant 2 for the Bures metric. This value of the Lipschitz constant manifests the existence of the quantum tomography problem for pure states.

abstract: We study the interaction of two photons in a Rydberg atomic ensemble under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency, combining a semi-classical approach for pulse propagation and a complete quantum treatment for quantum state evolution. We find that the blockade regime is not suitable for implementing photon-photon cross-phase modulation due to pulse absorption and dispersion. However, approximately ideal cross-phase modulation can be realized based on relatively weak interactions, with counter-propagating and transversely separated pulses.

abstract: Quantum approaches relying on entangled photons have been recently proposed to increase the efficiency of optical measurements. We demonstrate here that, surprisingly, the use of classical light with entangled degrees of freedom can also bring outstanding advantages over conventional measurements in polarization metrology. Specifically, we show that radially polarized beams of light allow to perform real-time single-shot Mueller matrix polarimetry. Our results also indicate that quantum optical procedures requiring entanglement without nonlocality can be actually achieved in classical optics regime.

We individually address qubits with segmented optical pulses to construct multipartite entangled states in a programmable way. This approach enables both high fidelity and fast quantum gates that can be scaled to larger qubit registers for quantum computation and simulation.

abstract: Photons in optical networks can be used in multi-path interferometry and various quantum information processing and communication protocols. Large networks, however, are often not free from defects, which can appear randomly between the lattice sites and are caused either by production faults or deliberate introduction. In this work we present numerical simulations of the behaviour of a single photon injected into a regular lattice of beam-splitting components in the presence of defects that cause perfect backward reflections. We find that the photon dynamics is quickly dominated by the backscattering processes, and a small fraction of reflectors in the paths of the beam-splitting array strongly affects the percolation probability of the photon. We carefully examine such systems and show an interesting interplay between the probabilities of percolation, backscattering and temporary localization. We also discuss the sensitivity of these probabilities to lattice size, timescale, injection point, fraction of reflectors and boundary conditions.

abstract: Recently, the emergence of classical objectivity as a property of a quantum state has been explicitly derived for a small object embedded in a photonic environment in terms of a spectrum broadcast form---a specific classically correlated state, redundantly encoding information about the preferred states of the object in the environment. However, the environment was in a pure state and the fundamental problem was how generic and robust is the conclusion. Here we prove that despite of the initial environmental noise the emergence of the broadcast structure still holds, leading to the perceived objectivity of the state of the object. We also show how this leads to a quantum Darwinism-type condition, reflecting classicality of proliferated information in terms of a limit behavior of the mutual information. Quite surprisingly, we find ,,singular points'' of the decoherence, which can be used to faithfully broadcast a specific classical message through the noisy environment.

abstract: Controlled phase (CPHASE) gates can in principle be realized with trapped neutral atoms by making use of the Rydberg blockade. Achieving the ultra-high fidelities required for quantum computation with such Rydberg gates is however compromised by experimental inaccuracies in pulse amplitudes and timings, as well as by stray fields that cause fluctuations of the Rydberg levels. We report here a comparative study of analytic and numerical pulse sequences for the Rydberg CPHASE gate that specifically examines the robustness of the gate fidelity with respect to such experimental perturbations. Analytical pulse sequences of both simultaneous and stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) are found to be at best moderately robust under these perturbations. In contrast, optimal control theory is seen to allow generation of numerical pulses that are inherently robust within a predefined tolerance window. The resulting numerical pulse shapes display simple modulation patterns and their spectra contain only one additional frequency beyond the basic resonant Rydberg gate frequencies. Pulses of such low complexity should be experimentally feasible, allowing gate fidelities of order 99.90 - 99.99% to be achievable under realistic experimental conditions.

abstract: Quantum walks exhibit many unique characteristics compared to classical random walks. In the classical setting, self-avoiding random walks have been studied as a variation on the usual classical random walk. Classical self-avoiding random walks have found numerous applications, most notably in the modeling of protein folding. We consider the analogous problem in the quantum setting. We complement a quantum walk with a memory register that records where the walker has previously resided. The walker is then able to avoid returning back to previously visited sites. We parameterise the strength of the memory recording and the strength of the memory back-action on the walker's motion, and investigate their effect on the dynamics of the walk. We find that by manipulating these parameters the walk can be made to reproduce ideal quantum or classical random walk statistics, or a plethora of more elaborate diffusive phenomena. In some parameter regimes we observe a close correspondence between classical self-avoiding random walks and the quantum self-avoiding walk.

abstract: We study the parameter estimation for excitations of Dirac fields in the expanding Robertson-Walker universe. We employ quantum metrology techniques to demonstrate the possibility for high precision estimation for the volume rate of the expanding universe. We show that the optimal precision of the estimation depends sensitively on the dimensionless mass $\tilde{m}$ and dimensionless momentum $\tilde{k}$ of the Dirac particles. The optimal precision for the ratio estimation peaks at some finite dimensionless mass $\tilde{m}$ and momentum $\tilde{k}$. We find that the precision of the estimation can be improved by choosing the probe state as an eigenvector of the hamiltonian. This occurs because the largest quantum Fisher information is obtained by performing projective measurements implemented by the projectors onto the eigenvectors of specific probe states.

abstract: We describe an efficient way for measuring the concurrence of the hyperentanglement. In this protocol, the hyperentangled state is encoded in both polarization and momentum degrees of freedom. We show that the concurrences of both polarization and momentum entanglement can be conversed into the total success probability of picking up the odd-parity state and can be measured directly. This protocol requires the weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct the quantum nondemolition measurement and does not resort to the sophisticated controlled-not gate operation. It is feasible in current experimental technology.

abstract: We investigate the relation between local unitary symmetries and entanglement invariants of multi-qubit systems. The Hilbert space of such systems can be stratified in terms of states with different types of symmetry. We review the connection between this stratification and the ring of entanglement invariants and the corresponding geometric description in terms of algebraic varieties. On a stratum of a non-trivial symmetry group the invariants of the symmetry preserving operations gives a sufficient description of entanglement. Finding these invariants is often a simpler problem than finding the invariants of the local unitary group. The conditions, as given by the Luna-Richardson theorem, for when the ring of such invariants is isomorphic to the ring of local unitary invariants on the stratum are discussed. As an example we consider symmetry groups that can be diagonalized by local unitary operations and for which the group action on each qubit is non-trivial. On the stratum of such a symmetry the entanglement can be described in terms of a canonical form and the invariants of the symmetry preserving operations. This canonical form and the invariants are directly determined by the symmetry group. Further, we briefly discuss how some recently proposed entanglement classification schemes capture symmetry properties.

abstract: We present several quantum algorithms for performing nearest-neighbor learning. At the core of our algorithms are fast and coherent quantum methods for computing distance metrics such as the inner product and Euclidean distance. We prove upper bounds on the number of queries to the input data required to compute these metrics. In the worst case, our quantum algorithms lead to polynomial reductions in query complexity relative to the corresponding classical algorithm. In certain cases, we show exponential or even super-exponential reductions over the classical analog. We study the performance of our quantum nearest-neighbor algorithms on several real-world binary classification tasks and find that the classification accuracy is competitive with classical methods.

abstract: The premise that consciousness has a quantum mechanical basis or correlate implies that its workings have a nonlocal component. To check whether consciousness as an entity leaves a physical trace, we propose that laboratory searches for such a trace should be for nonlocality, where probabilities do not conform to local expectations. Starting with the idea that nonlocality may be veiled as one of the ways cosmic censorship operates, we further argue that in order to preserve the ordinary objective reality described by local realism and general relativity, veiled nonlocality and cosmic censorship are indispensable operational aspects of the interactions of observers with physical systems. Nevertheless, it may be possible to indirectly detect traces of nonlocality in experiments where humans and other sentient subjects are involved

abstract: Boson-sampling is a highly simplified, but non-universal, approach to implementing optical quantum computation. It was shown by Aaronson and Arkhipov that this protocol cannot be efficiently classically simulated unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, which would be a shocking result in computational complexity theory. Based on this, numerous authors have made the claim that experimental boson-sampling would provide evidence against, or disprove, the Extended Church-Turing thesis -- that any physically realisable system can be efficiently simulated on a Turing machine. We argue against this claim on the basis that, under a general, physically realistic independent error model, boson-sampling does not implement a provably hard computational problem in the asymptotic limit of large systems.

abstract: Quantum versions of control problems are often more difficult than their classical counterparts because of the additional constraints imposed by quantum dynamics. For example, the quantum LQG and quantum H infinity optimal control problems remain open. To make further progress, new, systematic and tractable methods need to be developed. This paper gives three algorithms for designing coherent observers, i.e., quantum systems that are connected to a quantum plant and their outputs provide information about the internal state of the plant. Importantly, coherent observers avoid measurements of the plant outputs. We compare our coherent observers with a classical (measurement-based) observer by way of an example involving an optical cavity with thermal and vacuum noises as inputs.

abstract: We propose a time-delayed feedback control scheme for open quantum systems that can dramatically reduce the time to reach steady state. No measurement is performed in the feedback loop, and we suggest a simple all-optical implementation for a cavity QED system. We demonstrate the potential of the scheme by applying it to a driven and dissipative Dicke model, as recently realized in a quantum gas experiment. The time to reach steady state can then reduced by two orders of magnitude for parameters taken from experiment, making previously inaccessible long time attractors reachable within typical experimental run times. The scheme also offers the possibility of slowing down the dynamics, as well as qualitatively changing the phase diagram of the corresponding physical system.

abstract: The Clauser-Horne-Shimony and Holt inequality applies when measurements with binary outcomes are performed on physical systems under the assumption of local realism. Testing such inequalities in the quantum realm usually involves either measurements of two--valued quantum observables or pre-defining a context dependent binning procedure. Here we establish the conditions to test the Clauser-Horne-Shimony and Holt inequality using any quantum observable. Our result applies to observables with an arbitrary spectrum and no prior knowledge of their underlying Hilbert space's dimension is required. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed general measurement strategy, that can be seen as positive operator valued measurements performed on the system, using the formalism of modular variables applied to the transverse degrees of freedom of single photons.

abstract: A Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a double-well potential, where atoms are incoupled to one side and extracted from the other, can in the mean-field limit be described by the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric external potential. If the strength of the in- and outcoupling is increased two $\mathcal{PT}$ broken states bifurcate from the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric ground state. At this bifurcation point a stability change of the ground state is expected. However, it is observed that this stability change does not occur exactly at the bifurcation but at a slightly different strength of the in-/outcoupling effect. We investigate a Bose-Einstein condensate in a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric double-$\delta$ potential and calculate the stationary states. The ground state's stability is analysed by means of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and it is shown that the difference in the strength of the in-/outcoupling between the bifurcation and the stability change can be completely explained by the norm-dependency of the nonlinear term in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

abstract: Displaced single-photon entanglement is a simple form of optical entanglement, obtained by sending a photon on a beamsplitter and subsequently applying a displacement operation. We show that it can generate, through a momentum transfer in the pulsed regime, an optomechanical entangled state involving macroscopically distinct mechanical components, even if the optomechanical system operates in the single-photon weak coupling regime. We discuss the experimental feasibility of this approach and show that it might open up a way for testing unconventional decoherence models.

abstract: Classical physics and quantum physics suggest two meta-physical types of reality: the classical notion of a objectively definite reality with properties "all the way down," and the quantum notion of an objectively indefinite type of reality. The problem of interpreting quantum mechanics (QM) is essentially the problem of making sense out of an objectively indefinite reality. These two types of reality can be respectively associated with the two mathematical concepts of subsets and quotient sets (or partitions) which are category-theoretically dual to one another and which are developed in two mathematical logics, the usual Boolean logic of subsets and the more recent logic of partitions. Our sense-making strategy is "follow the math" by showing how the logic and mathematics of set partitions can be transported in a natural way to Hilbert spaces where it yields the mathematical machinery of QM--which shows that the mathematical framework of QM is a type of logical system over the complex numbers. And then we show how the machinery of QM can be transported the other way down to the set-like vector spaces over Z_2 showing how the classical logical finite probability calculus (in a "non-commutative" version) is a type of "quantum mechanics" over Z_2, i.e., over sets. In this way, we try to make sense out of objective indefiniteness and thus to interpret quantum mechanics.

abstract: The genuine multiparticle negativity is a measure of genuine multiparticle entanglement which can be computed numerically. We present several results how this entanglement measure can be characterized analytically. First, we show that with an appropriate normalization this measure can be seen as coming from a mixed convex roof construction. Based on this, we determine its value for $n$-qubit GHZ-diagonal states and four-qubit cluster-diagonal states.

abstract: We propose a method for computing n-time correlation functions of arbitrary spinorial, fermionic, and bosonic operators, consisting of an efficient quantum algorithm that encodes these correlations in an initially added ancillary qubit for probe and control tasks. For spinorial and fermionic systems, the reconstruction of arbitrary n-time correlation functions requires the measurement of two ancilla observables, while for bosonic variables time derivatives of the same observables are needed. Finally, we provide examples applicable to different quantum platforms in the frame of the linear response theory.

abstract: Implementing the group arithmetic is a cost-critical task when designing quantum circuits for Shor's algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem. We introduce a tool for the automatic generation of addition circuits for ordinary binary elliptic curves, a prominent platform group for digital signatures. Our Python software generates circuit descriptions that, without increasing the number of qubits or T-depth, involve less than 39% of the number of T-gates in the best previous construction. The software also optimizes the (CNOT) depth for GF(2)-linear operations by means of suitable graph colorings.

abstract: Topological quantum error correction codes are known to be able to tolerate arbitrary local errors given sufficient qubits. This includes correlated errors involving many local qubits. In this work, we quantify this level of tolerance, numerically studying the effects of many-qubit errors on the performance of the surface code. We find that if increasingly large area errors are at least moderately exponentially suppressed, arbitrarily reliable quantum computation can still be achieved with practical overhead. We furthermore quantify the effect of non-local two-qubit correlated errors, which would be expected in arrays of qubits coupled by a polynomially decaying interaction, and when using many-qubit coupling devices. We surprisingly find that the surface code is very robust to this class of errors, despite a provable lack of a threshold error rate when such errors are present.

abstract: We present an efficient way for measuring the entanglement of the atoms. Through the auxiliary single photons input-output process in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), the concurrence of the atomic entanglement can be obtained according to the success probability of picking up the singlet states of the atoms. This protocol has three advantages: First, we do not require the sophisticated controlled-not (CNOT) gates. Second, the distributed atoms are not required to intact with each other. Third, the atomic entanglement can be distributed nonlocally, which provides its important applications in distributed quantum computation.

abstract: In this work we look at the quantum dynamics of the process known as either transport without transit (TWT), or coherent transfer of atomic population (CTAP), of a Bose-Einstein condensate from one well of a lattice potential to another, non-adjacent well, without macroscopic occupation of the well between the two. This process has previously been analysed and in this work we extend those analyses by considering the effects of quantum statistics on the dynamics and entanglement properties of the condensate modes in the two relevant wells. In order to do this, we go beyond the mean-field analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii type approach and utilise the phase-space stochastic methods so well known in quantum optics. In particular, we use the exact positive-P representation where it is suitable, and the approximate truncated WIgner representation otherwise. We find strong agreement between the results of these two methods, with the mean-field dynamics not depending on the initial quantum states of the trapped condensate. We find that the entanglement properties do depend strongly on the initial quantum states, with quantitatively different results found for coherent and Fock states. Comparison of the two methods gives us confidence that the truncated Wigner representation delivers accurate results for this system and is thus a useful method as the collisional nonlinearity increases and the positive-P results fail to converge.

abstract: Negative probabilities have long been discussed in connection with the foundations of quantum mechanics. We have recently shown that, if signed measures are allowed on the hidden variables, the class of probability models which can be captured by local hidden-variable models are exactly the no-signalling models. However, the question remains of how negative probabilities are to be interpreted. In this paper, we present an operational interpretation of negative probabilities as arising from standard probabilities on signed events. This leads, by virtue of our previous result, to a systematic scheme for simulating arbitrary no-signalling models.

The bias of the raw data can be substantially reduced compared with the previous realizations. The raw random bit rate of our generator can reach 109 Mbps. We develop a model for the generator and evaluate the min-entropy of the raw data. Toeplitz matrix hashing is applied for randomness extraction, after which the final random bits are able to pass the standard randomness tests.

abstract: For a double quantum dot (DQD) system, here we propose alternative ultrafast manipulate approach: Lyapunov control method, to transfer the state from R to L on the picosecond scale, orders of magnitude faster and transfer probability higher than the previously measured electrically controlled charge- or spin-based quits. The control laws are composed of two-direction components, one is used to eliminate the dissipation in the system, another is used to transfer the state. The control theory's stability ensures the system can be transferred to the target state in high probability, and the coefficients in control laws leads very fast convergence. The role of eliminating the dissipation plays the suppression of decoherence effect. Numerical simulation results show that under the realistic implementation conditions, the transfer probability and fidelity can be increased up to 98.79% and 98.97%, respectively. This is the first result directly applicable to a DQD system's state transferring using the Lyapunov control method. We also give specific experimental realization scheme.

abstract: In this paper, we provide a characterization of multipartite entanglement in terms of equivalence classes of states under local unitary transformation (LU) by demonstrating a simple method to construct all homogenous polynomials that are invariant under local unitary group(LUIPs) for any fixed degree. We give an upper bound on the degree of the LUIP such that the ring of LUIPs can be generated by LUIPs with degree lower than the bound. Our characterization can directly generate an algorithm whose output is a generating set of LUIPs. By employing the concept of LUIPs, we prove that multipartite entanglement is additive in the sense that two multipartite states are LU equivalent if and only if $n$-copies of these two states are LU equivalent for some $n$. The method for studying LU equivalence is also used to classify the different types of multipartite mixed entanglement according to equivalence classes of states under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC), where the pure states case was previously studied by Gour and Wallach using another approach.

abstract: We introduce a 'uniform tension-reduction' (UTR) model, which allows to represent the probabilities associated with an arbitrary measurement situation and use it to explain the emergence of quantum probabilities (the Born rule) as 'uniform' fluctuations on this measurement situation. The model exploits the geometry of simplexes to represent the states, in a way that the measurement probabilities can be derived as the 'Lebesgue measure' of suitably defined convex subregions of the simplexes. We consider a very simple and evocative physical realization of the abstract model, using a material point particle which is acted upon by elastic membranes, which by breaking and collapsing produce the different possible outcomes. This easy to visualize mechanical realization allows one to gain considerable insight into the possible hidden structure of an arbitrary measurement process. We also show that the UTR-model can be further generalized into a 'general tension-reduction' (GTR) model, describing conditions of lack of knowledge generated by 'non-uniform' fluctuations. In this ampler framework, particularly suitable to describe experiments in cognitive science, we define and motivate a notion of 'universal measurement', describing the most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement, emphasizing that the uniform fluctuations characterizing quantum measurements can also be understood as an average over all possible forms of non-uniform fluctuations which can be actualized in a measurement context. This means that the Born rule of quantum mechanics can be understood as a first order approximation of a more general non-uniform theory, thus explaining part of the great success of quantum probability in the description of different domains of reality. This is the first part of a two-part article.

abstract: In the first part of this two-part article, we have introduced and analyzed a multidimensional model, called the 'general tension-reduction' (GTR) model, able to describe general quantum-like measurements with an arbitrary number of outcomes, and we have used it as a general theoretical framework to study the most general possible condition of lack of knowledge in a measurement, so defining what we have called a 'universal measurement'. In this second part, we present the formal proof that universal measurements, which are averages over all possible forms of fluctuations, produce the same probabilities as measurements characterized by 'uniform' fluctuations on the measurement situation. Since quantum probabilities can be shown to arise from the presence of such uniform fluctuations, we have proven that they can be interpreted as the probabilities of a first-order non-classical theory, describing situations in which the experimenter lacks complete knowledge about the nature of the interaction between the measuring apparatus and the entity under investigation. This same explanation can be applied -- mutatis mutandis -- to the case of cognitive measurements, made by human subjects on conceptual entities, or in decision processes, although it is not necessarily the case that the structure of the set of states would be in this case strictly Hilbertian. We also show that universal measurements correspond to maximally 'robust' descriptions of indeterministic reproducible experiments, and since quantum measurements can also be shown to be maximally robust, this adds plausibility to their interpretation as universal measurements, and provides a further element of explanation for the great success of the quantum statistics in the description of a large class of phenomena.

abstract: We generalize the concept of mutually unbiased bases (MUB) to measurements which are not necessarily described by rank one projectors. As such, these measurements can be a useful tool to study the long standing problem of the existence of MUB. We derive their general form, and show that in a finite, $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, one can construct a complete set of $d+1$ mutually unbiased measurements. Beside of their intrinsic link to MUB, we show, that these measurements' statistics provide complete information about the state of the system. Moreover, they capture the physical essence of unbiasedness, and in particular, they satisfy non-trivial entropic uncertainty relation similar to $d+1$ MUB.

abstract: The microscopic theory of the Casimir effect in the dielectric is studied in the framework when absorption is realized via a reservoir modeled by a set of oscillators with continuously distributed frquencies with the aim to see if the effects depend on the form of interaction with the reservoir. A simple case of the one-dimensional dielectric between two metallic plates is considered. Two possible models are investigated, the direct interaction of the electromagnetic field with the reservoir and indirect interaction via an intermediate oscillator imitating the atom. It is found that with the same dielectric constant the Casimir effect is different in these two cases, which implies that in the second model it cannot be entirely expressed via the dielectric constant as in the well-known Lifshitz formula.

abstract: We investigate the parameter estimation problem in a two-qubit system, in which each qubit is independently interacting with its Markovian environment. We study in detail the sensitivity of the estimation on the decoherence rate $\gamma$ and the two-qubit interaction strength $v$. In particular, the dynamics of quantum Fisher information are employed as a measure to quantify the precision of the estimations. We find that the quantum Fisher information with respect to the decoherence rate scales like $t^2/[\exp(\gamma t)-1]$ and $\exp(-2\gamma t)$ in the unitary limit and the completely decoherent limit, respectively. When we estimate the interaction strength $v$, the quantum Fisher information shows oscillation behavior in term of time. In addition, our results provide further evidence that the entanglement of the input state may not enhance quantum metrology.

abstract: A non-relativistic quantum mechanical model for interaction of dark particles with matter is proposed; the model describes resonant amplification of effective interaction between two massive bodies at large distances between them. The phenomenon is explained by catalytic action by a third dark particle scattered at a system of two heavy bodies. It is shown that effective interaction between the heavy bodies is changed at large distances and can transform into repulsion contributing in that case to the dark energy action.

The optimal time-frequency localization ability of the continuous Morlet wavelet is found to identify the scale dependent periodic modulations efficiently, as also the emergence of neutral turbulence and dissipation, whereas the discrete Daubechies basis set has been used for detrending the temporal behavior to reveal the multi-fractality of the underlying dynamics. The scaling ex- ponents and the Hurst exponent have been estimated through wavelet based detrended fluctuation analysis,and also Fourier methods and rescale range analysis.

abstract: We consider the linear and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation for a Bose-Einstein condensate in a harmonic trap with $\cal {PT}$-symmetric double-delta function loss and gain terms. We verify that the conditions for the applicability of a recent proposition by Mityagin and Siegl on singular perturbations of harmonic oscillator type self-adjoint operators are fulfilled. In both the linear and nonlinear case we calculate numerically the shifts of the unperturbed levels with quantum numbers $n$ of up to 89 in dependence on the strength of the non-Hermiticity and compare with rigorous estimates derived by those authors. We confirm that the predicted $1/n^{1/2}$ estimate provides a valid upper bound on the the shrink rate of the numerical eigenvalues. Moreover, we find that a more recent estimate of $\log(n)/n^{3/2}$ is in excellent agreement with the numerical results. With nonlinearity the shrink rates are found to be smaller than without nonlinearity, and the rigorous estimates, derived only for the linear case, are no longer applicable.

abstract: The development of small-scale digital and analog quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and compare the computational power of classical and quantum devices, and of how to detect quantum speedup. Here we show how to define and measure quantum speedup in various scenarios, and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake quantum speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from a randomized benchmark test on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. Comparing the performance of the device on random spin glass instances with limited precision to simulated classical and quantum annealers, we find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered, and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results for one particular benchmark do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate that quantum speedup is elusive and can depend on the question posed.

abstract: Following an early work of Dwork and Stockmeyer on interactive proof systems whose verifiers are two-way probabilistic finite automata, the authors initiated in 2004 a study on the computational power of quantum interactive proof systems whose verifiers are particularly limited to quantum finite automata. As a follow-up to the authors' early journal publication [J. Comput. System Sci., vol.75, pp.255-269, 2009], we further investigate the quantum nature of interactions between provers and verifiers by studying how various restrictions on quantum interactive proof systems affect the language recognition power of the proof systems. In particular, we examine three intriguing restrictions that (i) provers always behave in a classical fashion, (ii) verifiers always reveal to provers the information on next moves, and (iii) the number of interactions between provers and verifiers is bounded.

abstract: Multipartite Quantum Correlations is one of the most relevant indicator of the quantumness of a system in many body systems. This remarkable feature is in general difficult to characterize and the known definitions are hard to measure. Besides the efforts dedicated to solve this problem, the question of which is the best approach remains open. In this work, we study the Global Quantum Discord, GQD, as a bipartite and multipartite measure. We also check the limits of this definitions and present an experimental scheme to determine the maximum of the GQD via the measurements of the system's excitations, during the time evolution of the present system.

abstract: There is a solution to the problem of asymptotic completeness in many body scattering theory that offers a specific view of the quantum unitary dynamics which allows for the straightforward introduction of local time for every, at least approximately closed, many-particle system. In this approach, Time appears as a hidden classical parameter of the unitary dynamics of a many-particle system. We show that a closed many-particle system can exhibit behavior that is characteristic for open quantum systems and there is no need for the "state collapse" or environmental influence. On the other hand, closed few-particle systems bear high quantum coherence. This local time scheme encompasses concepts including "emergent time", "relational time" as well as the "hybrid system" models with possibly induced gravitational uncertainty of time.

abstract: Cavity optomechanics offers powerful methods for controlling optical fields and mechanical motion. A number of proposals have predicted that this control can be extended considerably in devices where multiple cavity modes couple to each other via the motion of a single mechanical oscillator. Here we study the dynamical properties of such a multimode optomechanical device, in which the coupling between cavity modes results from mechanically-induced avoided crossings in the cavity's spectrum. Near the avoided crossings we find that the optical spring shows distinct features that arise from the interaction between cavity modes. Precisely at an avoided crossing, we show that the particular form of the optical spring provides a classical analog of a quantum-nondemolition measurement of the intracavity photon number. The mechanical oscillator's Brownian motion, an important source of noise in these measurements, is minimized by operating the device at cryogenic temperature (500 mK).

abstract: We discuss two approaches to producing generalized parity proofs of the Kochen-Specker theorem. Such proofs use contexts of observables whose product is $I$ or $-I$; we call them constraints. In the first approach, one starts with a fixed set of constraints and methods of linear algebra are used to produce subsets that are generalized parity proofs. Coding theory methods are used for enumeration of the proofs by size. In the second approach, one starts with the combinatorial structure of the set of constraints and one looks for ways to suitably populate this structure with observables. As well, we are able to show that many combinatorial structures can not produce parity proofs.

abstract: We present two efficient schemes which can simultaneously accomplish hyperentanglement concentration and purification for two-photon four-qubit systems in an unknown partially hyperentangled mixed states. The first can correct errors in the polarization entanglement and extract maximal hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial mode with additional partial frequency entanglement. The second uses additional maximal frequency entanglement to purify and concentrate hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial mode deterministically. Both of the two schemes are only based on existing optical devices and cross-Kerr nonlinearities.

abstract: We study a hybrid quantum system consisting of spin ensembles and superconducting flux qubits, where each spin ensemble is realized using the nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond crystal and the nearest-neighbor spin ensembles are effectively coupled via a flux qubit.We show that the coupling strengths between flux qubits and spin ensembles can reach the strong and even ultrastrong coupling regimes by either engineering the hybrid structure in advance or tuning the excitation frequencies of spin ensembles via external magnetic fields. When extending the hybrid structure to an array with equal coupling strengths, we find that in the strong-coupling regime, the hybrid array is reduced to a tight-binding model of a one-dimensional bosonic lattice. In the ultrastrong-coupling regime, it exhibits quasiparticle excitations separated from the ground state by an energy gap. Moreover, these quasiparticle excitations and the ground state are stable under a certain condition that is tunable via the external magnetic field. This may provide an experimentally accessible method to probe the instability of the system.

abstract: Motivated by the physical relevance of a spectral singularity of interacting many-particle system, we explore the dynamics of two bosons as well as fermions in one-dimensional system with imaginary delta interaction strength. Based on the exact solution, it shows that the two-particle collision leads to amplitude-reduction of the wave function. For fermion pair, the amplitude-reduction depends on the spin configuration of two particles. In both cases, the residual amplitude can vanish when the relative group velocity of two single-particle Gaussian wave packets with equal width reaches the magnitude of the interaction strength, exhibiting complete particle-pair annihilation at the spectral singularity.

abstract: Taking into account the density matrices with non-full ranks, we show that the fidelity susceptibility is determined by the support of the density matrix. Combining with the corresponding expression of the quantum Fisher information, we rigorously prove that the fidelity susceptibility is proportional to the quantum Fisher information. As this proof can be naturally extended to the full rank case, this proportional relation is generally established for density matrices with arbitrary ranks. Furthermore, we give an analytical expression of the quantum Fisher information matrix, and show that the quantum Fisher information matrix can also be represented in the density matrix's support.

abstract: We study transitions of a particle between two wells, separated by a reservoir, under the condition that the particle is not detected in the reservoir. Conventional quantum trajectory theory predicts that such no-result continuous measurement would not affect these transitions. We demonstrate that it holds only for Markovian reservoirs (infinite bandwidth $\Lambda$). In the case of finite $\Lambda$, the probability of the particle's interwell transition is a function of the ratio $\Lambda/\nu$, where $\nu$ is the frequency of measurements. This scaling tells us that in the limit $\nu\to\infty$, the measurement freezes the initial state (the quantum Zeno effect), whereas for $\Lambda\to\infty$ it does not affect the particle's transition across the reservoir. The scaling is proved analytically by deriving a simple formula, which displays two regimes, with the Zeno effect and without the Zeno effect. It also supports a simple explanation of the Zeno effect entirely in terms of the energy-time uncertainty relation, with no explicit use of the projection postulate. Experimental tests of our predictions are discussed.

abstract: In order to determine if a given PPT state is separable or not, we have to search for product vectors in the ranges of the states and their partial transposes by the range criterion. This is equivalent to solving systems of algebraic equations in terms of complex variables and their conjugates. The purpose of this note is to examine systematically these equations to get sufficient conditions for the existence of required product vectors. We will focus on the multi-partite cases which are much more delicate than the bi-partite cases. We use the notion of permanents of matrices as well as techniques from algebraic geometry through the discussion.

abstract: Quantum computers attract much attention as they promise to outperform their classical counterparts in solving certain type of problems. One of them with practical applications in quantum chemistry is simulation of complex quantum systems. An essential ingredient of efficient quantum simulation algorithms are initial guesses of the exact wave functions with high enough fidelity. As was proposed in [Aspuru-Guzik et al., Science 309, 1704 (2005)], the exact ground states can in principle be prepared by the adiabatic state preparation method. Here, we apply this approach to preparation of the lowest lying multireference singlet electronic state of methylene and numerically investigate preparation of this state at different molecular geometries. We then propose modifications that lead to speeding up the preparation process. Finally, we decompose the minimal adiabatic state preparation employing the direct mapping in terms of two-qubit interactions.

abstract: The realization of an all-optical transistor where one 'gate' photon controls a 'source' light beam, is a long-standing goal in optics. By stopping a light pulse in an atomic ensemble contained inside an optical resonator, we realize a device in which one stored gate photon controls the resonator transmission of subsequently applied source photons. A weak gate pulse induces bimodal transmission distribution, corresponding to zero and one gate photons. One stored gate photon produces fivefold source attenuation, and can be retrieved from the atomic ensemble after switching more than one source photon. Without retrieval, one stored gate photon can switch several hundred source photons. With improved storage and retrieval efficiency, our work may enable various new applications, including photonic quantum gates, and deterministic multiphoton entanglement.

Two examples are presented. In the first, we illustrate how to realize the Hadamard gate in a single-qubit system, while in the second, the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is implemented in two-qubit systems with the Ising and Heisenberg interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the control can drive the time-evolution operator into the local equivalence class of the CNOT gate and the operator keeps in this class forever with the existence of Ising coupling.

abstract: We prove exactly that the squared entanglement of formation, which quantifies the bipartite entanglement, obeys a general monogamy inequality in an arbitrary multiqubit mixed state. Based on this kind of exotic monogamy relation, we are able to construct two sets of useful entanglement indicator: the first one can detect all genuine multiqubit entangled states even in the case of the two-qubit concurrence and $n$-tangles being zero, while the second one can be calculated via quantum discord and applied to multipartite entanglement dynamics. Moreover, we give a computable and nontrivial lower bound for multiqubit entanglement of formation.

abstract: We identify a class of quantum states, each consisting of a microscopic and a macroscopic section, that are effectively decoherence-free when each particle is locally passed through a quantum channel. In particular, and in contrast to other macroscopic quantum states like the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, the content of entanglement and other quantum correlations in the microscopic to macroscopic partition of this class of states is independent of the number of particles in their macroscopic sectors, when all the particles suffer passage through local amplitude and phase damping channels. Decay of quantum correlations -- entanglement as well as quantum discord -- of this class of states in the microscopic to macroscopic partition is also much lower in the case of all the local quantum channels, as compared to the other macroscopic superposition states. The macroscopic sections of the states are formed, in each case, by using a Dicke state and an orthogonal product state, which are macroscopically distinct in terms of markedly different amounts of violation of Bell inequality.

abstract: We demonstrate the control of entanglement of a single photon between several spatial modes propagating through a strongly scattering medium. Measurement of the scattering matrix allows the wavefront of the photon to be shaped to compensate the distortions induced by multiple scattering events. The photon can thus be directed coherently to a single or multi-mode output. Using this approach we show how entanglement across different modes can be manipulated despite the enormous wavefront disturbance caused by the scattering medium.

abstract: We investigate the time evolution of the chirality reduced density matrix for a discrete-time quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice, which is obtained by tracing out the spatial degree of freedom. We analyze the standard case, without decoherence, and the situation where decoherence appears in the form of broken links in the lattice. By examining the trace distance for possible pairs of initial states as a function of time, we conclude that the evolution of the reduced density matrix is non-Markovian, in the sense defined in [H. P. Breuer, E. M. Laine, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)]. As the level of noise increases, the dynamics approaches a Markovian process. The highest non-Markovianity corresponds to the case without decoherence. The reduced density matrix tends always to a well-defined limit that we calculate, but only in the decoherence-free case this limit is non-trivial.

abstract: The dynamics of a dimer coupled to two different environments each in a spin star configuration under the influence of decoherence is studied. The exact analytical expression for the transition probability in the dimer system is obtained for different situations, i.e., independent and correlated environments. In all cases considered, it is shown that there exist well-defined ranges of parameters for which decoherent interaction with the environment assists energy transfer in the dimer system. In particular, we find that correlated environments can assist energy transfer more efficiently than separate baths.

abstract: Open quantum walks (OQW) are formulated as quantum Markov chains on graphs. It is shown that OQWs are a very useful tool for the formulation of dissipative quantum computing algorithms and for dissipative quantum state preparation. In particular, single qubit gates and the CNOT-gate are implemented as OQWs on fully connected graphs. Also, dissipative quantum state preparation of arbitrary single qubit states and of all two-qubit Bell-states is demonstrated. Finally, the discrete time version of dissipative quantum computing is shown to be more efficient if formulated in the language of OQWs.

abstract: We consider dynamics of a charged particle in a finite along the $x$ direction square lattice in the presence of normal to the lattice plane magnetic field and in-plane electric field aligned with the $y$ axis. For vanishing magnetic field this dynamics would be common Bloch oscillations where the particle oscillates in the $y$ direction with amplitude inverse proportional to the electric field. We show that a non-zero magnetic field crucially modifies this dynamics. Namely, the new Bloch oscillations consist of time intervals where the particle moves with constant velocity in the $x$ direction intermitted by intervals where it is accelerated or decelerated along the lattice edges. The analysis is done in terms of the Landau-Stark states which are eigenstates of a quantum particle in a two-dimensional lattice subject to (real or synthetic) electric and magnetic fields.

abstract: Entanglement lies at the core of quantum algorithms designed to solve problems that are intractable by classical approaches. One such algorithm, quantum annealing (QA), provides a promising path to a practical quantum processor. We have built a series of scalable QA processors consisting of networks of manufactured interacting spins (qubits). Here, we use qubit tunneling spectroscopy to measure the energy eigenspectrum of two- and eight-qubit systems within one such processor, demonstrating quantum coherence in these systems. We present experimental evidence that, during a critical portion of QA, the qubits become entangled and that entanglement persists even as these systems reach equilibrium with a thermal environment. Our results provide an encouraging sign that QA is a viable technology for large-scale quantum computing.

The topological nature of the phase evolution and its restriction to fractional values are related to both the structure of the projective space of states and entanglement. For maximally entangled states of qudits with the same Hilbert space dimension, the fractional geometric phases are the only ones attainable under local SU($d$) operations, an effect that can be experimentally observed through conditional interference.

After successfully performing this EDP, we can obtain a high quality entangled mixed state. Our EDP can work for both ideal entanglement sources and current available spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources, which makes it feasible in current experimental technology. Moreover, by using the SPDC source, we can obtain a higher fidelity. This protocol can also be used to distill the multi-partite entangled systems. All the features make it practical and useful in current quantum communications.

abstract: Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the volume operator, associated with the symmetric coupling of three SU(2) angular momentum operators, can be analyzed on the basis of a discrete Schroedinger-like equation which provides a semiclassical Hamiltonian picture of the evolution of a `quantum of space', as shown by the authors in a recent paper. Emphasis is given here to the formalization in terms of a quadratic symmetry algebra and its automorphism group. This view is related to the Askey scheme, the hierarchical structure which includes all hypergeometric polynomials of one (discrete or continuous) variable. Key tool for this comparative analysis is the duality operation defined on the generators of the quadratic algebra and suitably extended to the various families of overlap functions (generalized recoupling coefficients). These families, recognized as lying at the top level of the Askey scheme, are classified and a few limiting cases are addressed.

abstract: The quantum computer is supposed to process information by applying unitary transformations to the complex amplitudes defining the state of N qubits. A useful machine needing N=1000 or more, the number of continuous parameters describing the state of a quantum computer at any given moment is much greater than the number of protons in the Universe. However, the theorists believe that the feasibility of large-scale quantum computing has been proven via the threshold theorem. Like for any theorem, the proof is based on a number of assumptions considered as axioms. However, in the physical world none of these assumptions can be fulfilled exactly. Any assumption can be only approached with some limited precision. So, the rather meaningless error-per-qubit-per-gate threshold must be supplemented by a list of the precisions with which all assumptions behind the threshold theorem should hold. Such a list still does not exist. The theory also seems to ignore the undesired free evolution of the quantum computer caused by the energy differences of quantum states entering any given superposition. Another important point is that the hypothetical quantum computer will be a system of at least a thousand of qubits plus an extremely complex and monstrously sophisticated classical apparatus. This huge and strongly nonlinear system will generally exhibit instabilities and chaotic behavior.

We consider each cavity being weakly pumped as well as a small tunneling rate between the cavities. In such conditions, the system can be studied via quantum Langevin equations and the steady state solution can be found perturbatively. In order to ensure that the approximations and methods used to study the system are suitable, the analytical results were compared to numerical simulations. We study the statistical properties of the cavity radiation fields and we show that depending on the values of the parameters of the system, it is possible to modify the spectrum of the cavities and even enhance the sub-Poissonian character of the cavity field.

An error probability bound for all binary operator choices is provided, and it is shown how probe entanglement enhances the result.

Using the master equation approach, a method for determining the photon number distribution of the scattered field is outlined. Specifically, results for the reflected field when driving the TLS with a coherent pulse are given. While the one-photon probability is enhanced compared to the incident coherent field, the system is still not a good deterministic single-photon source. Extending the system to contain two separate transmission lines, however, output fields with one-photon probabilities close to unity can be reached.

abstract: With a view to quantum foundations, we define the concepts of an empirical model (a probabilistic model describing measurements and outcomes), a hidden-variable model (an empirical model augmented by unobserved variables), and various properties of hidden-variable models, for the case of infinite measurement spaces and finite outcome spaces. Thus, our framework is general enough to include, for example, quantum experiments that involve spin measurements at arbitrary relative angles. Within this framework, we use the concept of the fiber product of measures to prove general versions of two determinization results about hidden-variable models. Specifically, we prove that: (i) every empirical model can be realized by a deterministic hidden-variable model; (ii) for every hidden-variable model satisfying locality and lambda-independence, there is a realization-equivalent hidden-variable model satisfying determinism and lambda-independence.

The question can be asked in both the classical and quantum domains. In the latter, it is fundamental to the interpretation of the quantum formalism (Bell [1964], Kochen and Specker [1967], and others). In building a suitable mathematical model of an experiment, the physical set-up will guide us on how to model the observable variables --- i.e., the measurement and outcome spaces. But, by definition, we cannot know what structure to put on the h.v. space. Nevertheless, we show that, under a measure-theoretic condition, the h.v. question can be put into a canonical form. The condition is that the $\sigma$-algebras on the measurement and outcome spaces are countably generated (i.e., the spaces are separable). An argument using a classical result on isomorphisms of measure algebras then shows that the h.v. space can always be taken to be the unit interval equipped with Lebesgue measure.

abstract: Theories including a collapse mechanism have been presented various years ago. They are based on a modification of standard quantum mechanics in which nonlinear and stochastic terms are added to the evolution equation. Their principal merits derive from the fact that they are mathematically precise schemes accounting, on the basis of a unique universal dynamical principle, both for the quantum behavior of microscopic systems as well as for the reduction associated to measurement processes and for the classical behavior of macroscopic objects. Since such theories qualify themselves not as new interpretations but as modifications of the standard theory they can be, in principle, tested against quantum mechanics. Recently, various investigations identifying possible crucial test have been discussed. In spite of the extreme difficulty to perform such tests it seems that recent technological developments allow at least to put precise limits on the parameters characterizing the modifications of the evolution equation. Here we will simply mention some of the recent investigations in this direction, while we will mainly concentrate our attention to the way in which collapse theories account for definite perceptual process. The differences between the case of reductions induced by perceptions and those related to measurement procedures by means of standard macroscopic devices will be discussed. On this basis, we suggest a precise experimental test of collapse theories involving conscious observers. We make plausible, by discussing in detail a toy model, that the modified dynamics can give rise to quite small but systematic errors in the visual perceptual process.

abstract: We consider random number conversion (RNC) through random number storage with restricted size. We clarify the relation between the performance of RNC and the size of storage in the framework of first- and second-order asymptotics, and derive their rate regions. Then, we show that the results for RNC with restricted storage recover those for conventional RNC without storage in the limit of storage size. To treat RNC via restricted storage, we introduce a new kind of probability distributions named generalized Rayleigh-normal distributions. Using the generalized Rayleigh-normal distributions, we can describe the second-order asymptotic behaviour of RNC via restricted storage in a unified manner. As an application to quantum information theory, we analyze LOCC conversion via entanglement storage with restricted size. Moreover, we derive the optimal LOCC compression rate under a constraint of conversion accuracy.

The former one of which may induce inhomogeneous exchange interactions between the neighboring spins, while the latter one modelling a spin chain with nonuniform magnetic field. In contrast with one's traditional understanding, we found that the spin impurity can be used to enhance the TQD greatly for all the bipartition schemes of the chain, while the magnetic impurity located on one spin can make the TQD between the other two spins approaching its maximum 1 for the antiferromagnetic chain.

abstract: Topological quantum states cannot be created from a product state with constant depth local unitary circuits and are in this sense more entangled than topologically trivial states. But how entangled are they? In this paper, we quantify the entanglement in one-dimensional topological states by showing that a linear depth circuit is necessary to generate them from product states. We establish such a linear lower bound for both bosonic and fermionic topological phases and use symmetric circuits for phases with symmetry. Moreover, we show that this linear lower bound can be saturated by presenting an explicit circuit generating the topological states under consideration. This result applies to quantum circuits connecting topological states in different phases as well.

abstract: The Element Distinctness problem is to decide whether each character of an input string is unique. The quantum query complexity of Element Distinctness is known to be $\Theta(N^{2/3})$; the polynomial method gives a tight lower bound for any input alphabet, while a tight adversary construction was only known for alphabets of size $\Omega(N^2)$. We construct a tight $\Omega(N^{2/3})$ adversary lower bound for Element Distinctness with minimal non-trivial alphabet size, which equals the length of the input. This result may help to improve lower bounds for other related query problems.

abstract: Bound states of massive fermions in the Aharonov-Bohm like fields have analytically been studied. The Hamiltonians with the Aharonov--Bohm like potentials are essentially singular and therefore require specification of a one-parameter self-adjoint extension. We construct self-adjoint Dirac Hamiltonians with the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) potential in 2+1 dimensions that are specified by boundary conditions at the origin. It is of interest that for some range of extension parameter the AB potential can bind relativistic charged massive fermions. The bound-state energy is determined by the AB magnetic flux and depends upon fermion spin and extension parameter; it is a periodical function of the magnetic flux. We also construct self-adjoint Hamiltonians for the so-called Aharonov-Casher (AC) problem, show that nonrelativistic neutral massive fermions can be bound by the Aharonov-Casher background, determine the range of extension parameter in which fermion bound states exist and find their energies as well as wave functions.

abstract: Quantum entanglement offers the possibility of making measurements beyond the classical limit, however some issues still need to be overcome before it can be applied in realistic lossy systems. Recent work has used the quantum Fisher information (QFI) to show that entangled coherent states (ECSs) may be useful for this purpose as they combine sub-classical phase precision capabilities with robustness (Joo et al., 2011). However, to date no effective scheme for measuring a phase in lossy systems using an ECS has been devised. Here we present a scheme that does just this. We show how one could measure a phase to a precision significantly better than that attainable by both unentangled "classical" states and highly-entangled NOON states over a wide range of different losses. This brings quantum metrology closer to being a realistic and practical technology.

abstract: Quantum mechanics allows entanglement enhanced measurements to be performed, but loss remains an obstacle in constructing realistic quantum metrology schemes. However, recent work has revealed that entangled coherent states (ECSs) have the potential to perform robust sub-classical measurements [J. Joo et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 83601 (2011)]. Up to now no read out scheme has been devised which exploits this robust nature of ECSs, but we present here an experimentally accessible method of achieving precision close to the theoretical bound, even with loss. We show substantial improvements over unentangled "classical" states and highly-entangled NOON states for a wide range of loss values, elevating quantum metrology to a realizable technology in the near future.

abstract: It is well known that heat pumps, while being all limited by the same basic thermodynamic laws, may find realization on systems as "small" and "quantum" as a three-level maser. In order to quantitatively assess how the performance of these devices scales with their size, we design generalized $N$-dimensional ideal heat pumps by merging $N-2$ elementary three-level stages. We set them to operate in the absorption chiller mode between given hot and cold baths, and study their maximum achievable cooling power and the corresponding efficiency as a function of $N$. While the efficiency at maximum power is roughly size-independent, the power itself slightly increases with the dimension, quickly saturating to a constant. Thus, interestingly, scaling up autonomous quantum heat pumps does not render a significant enhancement beyond the optimal double-stage configuration.

This model was elaborated in connection with \mu-deformed oscillators. Here, we present the necessary concepts and tools from the so-called \mu-calculus. For the high temperatures, we obtain the virial expansion of the equation of state, as well as five virial coefficients. In the regime of low temperatures, the critical temperature of condensation is inferred. We also obtain the specific heat, internal energy, and entropy for a \mu-Bose gas for both low and high temperatures. All thermodynamical functions depend on the deformation parameter \mu. The dependences of the entropy and the specific heat on the deformation parameter are visualized.

abstract: A measurement-based quantum computer could consist of a local-gapped Hamiltonian system, whose thermal states --at sufficiently low temperature-- are universal resources for the computation. Initialization of the computer would correspond to cooling the system. We perform an experimental quantum simulation of such cooling process with entangled photons. We prepare three-qubit thermal cluster states exploiting the equivalence between local dephasing and thermalisation for these states. This allows us to tune the system's temperature by changing the dephasing strength. We monitor the entanglement as the system cools down and observe the transitions from separability to bound entanglement, and then to free entanglement. We also analyze the performance of the system for measurement-based single-qubit state preparation. These studies constitute a basic characterisation of experimental cluster-state computation under imperfect conditions.

abstract: Very recently, interferometric methods have been proposed to measure the full statistics of work performed on a driven quantum system [Dorner et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 230601 (2013)] and [Mazzola et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 230602 (2013)]. The advantage of such schemes is that they replace the necessity to make projective measurements by performing phase estimation on an appropriately coupled ancilla qubit. These proposals are one possible route to the tangible experimental exploration of quantum thermodynamics, a subject which is the centre of much current attention due to the current control of mesoscopic quantum systems. In this Letter we demonstrate that a modification of the phase estimation protocols can be used in order to measure the heat distribution of a quantum process. In addition we demonstrate how our scheme may be implemented using ion trap technology. Our scheme should pave the way for the first experimental explorations of the Landauer principle and hence the intricate energy to information conversion in mesoscopic quantum systems.

abstract: We first prove that ontological models of the quantum state which are capable of reproducing the Born probability rule and fall in the class of $\psi$-epistemic models are inconsistent with the Sch{\"o}dinger time evolution. We then model the ontic state space as a complex projective Hilbert space that embeds the projective Hilbert space of quantum mechanics and define a minimalist epistemic state as an average over a set of "hidden states" in the larger space. We show that such a model incorporates probability amplitudes and admits an epistemic interpretation of quantum states. Finally, we prove a second theorem to show that such a model is compatible with locality but ontic models are not.

abstract: The process of state preparation, its transmission and subsequent measurement can be classically simulated through the communication of some amount of classical information. Recently, we proved that the minimal communication cost is the minimum of a convex functional over a space of suitable probability distributions. It is now proved that this optimization problem is the dual of a geometric programming maximization problem, which displays some appealing properties. First, the number of variables grows linearly with the input size. Second, the objective function is linear in the input parameters and the variables. Finally, the constraints do not depend on the input parameters. These properties imply that, once a feasible point is found, the computation of a lower bound on the communication cost in any two-party process is linearly complex. The studied scenario goes beyond quantum processes and includes the communication complexity scenario introduced by Yao. We illustrate the method by analytically deriving some non-trivial lower bounds. Finally, we conjecture the lower bound $n 2^n$ for a noiseless quantum channel with capacity $n$ qubits. This bound can have an interesting consequence in the context of the recent quantum-foundational debate on the reality of the quantum state.

abstract: In this article we use optimal control to maximize the efficiency of a quantum heat engine executing the Otto cycle in the presence of external noise. We optimize the engine performance for both amplitude and phase noise. In the case of phase damping we additionally show that the ideal performance of a noiseless engine can be retrieved in the adiabatic (long time) limit. The results obtained here are useful in the quest for absolute zero, the design of quantum refrigerators that can cool a physical system to the lowest possible temperature. They can also be applied to the optimal control of a collection of classical harmonic oscillators sharing the same time-dependent frequency and subjected to similar noise mechanisms. Finally, our methodology can be used for the optimization of other interesting thermodynamic processes.

abstract: We study the evolution of the most general initial Gaussian packet with nonzero correlation coefficient between the coordinate and momentum operators in the presence of a repulsive delta potential barrier, using the known exact propagator of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. For the initial packet localized far enough from the barrier, we define the transmission coefficient as the probability of discovering the particle in the whole semi-axis on the other side of the barrier. It appears that the asymptotical transmission coefficient (calculated in the large time limit) depends on two dimensionless parameters: the normalized ratio of the potential strength to the initial mean value of momentum and the ratio of the initial momentum dispersion to the initial mean value of momentum. For small values of the second parameter the result is reduced to the well known formula for the transparency of the delta barrier, obtained in the plane wave approximation by solving the stationary Schr\"odinger equation. For big values of the second parameter, the transmission coefficient can be much bigger than that calculated in the plane wave approximation. For a fixed initial spread of the packet in the coordinate space, the initial correlation coefficient influences the transparency of the barrier only indirectly, through the increase of the initial momentum dispersion.

abstract: We establish the classical capacity of optical quantum channels as a sharp transition between two regimes---one which is an error-free regime for communication rates below the capacity, and the other in which the probability of correctly decoding a classical message converges exponentially fast to zero if the communication rate exceeds the classical capacity. This result is obtained by proving a strong converse theorem for the classical capacity of all phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels, a well-established model of optical quantum communication channels, such as lossy optical fibers, amplifier and free-space communication. The theorem holds under a particular photon-number occupation constraint, which we describe in detail in the paper. Our result bolsters the understanding of the classical capacity of these channels and opens the path to applications, such as proving the security of noisy quantum storage models of cryptography with optical links.

abstract: Quantum computers promise dramatic advantages over their classical counterparts, but the answer to the most basic question "What is the source of the power in quantum computing?" has remained elusive. Here we prove a remarkable equivalence between the onset of contextuality and the possibility of universal quantum computation via magic state distillation. This is a conceptually satisfying link because contextuality provides one of the fundamental characterizations of uniquely quantum phenomena and, moreover, magic state distillation is the leading model for experimentally realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, this connection suggests a unifying paradigm for the resources of quantum information: the nonlocality of quantum theory is a particular kind of contextuality and nonlocality is already known to be a critical resource for achieving advantages with quantum communication. In addition to clarifying these fundamental issues, this work advances the resource framework for quantum computation, which has a number of practical applications, such as characterizing the efficiency and trade-offs between distinct theoretical and experimental schemes for achieving robust quantum computation and bounding the overhead cost for the classical simulation of quantum algorithms.

abstract: We address the characterization of classical fractional random noise via quantum probes. In particular, we focus on estimation and discrimination problems involving the fractal dimension of the trajectories of a system subject to fractional Brownian noise. We assume that the classical degree of freedom exposed to the environmental noise is coupled to a quantum degree of freedom of the same system, e.g. its spin, and exploit quantum limited measurements on the spin part to characterize the classical fractional noise. More generally, our approach may be applied to any two-level system subject to dephasing perturbations described by fractional Brownian noise, in order to assess the precision of quantum limited measurements in the characterization of the external noise. In order to assess the performances of quantum probes we evaluate the Bures metric, as well as the Helstrom and the Chernoff bound, and optimize their values over the interaction time. We find that quantum probes may be successfully employed to obtain a reliable characterization of fractional Gaussian process when the coupling with the environment is weak or strong. In the first case decoherence is not much detrimental and for long interaction times the probe acquires information about the environmental parameters without being too much mixed. Conversely, for strong coupling, information is quickly impinged on the quantum probe and can effectively retrieved by measurements performed in the early stage of the evolution. In the intermediate situation, none of the two above effects take place: information is flowing from the environment to the probe too slowly compared to decoherence, and no measurements can be effectively employed to extract it from the quantum probe. The two regimes of weak- and strong-coupling are defined in terms of a threshold value of the coupling, which itself increases with the fractional dimension.

abstract: The amount of intrinsic randomness that can be extracted from measurement on quantum systems depends on several factors: notably, the power given to the adversary and the level of characterization of the devices of the authorized partners. After presenting a systematic introduction to these notions, in this paper we work in the class of least adversarial power, which is relevant for assessing setups operated by trusted experimentalists, and compare three levels of characterization of the devices. Many recent studies have focused on the so-called "device-independent" level, in which a lower bound on the amount of intrinsic randomness can be certified without any characterization. The other extreme is the case when all the devices are fully characterized: this "tomographic" level has been known for a long time. We present for this case a systematic and efficient approach to quantifying the amount of intrinsic randomness, and show that setups involving ancillas (POVMs, pointer measurements) may not be interesting here, insofar as one may extract randomness from the ancilla rather than from the system under study. Finally, we study how much randomness can be obtained in presence of an intermediate level of characterization related to the task of "steering", in which Bob's device is fully characterized while Alice's is a black box. We obtain our results here by adapting the NPA hierarchy of semidefinite programs to the steering scenario.

abstract: Achieving fast populations transfer (FPT) in multiparticle systems based on the cavity quantum electronic dynamics (CQED) is an outstanding challenge. In this paper, motivated by the quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), a shortcut for performing the FPT of ground states in multiparticle systems with the invariant based inverse engineering is proposed. Numerical simulation demonstrates that a perfect populations transfer of ground states in multiparticle systems can be rapidly achieved in one step, and the FPT is robust to both the cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission. Additionally, this scheme is not only implemented without requiring extra complex conditions, but also insensitive to variations of the parameters.

abstract: The transfer matrix of a possibly complex and energy-dependent scattering potential can be identified with the $S$-matrix of a two-level time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H(t). We show that the application of the adiabatic approximation to H(t) corresponds to the semiclassical description of the original scattering problem. In particular, the geometric part of the phase of the evolving eigenvectors of H(t) gives the pre-exponential factor of the WKB wave functions. We use these observations to give an explicit semiclassical expression for the transfer matrix. This allows for a detailed study of the semiclassical unidirectional reflectionlessness and invisibility. We examine concrete realizations of the latter in the realm of optics.

abstract: Indistinguishable quantum states interfere, but the mere possibility of obtaining information that could distinguish between overlapping states inhibits quantum interference. Quantum interference imaging can outperform classical imaging or even have entirely new features. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a quantum imaging concept that relies on the indistinguishability of the possible sources of a photon that remains undetected. Our experiment uses pair creation in two separate down-conversion crystals. While the photons passing through the object are never detected, we obtain images exclusively with the sister photons that do not interact with the object. Therefore the object to be imaged can be either opaque or invisible to the detected photons. Moreover, our technique allows the probe wavelength to be chosen in a range for which suitable sources and/or detectors are unavailable. Our experiment is a prototype in quantum information where knowledge can be extracted by and about a photon that is never detected.

abstract: The nonlinearity is an important feature in the field of optomechanics. Employing atomic coherence, we put forward a scheme to enhance the nonlinearity of the cavity optomechanical system. The effective Hamiltonian is derived, which shows that the nonlinear strength can be enhanced by increasing the number of atoms at certain range of parameters. We also numerically study the nonlinearity enhancement beyond the effective Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we investigate the potential usage of the nonlinearity in performing quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the bosonic modes. Our results show that the present system exhibits synchronization, and the nonlinear effects provide us an effective method in performing QND.

abstract: In 2005, Couder, Protiere, Fort and Badouad showed that oil droplets bouncing on a vibrating tray of oil can display nonlocal interactions reminiscent of the particle-wave associations in quantum mechanics; in particular they can move, attract, repel and orbit each other. Subsequent experimental work by Couder, Fort, Protiere, Eddi, Sultan, Moukhtar, Rossi, Molacek, Bush and Sbitnev has established that bouncing drops exhibit single-slit and double-slit diffraction, tunnelling, quantised energy levels, Anderson localisation and the creation/annihilation of droplet/bubble pairs. In this paper we explain why. We show first that the surface waves guiding the droplets are Lorentz covariant with the characteristic speed c of the surface waves; second, that pairs of bouncing droplets experience an inverse-square force of attraction or repulsion according to their relative phase, and an analogue of the magnetic force; third, that bouncing droplets are governed by an analogue of Schroedinger's equation where Planck's constant is replaced by an appropriate constant of the motion; and fourth, that orbiting droplet pairs exhibit spin-half symmetry and align antisymmetrically as in the Pauli exclusion principle. Our analysis explains the similarities between bouncing-droplet experiments and the behaviour of quantum-mechanical particles. It also enables us to highlight some differences, and to predict some surprising phenomena that can be tested in feasible experiments.

abstract: In this work, we derive a generalization of the so-called Schr\"odinger-Langevin or Kostin equation for a Brownian particle interacting with a heat bath. This generalization is based on a nonlinear interaction model providing a state-dependent dissipation process exhibiting multiplicative noise. Two straightforward applications to the measurement process are then analyzed, continuous and weak measurements in terms of the quantum Bohmian trajectory formalism. Finally, it is also shown that the generalized uncertainty principle, which appears in some approaches to quantum gravity, can be expressed in terms of this generalized equation

abstract: We study several classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems, which can be expressed in terms of bilinear combinations of Euclidean Lie algebraic generators. The classes are distinguished by different versions of antilinear (PT)-symmetries exhibiting various types of qualitative behaviour. On the basis of explicitly computed non-perturbative Dyson maps we construct metric operators, isospectral Hermitian counterparts for which we solve the corresponding time-independent Schroedinger equation for specific choices of the coupling constants. In these cases general analytical expressions for the solutions are obtained in the form of Mathieu functions, which we analyze numerically to obtain the corresponding energy eigenspectra. We identify regions in the parameter space for which the corresponding spectra are entirely real and also domains where the PT symmetry is spontaneously broken and sometimes also regained at exceptional points. In some cases it is shown explicitly how the threshold region from real to complex spectra is characterized by the breakdown of the Dyson maps or the metric operator. We establish the explicit relationship to models currently under investigation in the context of beam dynamics in optical lattices.

abstract: As quantum systems become more experimentally accessible, we are forced to reconsider the notions of control and work to fully account for quantum effects. To this end, we identify the work injected into a quantum system during a general quantum-mechanical driving protocol and quantify the relevant heat flows. The known results that are applicable in the limit of a classical drive are shown to emerge from our equations as a special case. Using the established framework, we show that the Bochkov--Kuzovlev identity for the exclusive work distribution is modified in a nontrivial way by the accumulation of system--drive correlations resulting from quantum backaction. Our results accentuate the conceptual and discernible differences between a fully quantum-mechanical and classical driving protocols of quantum systems.

abstract: We ask how quantum theory compares to more general physical theories from the point of view of dimension. To do so, we first give two model independent definition of the dimension of physical systems, based on measurements and on the capacity of storing information. While both definitions are equivalent in classical and quantum mechanics, they are in general different in generalized probabilistic theories. We discuss in detail the case of a theory known as 'boxworld', and show that such a theory features systems with a dimension mismatch. This dimension mismatch can be made arbitrarily large by using an amplification procedure. Furthermore, we show that the dimension mismatch of boxworld has strong consequences on its power for performing information-theoretic tasks, leading to the collapse of communication complexity and to the violation of information causality. Finally, we discuss the consequences of a dimension mismatch from the perspective of thermodynamics, and ask whether this effect could break Landauer's erasure principle and thus the second law.

abstract: A "no-knowledge" measurement of an open quantum system yields no information about any system observable; it only returns noise input from the environment. Surprisingly, performing such a no-knowledge measurement can be advantageous. We prove that a system undergoing no-knowledge monitoring has reversible noise, which can be cancelled by directly feeding back the measurement signal. We show how no-knowledge feedback control can be used to cancel decoherence in an arbitrary quantum system coupled to a Markovian reservoir that is being monitored. Since no-knowledge feedback does not depend on the system state or Hamiltonian, such decoherence cancellation is guaranteed to be general, robust and can operate in conjunction with any other quantum control protocol. As an application, we show that no-knowledge feedback could be used to improve the performance of dissipative quantum computers subjected to local loss.

abstract: We consider the concept of "the permutationally invariant (PI) part of a density matrix," which has proven very useful for both efficient quantum state estimation and entanglement characterization of $N$-qubit systems. We show here that the concept is, in fact, basis-dependent, but that this basis dependence makes it an even more powerful concept than has been appreciated so far. By considering the PI part $\rho^{{\rm PI}}$ of a general (mixed) $N$-qubit state $\rho$, we obtain: (i) strong bounds on quantitative nonseparability measures, (ii) a whole hierarchy of multi-partite separability criteria (one of which entails a sufficient criterion for genuine $N$-partite entanglement) that can be experimentally determined by just $2N+1$ measurement settings, (iii) a definition of an efficiently measurable degree of separability, which can be used for quantifying a novel aspect of decoherence of $N$ qubits, and (iv) an explicit example that shows there are, for increasing $N$, genuinely $N$-partite entangled states lying closer and closer to the maximally mixed state. Moreover, we show that if the PI part of a state is $k$-nonseparable, then so is the actual state. We further argue to add as requirement on any multi-partite entanglement measure $E$ that it satisfy $E(\rho)\geq E(\rho^{{\rm PI}})$, even though the operation that maps $\rho\rightarrow\rho^{{\rm PI}}$ is not local.

abstract: Since its inception at the beginning of the twentieth century, quantum mechanics has challenged our conceptions of how the universe ought to work; however, the equations of quantum mechanics can be too computationally difficult to solve using existing computers for even modestly large systems. Here I will show that quantum computers can sometimes be used to address such problems and that quantum computer science can assign formal complexities to learning facts about nature. Hence, computer science should not only be regarded as an applied science; it is also of central importance to the foundations of science.

abstract: The Lorentz transformation (LT) is explained by changes occurring in the wave characteristics of matter as it changes inertial frame. This explanation is akin to that favoured by Lorentz, but informed by later insights, due primarily to de Broglie, regarding the underlying unity of matter and radiation. To show the nature of these changes, a massive particle is modelled as a standing wave in three dimensions. As the particle moves, the standing wave becomes a travelling wave having two factors. One is a carrier wave displaying the dilated frequency and contracted ellipsoidal form described by the LT, while the other (identified as the de Broglie wave) is a modulation defining the dephasing of the carrier wave (and thus the failure of simultaneity) in the direction of travel. The superluminality of the de Broglie wave is thus explained, as are several other mysterious features of the optical behaviour of matter, including the physical meaning of the Schr\"odinger Eqn. and the relevance to scattering processes of the de Broglie wave number. Consideration is given to what this Lorentzian approach to relativity might mean for the possible existence of a preferred frame and the origin of the observed Minkowski metric.

abstract: We show that dynamics in spin-orbit coupling field simulates the von Neumann measurement of a particle spin. We demonstrate how the measurement influences the spin and coordinate evolution of a particle by comparing two examples of such a procedure. First example is a simultaneous measurement of spin components, $\sigma _{x}$ and $\sigma _{y}$, corresponding to non-commuting operators, which cannot be accurately obtained together at a given time instant due to the Heisenberg uncertainty ratio. By mapping spin dynamics onto a spatial walk such a procedure determines measurement-time averages of $\sigma _{x}$ and $\sigma _{y}$, which already can be precisely evaluated in a single short-time measurement. The other, qualitatively different, example is the spin of a one-dimensional particle in a magnetic field. Here the outcome depends on the angle between the spin-orbit coupling and magnetic fields. These results can be applied to studies of spin-orbit coupled cold atoms and electrons in solids.

abstract: Here, we compare the behavior of the quantum discord, 1-norm geometric quantum discord and concurrence under the effect of decoherence for XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Their dependencies on temperature and coupling constant are presented in detail. By a comparison between them we can see that quantum discord and 1-norm geometric quantum discord are more robust than the concurrence against decoherence in the sense that quantum discord and 1-norm geometric quantum discord takes a nonzero value and decrease asymptotically, while the concurrence is zero in a large range of parameters including temperature and coupling constant. Moreover, we find that there is no simple relative ordering between 1-norm geometric quantum discord and quantum discord. This result contradicts the information which provided in some papers.

abstract: In this paper, we consider quantum correlations (quantum discord and local quantum uncertainty) in a vertical quantum dot. Their dependencies on magnetic field and temperature are presented in detail. It is noticeable that, quantum discord and local quantum uncertainty behavior is similar to a large extent. In addition, the time evolution of quantum discord and local quantum uncertainty under dephasing and amplitude damping channels is investigated. It has been found that, for some Belldiagonal states quantum discord is invariant under some decoherence in a finite time interval [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 200401 (2010)]. Also, our results show that quantum discord is invariant under dephasing channel for a finite time interval in a vertical quantum dot, while this phenomenon does not occurs for local quantum uncertainty case.

abstract: We consider the quantum correlations for a S=1/2 Ising- Heisenberg model of a symmetrical diamond chain. Firstly, we compare concurrence, quantum discord and 1- norm geometric quantum discord of an ideal diamond chain in the absence of magnetic field. The results show no simple ordering relations between these quantum correlations, so that quantum discord may be smaller or larger than the 1-norm geometric quantum discord, which this observation contradict the previous result that provided by F. M. Paula [1]. Symmetrical behavior of quantum correlation versus ferromagnetic and anti- ferromagnetic coupling constant J is considerable. The effect of external magnetic field H and temperature- dependence is also considered. Furthermore, we study quantum discord and geometric measure of quantum discord with the effect of next nearest neighbor interaction between nodal Ising sites for a generalized diamond chain, and we observe coexistence of phases with different values of magnetic field for quantum correlations. Moreover, entanglement sudden death occurs while quantum discord, 1- norm geometric quantum discord and geometric quantum discord are immune from sudden death.

abstract: The study of Gaussian states has arisen to a privileged position in continuous variable quantum information in recent years. This is due to vehemently pursued experimental realisations and a magnificently elegant mathematical framework. In this article, we provide a brief, and hopefully didactic, exposition of Gaussian state quantum information and its contemporary uses, including sometimes omitted crucial details. After introducing the subject material and outlining the essential toolbox of continuous variable systems, we define the basic notions needed to understand Gaussian states and Gaussian operations. In particular, emphasis is placed on the mathematical structure combining notions of algebra and symplectic geometry fundamental to a complete understanding of Gaussian informatics. Furthermore, we discuss the quantification of different forms of correlations (including entanglement and quantum discord) for Gaussian states, paying special attention to recently developed measures. The manuscript is concluded by succinctly expressing the main Gaussian state limitations and outlining a selection of possible future lines for quantum information processing with continuous variable systems.

abstract: We study Chiral Based Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (CBEIT) of a light pulse and its associated subluminal and superluminal behavior through a cold and a hot medium of 4-level \textit{double-Lambda type} atomic system. The dynamical behavior of this chiral based system is temperature dependent. The magnetic field based chirality and dispersion is always opposite as compared with the electric field ones. Contrastingly, the response of the chiral effect along with the incoherence Doppler broadening mechanism enhances the superluminal behavior as compared with its traditional degrading effect. Nevertheless, the intensity of a coupled microwave field destroys the coherence of the medium and degrade superluminality and subluminality of the sysmtem. The undistorted retrieved pulse from a hot chiral medium delays by $896 ns$ than from a cold chiral medium under same set of parameters. Nevertheless, it advances by $-31n s$ in the cold chiral medium when a suitably different spectroscopic parameters are selected. The corresponding group index of the medium and the time delay/advance, are studied and analyzed explicitly [Note: A revise version is under preparation

abstract: By taking the need for quantum reference frames into account, it is shown that Hilbert-space factorization is a dissipative process requiring on the order of kT to reduce by one bit an observer's uncertainty in the provenance of a classically-recorded observational outcome. This cost is neglected in standard treatments of decoherence that assume that observational outcomes are obtained by interacting with a collection of degrees of freedom identified a priori. Treating this cost explicitly leads to a natural measure of the probability of any particular quantum reference frame.

abstract: The accurate detection of small deviations in given density matrices is important for quantum information processing. Here we propose a new method based on the concept of data mining. We demonstrate that the proposed method can more accurately detect small erroneous deviations in reconstructed density matrices, which contain intrinsic fluctuations due to the limited number of samples, than a naive method of checking the trace distance from the average of the given density matrices. This method has the potential to be a key tool in broad areas of physics where the detection of small deviations of quantum states reconstructed using a limited number of samples are essential.

abstract: The main claim of the paper is that one can be 'realist' (in some sense) about quantum mechanics without requiring any form of realism about the wave function. We begin by discussing various forms of realism about the wave function, namely Albert's configuration-space realism, Duerr Zanghi and Goldstein's nomological realism about the wave function, Esfeld's dispositional reading of the wave function and Pusey Barrett and Rudolph's realism about the quantum state. By discussing the articulation of these four positions, and their interrelation, we conclude that instrumentalism about the wave function is by itself not sufficient to choose one over the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, thereby confirming in a different way the indetermination of the metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the multimode quantum state embedded in an optical frequency comb generated by a Synchronously Pumped Optical Parametric Oscillator (SPOPO). The full covariance matrix of the state is obtained with homodyne detection where the local oscillator is spectrally controlled with pulse shaping techniques. The resulting matrix reveals genuine multipartite entanglement. Additionally, the beam is comprised of several independent eigenmodes that correspond to specific pulse shapes. The experimental data is confirmed with numerical simulations. Finally, the potential to create continuous-variable cluster states from the quantum comb is analyzed. Multiple cluster states are shown to be simultaneously embedded in the SPOPO state, and these states can be revealed by a suitable basis change applied to the measured covariance matrix.

We have used the recently demonstrated technique of controlling the spatial characteristics of the down-conversion process via intermodal dispersion to generate photon pairs in fundamental transverse modes, thus ensuring their spatial indistinguishability. Good spatial overlap of photon modes within pairs has been verified using the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer and the preparation of polarization entanglement in the Shih-Alley configuration, yielding visibilities consistently above 90%.

abstract: We explore set-stabilizability by constrained controls, and both controllability and stabilizability can be regarded as the special case of set-stabilizability. We not only clarify how to define an equilibrium point of Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger Equations, but also establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizability of quantum systems. Unfortunately, it is revealed that the necessary conditions are quite strict for stabilizability of some concrete quantum systems like nuclear spin systems, and this further justifies the introduction of set-stabilizability notion. It is also exemplified that set-stabilizability can be used for investigating quantum information processing problems including quantum information storage and entangled states generation.

abstract: We consider discriminating between bipartite boxes with 2 binary inputs and 2 binary outputs (2x2) using the class of completely locality preserving operations i.e. those, which transform boxes with local hidden variable model (LHVM) into boxes with LHVM, and have this property even when tensored with identity operation. Following approach developed in entanglement theory we derive linear program which gives an upper bound on the probability of success of discrimination between different isotropic boxes. In particular we provide an upper bound on the probability of success of discrimination between isotropic boxes with the same mixing parameter. As a counterpart of entanglement monotone we use the non-locality cost. Discrimination is restricted by the fact that non-locality cost does not increase under considered class of operations. We also show that with help of allowed class of operations one can distinguish perfectly any two extremal boxes in 2x2 case and any local extremal box from any other extremal box in case of two inputs and two outputs of arbitrary cardinalities.

abstract: We propose a multilevel quantum heat engine with a working medium described by a generalized Rabi model which consists of a two-level system coupled to a single mode bosonic field. The model is constructed to be a continuum limit of a quantum biological description of light harvesting complexes so that it can amplify quantum coherence by a mechanism which is a quantum analog of classical Huygen's clocks. The engine operates in quantum Otto cycle where the working medium is coupled to classical heat baths in the isochoric processes of the four stroke cycle; while either the coupling strength or the resonance frequency is changed in the adiabatic stages. We found that such an engine can produce work with an efficiency close to Carnot bound when it operates at low temperatures and in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Interplay of quantum coherence and quantum correlations on the engine performance is discussed in terms of second order coherence, quantum mutual information and logarithmic negativity of entanglement. We point out that the proposed quantum Otto engine can be implemented experimentally with the modern circuit quantum electrodynamic systems where flux qubits can be coupled ultrastrongly to superconducting transmission line resonators.

abstract: The fact that closed timelike curves (CTCs) are permitted by general relativity raises the question as to how quantum systems behave when time travel to the past occurs. Research into answering this question by utilising the quantum circuit formalism has given rise to two theories: Deutschian-CTCs (D-CTCs) and "postselected" CTCs (P-CTCs). In this paper the quantum circuit approach is thoroughly reviewed, and the strengths and shortcomings of D-CTCs and P-CTCs are presented in view of their non-linearity and time travel paradoxes. In particular, the "equivalent circuit model"---which aims to make equivalent predictions to D-CTCs, while avoiding some of the difficulties of the original theory---is shown to contain errors. The discussion of D-CTCs and P-CTCs is used to motivate an analysis of the features one might require of a theory of quantum time travel, following which two overlapping classes of new theories are identified. One such theory, the theory of "transition probability" CTCs (T-CTCs), is fully developed. The theory of T-CTCs is shown not to have certain undesirable features---such as time travel paradoxes, the ability to distinguish non-orthogonal states with certainty, and the ability to clone or delete arbitrary pure states---that are present with D-CTCs and P-CTCs. The problems with non-linear extensions to quantum mechanics are discussed in relation to the interpretation of these theories, and the physical motivations of all three theories are discussed and compared.

abstract: While cavity cooling of a single trapped emitter was demonstrated, cooling of many particles in an array of harmonic traps needs investigation and poses a question of scalability. This work investigates the cooling of a one dimensional atomic array to the ground state of motion via the interaction with the single mode field of a high-finesse cavity. The key factor ensuring the cooling is found to be the mechanical inhomogeneity of the traps. Furthermore it is shown that the pumped cavity mode does not only mediate the cooling but also provides the necessary inhomogeneity if its periodicity differs from the one of the array. This configuration results in the ground state cooling of several tens of atoms within a few milliseconds, a timescale compatible with current experimental conditions. Moreover, the cooling rate scaling with the atom number reveals a drastic change of the dynamics with the size of the array: atoms are either cooled independently, or via collective modes. In the latter case the cavity mediated atom interaction destructively slows down the cooling as well as increases the mean occupation number, quadratically with the atom number. Finally, an order of magnitude speed up of the cooling is predicted as an outcome the optimization scheme based on the adjustment of the array versus the cavity mode periodicity.

The nature of the fluctuations that are inevitably present in SASE-FEL pulses is shown to play a pivotal role in the success of the decorrelation. Our analysis is performed in connection with specific recent experimental results from FLASH in the soft X-ray regime.

abstract: We consider arbitrary quantum wire networks modelled by finite, noncompact, connected quantum graphs in the presence of an external magnetic field. We find a general formula for the total scattering matrix of the network in terms of its local scattering properties and its metric structure. This is applied to a quantum ring with $N$ external edges. Connecting the external edges of the ring to heat reservoirs, we study the quantum transport on the graph in ambient magnetic field. We consider two types of dynamics on the ring: the free Schr\"odinger and the free massless Dirac equations. For each case, a detailed study of the thermal noise is performed analytically. Interestingly enough, in presence of a magnetic field, the standard linear Johnson-Nyquist law for the low temperature behaviour of the thermal noise becomes nonlinear. The precise regime of validity of this effect is discussed and a typical signature of the underlying dynamics is observed.

abstract: Can quantum mechanics help us in building intelligent robots and agents? One of the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the capacity to learn from experience. However, a major bottleneck for agents to learn in any real-life situation is the size and complexity of the corresponding task environment. Owing to, e.g., a large space of possible strategies, learning is typically slow. Even for a moderate task environment, it may simply take too long to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is impatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be unable to cope with the situation and to learn at all. Here we show that quantum physics can help and provide a significant speed-up for active learning as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. We introduce a large class of quantum learning agents for which we show a quadratic boost in their active learning efficiency over their classical analogues. This result will be particularly relevant for applications involving complex task environments.

Specifically, on the basis of simple mathematical analysis we show how the interaction between a bipartite entangled system and a photon bath representing the environment can efface the oscillations in the coincidence-detection rate of the interferometer. We discuss the dependence of this kind of decoherence on the photon energy and density.

abstract: We show that if an efficient classical representation of the dynamics exists, optimal control problems on many-body quantum systems can be solved efficiently with finite precision. We show that the size of the space of parameters necessary to solve quantum optimal control problems defined on pure, mixed states and unitaries is polynomially bounded from the size of the of the set of reachable states in polynomial time. We provide a bound for the minimal time necessary to perform the optimal process given the bandwidth of the control pulse, that is the continuous version of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. We explore the connection between entanglement present in the system and complexity of the control problem, showing that one-dimensional slightly entangled dynamics can be efficiently controlled. Finally, we quantify how noise affects the presented results.

abstract: The maximum speed with which information can propagate in a quantum many-body system directly affects how quickly disparate parts of the system can become correlated and how difficult the system will be to describe numerically. For systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a constant-velocity bound that limits correlations to within a linear effective light cone. However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems with long-range interactions, since the best long-range bound is too loose to give the correct light-cone shape for any known spin model and since analytic solutions rarely exist. In this work, we experimentally determine the spatial and time-dependent correlations of a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system evolving under a long-range Ising- or XY-model Hamiltonian. For several different interaction ranges, we extract the shape of the light cone and measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. In many cases we find increasing propagation velocities, which violate the Lieb-Robinson prediction, and in one instance cannot be explained by any existing theory. Our results demonstrate that even modestly-sized quantum simulators are well-poised for studying complicated many-body systems that are intractable to classical computation.

abstract: Successful implementation of several quantum information and communication protocols require distributing entangled pairs of quantum bits in reliable manner. While there exists a substantial amount of recent theoretical and experimental activities dealing with non-Markovian quantum dynamics, experimental application and verification of the usefulness of memory-effects for quantum information tasks is still missing. We combine these two aspects and show experimentally that a recently introduced concept of nonlocal memory effects allows to protect and distribute polarization entangled pairs of photons in efficient manner within polarization-maintaining (PM) optical fibers. The introduced scheme is based on correlating the environments, i.e. frequencies of the polarization entangled photons, before their physical distribution. When comparing to the case without nonlocal memory effects, we demonstrate at least 12-fold improvement in the channel, or fiber length, for preserving the highly-entangled initial polarization states of photons against dephasing.

abstract: Description of nonclassicality of states has hitherto been through violation of Bell inequality and non-separability, with the latter being a stronger constraint. In this paper, we show that this can be further sharpened, by introducing the concept of classical simulation. A state admits classical simulation if it can be mimicked fully by a separable state of higher dimension. A nonclassical state, which we call exceptional, does not admit classical simulation. Focusing on two qubit states, we show that exceptionality is more stringent than violation of Bell inequality, and involves an intricate interplay of coherence and entanglement. The new criterion is shown to provide a natural description of entangled states which respect Bell inequality, and also a way of enumerating the classical resources that are required to simulate a quantum state. Possible implications to quantum dynamics and quantum information are briefly touched upon.

abstract: Laser-light (coherent-state) modulation is sufficient to achieve the ultimate (Holevo) capacity of classical communication over a lossy and noisy optical channel, but requires a receiver that jointly detects long modulated codewords with highly nonlinear quantum operations, which are near-impossible to realize using current technology. We analyze the capacity of the lossy-noisy optical channel when the transmitter uses coherent state modulation but the receiver is restricted to a general quantum-limited Gaussian receiver, i.e., one that may involve arbitrary combinations of Gaussian operations (passive linear optics: beamsplitters and phase-shifters, second order nonlinear optics (or active linear optics): squeezers, along with homodyne or heterodyne detection measurements) and any amount of classical feedforward within the receiver. Under these assumptions, we show that the Gaussian receiver that attains the maximum mutual information is either homodyne detection, heterodyne detection, or time sharing between the two, depending upon the received power level. In other words, our result shows that to exceed the theoretical limit of conventional coherent optical communications, one has to incorporate non-Gaussian, i.e., third or higher-order nonlinear operations in the receiver. Finally we compare our Gaussian receiver limit with experimentally feasible non-Gaussian receivers and show that in the regime of low received photon flux, it is possible to overcome the Gaussian receiver limit by relatively simple non-Gaussian receivers based on photon counting.

abstract: We introduce a class of quantum adiabatic evolutions that we claim may be interpreted as the equivalents of the unitary gates of the quantum gate model. We argue that these gates form a universal set and may therefore be used as building blocks in the construction of arbitrary `adiabatic circuits', analogously to the manner in which gates are used in the circuit model. One implication of the above construction is that arbitrary classical boolean circuits as well as gate model circuits may be directly translated to adiabatic algorithms with no additional resources or complexities. We show that while these adiabatic algorithms fail to exhibit certain aspects of the inherent fault tolerance of traditional quantum adiabatic algorithms, they may have certain other experimental advantages acting as quantum gates.

An optimal cavity drive pulse is chosen using a genetic search algorithm, leading to a maximum combined readout and preparation fidelity of 91.9% with a measurement time of Tmeas = 200ns. Using post-selection to remove preparation errors caused by heating, we realize a combined preparation and readout fidelity of 94.3%.

Our scheme combines the quantum multi-parameter estimation and the least square linear fitting method to achieve the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB). We show that the estimated quantity achieves the Heisenberg-scaling accuracy. In single parameter estimation with assumption that the magnetic field is strictly linear, two optimal measurements can achieve the identical Heisenberg-scaling accuracy. Proper interpretation of the super-Heisenberg-scaling accuracy is presented. The scheme of quantum metrology combined with data fitting provides a new method in fast high precision measurements.

abstract: The security of quantum key distribution protocols is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. However, a precise analysis of the security properties requires tools from both classical cryptography and information theory. Here, we employ recent results in non-asymptotic classical information theory to show that information reconciliation imposes fundamental limitations on the amount of secret key that can be extracted in the finite key regime. In particular, we find that an often used approximation for the information leakage during information reconciliation is flawed and we propose an improved estimate.

abstract: We analyze a scheme to entangle the movable mirrors of two spatially separated nanoresonators via a broadband squeezed light. We show that it is possible to transfer the EPR-type continuous-variable entanglement from the squeezed light to the mechanical motion of the movable mirrors. An optimal entanglement transfer is achieved when the nanoresonators are tuned at resonance with the vibrational frequencies of the movable mirrors and when strong optomechanical coupling is attained. Stationary entanglement of the states of the movable mirrors as strong as that of the input squeezed light can be obtained for sufficiently large optomechanical cooperativity, achievable in currently available optomechanical systems. The scheme can be used to implement long distance quantum state transfer provided that the squeezed light interacts with the nanoresonators.

abstract: Linear optical quantum Fredkin gate can be applied to quantum computing and quantum multi-user communication network. In the existing linear optical scheme, two single photon detectors (SPDs) are used to heralding the success of the quantum Fredkin gate while they have no photon count. But analysis results show that for non-perfect SPD the lower the detector efficiency, the higher the heralded success rate by this scheme. We propose an improved linear optical quantum Fredkin gate by designing a new heralding scheme with an auxiliary qubit and only one SPD, in which the higher the detection efficiency of the heralding detector, the higher the success rate of the gate. The new heralding scheme can also work efficiently under non-ideal single photon source. Based on this quantum Fredkin gate, large-scale quantum switching networks can be built. As an example, a quantum Benes network in which only one SPD is used is shown.

abstract: The nonclassicality of single-mode quantum states is studied in relation to the entanglement created by a beam splitter. It is shown that properly defined quantifications -- based on the quantum superposition principle -- of the amounts of nonclassicality and entanglement are strictly related to each other. This can be generalized to the amount of genuine multipartite entanglement, created from a nonclassical state by an N splitter. As a consequence, a single-mode state of a given amount of nonclassicality is fully equivalent, as a resource, to exactly the same amount of entanglement. This relation is also considered in the context of multipartite entanglement and multimode nonclassicality.

abstract: We provide a general framework for the identification of open quantum systems. By looking at the input-output behavior, we try to identify the system inside a black box in which some Markovian time-evolution takes place. Due to the generally irreversible nature of the dynamics, it is difficult to assure full controllability over the system. Still, we show that the system is identifiable up to similarity under a certain rank condition. The framework also covers situations relevant to standard quantum process tomography, where we do not have enough control over the system but have a tomographically complete set of initial states and observables. Remarkably, the similarity cannot in general be reduced to unitarity even for unitary systems, and the spectra of Hamiltonians are not identifiable without additional knowledge.

abstract: Considering the two-photon exchange interaction between n coupled cavities each of them containing a two level atom, the atomic and photonic state transfer is investigated. In fact, n atom-cavity systems are considered to be distributed on the nodes of an uncolored Cayley network and interact with each other via the adjacency matrix of the corresponding network. Then, by employing the photon-excitation conservation and also the algebraic structure of the networks, such as irreducible characters of the groups associated with the networks, some suitable basis for the atom-cavity state space is introduced based on the corresponding generalized Fourier transform, so that the Hamiltonian of the whole system, is block diagonalized with two-dimensional blocks. Then, by solving the corresponding Schrodinger equation exactly, quantum state transfer and also entanglement generation between the atoms or the photons are discussed. For instance, the probability amplitudes associated with the photon transition between the cavities or excitation transition between the atoms are obtained in terms of the irreducibles characters of the corresponding network and the hopping parameter ? between the cavities.

abstract: Absolutely separable states form a special subset of the set of all separable states, as they remain separable under any global unitary transformation unlike other separable states. In this work we consider the set of absolutely separable bipartite states and show that it is convex and compact in any arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space. Through a generic approach of construction of suitable hermitian operators we prove the completeness of the separation axiom for identifying any separable state that is not absolutely separable. We demonstrate the action of such witness operators in different qudit systems. Examples of mixed separable systems are provided, pointing out the utility of the witness in entanglement creation using quantum gates. Decomposition of witnesses in terms of spin operators or photon polarizations facilitates their measureability for qubit states.

abstract: We propose a new generalised formalism for estimating the quantum phase uncertainty of pure and mixed continuous-variable quantum states and compare this with the phase uncertainty given by the quantum Fisher information. In order to preserve the Hermiticity of the operators, we use the Heisenberg and Schroedinger uncertainty relations to derive expressions for the phase uncertainty from generalised Susskind-Glogower operators. This formalism not only offers the possibility of directly measuring quantum phase uncertainties in a cavity-QED experiment but also gives a significant computational saving over the quantum Fisher information approach, which requires diagonalisation of the density matrix.

abstract: This work is motivated by a quite general question: Under which circumstances are the capacities of information transmission systems continuous? The research is explicitly carried out on arbitrarily varying quantum channels (AVQCs). We give an explicit example that answers the recent question whether the transmission of messages over AVQCs can benefit from distribution of randomness between the legitimate sender and receiver in the affirmative. The specific class of channels introduced in that example is then extended to show that the deterministic capacity does have discontinuity points, while that behaviour is, at the same time, not generic: We show that it is continuous around its positivity points. This is in stark contrast to the randomness-assisted capacity, which is always continuous in the channel. Our results imply that the deterministic message transmission capacity of an AVQC can be discontinuous only in points where it is zero, while the randomness assisted capacity is nonzero. Apart from the zero-error capacities, this is the first result that shows a discontinuity of a capacity for a large class of quantum channels. The continuity of the respective capacity for memoryless quantum channels had, among others, been listed as an open problem on the problem page of the ITP Hannover for about six years before it was proven to be continuous. We also quantify the interplay between the distribution of finite amounts of randomness between the legitimate sender and receiver, the (nonzero) decoding error with respect to the average error criterion that can be achieved over a finite number of channel uses and the number of messages that can be sent. This part of our results also applies to entanglement- and strong subspace transmission. In addition, we give a new sufficient criterion for the entanglement transmission capacity with randomness assistance to vanish.

abstract: The key to explaining a wide range of quantum phenomena is understanding how entanglement propagates around many-body systems. Furthermore, the controlled distribution of entanglement is of fundamental importance for quantum communication and computation. In many situations, quasiparticles are the carriers of information around a quantum system and are expected to distribute entanglement in a fashion determined by the system interactions. Here we report on the observation of magnon quasiparticle dynamics in a one-dimensional many-body quantum system of trapped ions representing an Ising spin model. Using the ability to tune the effective interaction range, and to prepare and measure the quantum state at the individual particle level, we observe new quasiparticle phenomena. For the first time, we reveal the entanglement distributed by quasiparticles around a many-body system. Second, for long-range interactions we observe the divergence of quasiparticle velocity and breakdown of the light-cone picture that is valid for short-range interactions. Our results will allow experimental studies of a wide range of phenomena, such as quantum transport, thermalisation, localisation and entanglement growth, and represent a first step towards a new quantum-optical regime with on-demand quasiparticles with tunable non-linear interactions.

abstract: We consider the integration of quantum emitters into a negative permeability metamaterial design in order to introduce tunability as well as nonlinear behavior. The unit cell of our metamaterial is a ring of metamolecules, each consisting of a metal nanoparticle and a two-level semiconductor quantum dot (QD). Without the QDs, the ring of the unit cell is known to act as an artificial optical magnetic resonator. By adding the QDs we show that a Fano interference profile is introduced into the magnetic field scattered from the ring. This induced interference is shown to cause an appreciable effect in the collective magnetic resonance of the unit cell. We find that the interference provides a means to tune the response of the negative permeability metamaterial. The exploitation of the QD's inherent nonlinearity is proposed to modulate the metamaterial's magnetic response with a separate control field.

We will argue that Salih's conclusions are invalid because he relied on a common sense argument: if it is true that a system has property A and it is true that it has property B, then the system has properties A and B together. This argument fails for pre- and postselected quantum systems.

abstract: We introduce a new relativistic orthogonal states quantum key distribution protocol which leverages the properties of both quantum mechanics and special relativity to securely encode multiple bits onto the spatio-temporal modes of a single photon. If the protocol is implemented using a single photon source, it can have a key generation rate faster than the repetition rate of the source, enabling faster secure communication than is possible with existing protocols. Further, we provide a proof that the protocol is secure and give a method of implementing the protocol using line-of-sight and fiber optic channels.

abstract: We have developed a quantum annealing processor, based on an array of tunably coupled rf-SQUID flux qubits, fabricated in a superconducting integrated circuit process [1]. Implementing this type of processor at a scale of 512 qubits and 1472 programmable inter-qubit couplers and operating at ~ 20 mK has required attention to a number of considerations that one may ignore at the smaller scale of a few dozen or so devices. Here we discuss some of these considerations, and the delicate balance necessary for the construction of a practical processor that respects the demanding physical requirements imposed by a quantum algorithm. In particular we will review some of the design trade-offs at play in the floor-planning of the physical layout, driven by the desire to have an algorithmically useful set of inter-qubit couplers, and the simultaneous need to embed programmable control circuitry into the processor fabric. In this context we have developed a new ultra-low power embedded superconducting digital-to-analog flux converters (DACs) used to program the processor with zero static power dissipation, optimized to achieve maximum flux storage density per unit area. The 512 single-stage, 3520 two-stage, and 512 three-stage flux-DACs are controlled with an XYZ addressing scheme requiring 56 wires. Our estimate of on-chip dissipated energy for worst-case reprogramming of the whole processor is ~ 65 fJ. Several chips based on this architecture have been fabricated and operated successfully at our facility, as well as two outside facilities (see for example [2]).

abstract: We study the generation of entanglement between two species of neutral cold atoms living on an optical ring lattice, where each group of particles can be described by a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space (qu$d$it). Synthetic magnetic fields are exploited to create an entangled state between the pair of qu$d$its. Maximally entangled eigenstates are found for well defined values of the Aharonov-Bohm phase, which are zero energy eigenstates of both the kinetic and interacting parts of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, making them quite exceptional and robust against certain non-perturbative fluctuations of the Hamiltonian. We propose a protocol to reach the maximally entangled state (MES) by starting from an initially prepared ground state. Also, an indirect method to detect the MES by measuring the current of the particles is proposed.

abstract: We analyze the Purcell relaxation rate of a superconducting qubit coupled to a resonator, which is coupled to a transmission line and pumped by an external microwave drive. Considering the typical regime of the qubit measurement, we focus on the case when the qubit frequency is significantly detuned from the resonator frequency. Surprisingly, the Purcell rate decreases when the strength of the microwave drive is increased. This suppression becomes significant in the nonlinear regime. In the presence of the microwave drive, the loss of photons to the transmission line also causes excitation of the qubit; however, the excitation rate is typically much smaller than the relaxation rate. Our analysis also applies to a more general case of a two-level quantum system coupled to a cavity.

We have realized a quantum node based on a 3D microwave superconducting cavity parametrically coupled to a transmission line by a Josephson ring modulator. We first demonstrate the time-controlled capture, storage and retrieval of an optimally shaped propagating microwave field, with an efficiency as high as 80%. We then demonstrate a second essential ability, which is the timed-controlled generation of an entangled state distributed between the node and a microwave channel.

abstract: We demonstrate a high bit-rate quantum random number generator by interferometric detection of phase diffusion in a gain-switched DFB laser diode. Gain switching at few-GHz frequencies produces a train of bright pulses with nearly equal amplitudes and random phases. An unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer is used to interfere subsequent pulses and thereby generate strong random-amplitude pulses, which are detected and digitized to produce a high-rate random bit string. Using established models of semiconductor laser field dynamics, we predict a regime of high visibility interference and nearly complete vacuum-fluctuation-induced phase diffusion between pulses. These are confirmed by measurement of pulse power statistics at the output of the interferometer. Using a 5.825 GHz excitation rate and 14-bit digitization, we observe 43 Gbps quantum randomness generation.

abstract: Quantum walks on graphs can model physical processes and serve as efficient tools in quantum information theory. Once we admit random variations in the connectivity of the underlying graph, we arrive at the problem of percolation, where the long-time behaviour appears untreatable with direct numerical methods. We develop novel analytic methods based on the theory of random unitary operations which help us to determine explicitly the asymptotic dynamics of quantum walks on 2D finite integer lattices with percolation. Based on this theory we find new unexpected features of percolated walks like asymptotic position inhomogeneity or special directional symmetry breaking.

abstract: Entanglement purification allows the creation of qubit pairs of arbitrarily high fidelity with respect to a maximally entangled state, starting from a larger number of low-fidelity pairs. Purification requires quantum memory, a role for which electron spins are well suited. However, using existing recurrence protocols involving symmetric local two-qubit operations for spin qubits turns out to be rather unpractical. We present an efficient purification protocol requiring only a single pulsed Heisenberg- or XY-type exchange interaction between two qubit pairs. In contrast to known protocols, we allow for asymmetric bilateral two-qubit operations where the two communication parties operate differently on their qubits. In the optimal version of our protocol, the local two-qubit interactions in the case of Heisenberg exchange correspond to the $\sqrt{\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate and its inverse.

abstract: We treat control of several two-level atoms interacting with one mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity. This provides a useful model to study pertinent aspects of quantum control in infinite dimensions via the emergence of infinite-dimensional system algebras. Hence we address problems arising with infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and those of unbounded operators. For the models considered, these problems can be solved by splitting the set of control Hamiltonians into two subsets: The first obeys an abelian symmetry and can be treated in terms of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and strongly closed subgroups of the unitary group of the system Hilbert space. The second breaks this symmetry, and its discussion introduces new arguments. Yet, full controllability can be achieved in a strong sense: e.g., in a time dependent Jaynes-Cummings model we show that, by tuning coupling constants appropriately, every unitary of the coupled system (atoms and cavity) can be approximated with arbitrarily small error.

abstract: Quantum simulators, in which well controlled quantum systems are used to reproduce the dynamics of less understood ones, have the potential to explore physics that is inaccessible to modeling with classical computers. However, checking the results of such simulations will also become classically intractable as system sizes increase. In this work, we introduce and implement a coherent imaging spectroscopic technique to validate a quantum simulation, much as magnetic resonance imaging exposes structure in condensed matter. We use this method to determine the energy levels and interaction strengths of a fully-connected quantum many-body system. Additionally, we directly measure the size of the critical energy gap near a quantum phase transition. We expect this general technique to become an important verification tool for quantum simulators once experiments advance beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations and exceed the resources of conventional computers.

abstract: We study an array of dissipative tunnel-coupled cavities, each interacting with an incoherently pumped two-level emitter. For cavities in the lasing regime, we find correlations between the light fields of distant cavities, despite the dissipation and the incoherent nature of the pumping mechanism. These correlations decay exponentially with distance for arrays in any dimension but become increasingly long ranged with increasing photon tunneling between adjacent cavities. The interaction-dominated and the tunneling-dominated regimes show markedly different scaling of the correlation length which always remains finite due to the finite photon trapping time. We propose a series of observables to characterize the spontaneous build-up of collective coherence in the system.

abstract: Precise identification of parameters governing quantum processes is a critical task for quantum information and communication technologies. In this work we consider a setting where system evolution is determined by a parameterized Hamiltonian, and the task is to estimate these parameters from temporal records of a restricted set of system observables (time traces). Based on the notion of system realization from linear systems theory we develop a constructive algorithm that provides estimates of the unknown parameters directly from these time traces. We illustrate the algorithm and its robustness to measurement noise by applying it to a one-dimensional spin chain model with variable couplings.

abstract: It is proposed that the recent controversy over "time-symmetric quantum counterfactuals" (TSQCs), based on the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz Rule for measurements of pre- and post-selected systems, can be clarified by taking TSQCs to be counterfactuals with a specific type of compound antecedent. In that case, inconsistency proofs such as that of Sharp and Shanks (1993) are not applicable, and the main issue becomes not whether such statements are true, but whether they are nontrivial. The latter question is addressed and answered in the negative. Thus it is concluded that TSQCs, understood as counterfactuals with a compound antecedent, are true but only trivially so, and provide no new contingent information about specific quantum systems (except in special cases already identified in the literature).

In this way, we provide a long sought solution of a cascade of models with immediate relevance in different physical fields, including i) quantum optics: two-level atom in single mode cross electric and magnetic fields; ii) solid state physics: electrons in semiconductors with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling; iii) mesoscopic physics: Josephson junctions flux-qubit quantum circuits.

abstract: The realisation of large-scale quantum computing is no longer simply a hardware question. The rapid development of quantum technology has resulted in dozens of control and programming problems that should be directed towards the classical computer science and engineering community. One such problem is known as Pauli tracking. Methods for implementing quantum algorithms that are compatible with crucial error correction technology utilise extensive quantum teleportation protocols. These protocols are intrinsically probabilistic and result in correction operators that occur as byproducts of teleportation. These byproduct operators do not need to be corrected in the quantum hardware itself. Instead, byproduct operators are tracked through the circuit and output results reinterpreted. This tracking is routinely ignored in quantum information as it is assumed that tracking algorithms will eventually be developed. In this work we help fill this gap and present an algorithm for tracking byproduct operators through a quantum computation. We formulate this work based on quantum gate sets that are compatible with all major forms of quantum error correction and demonstrate the completeness of the algorithm.

abstract: Large weak values have been used to amplify the sensitivity of a linear response signal for detecting changes in a small parameter, which has also enabled a simple method for precise parameter estimation. However, producing a large weak value requires a low postselection probability for an ancilla degree of freedom, which limits the utility of the technique. We propose an improvement to this method that uses entanglement to increase the efficiency. We show that by entangling and postselecting $n$ ancillas, the postselection probability can be increased by a factor of $n$ while keeping the weak value fixed (compared to $n$ uncorrelated attempts with one ancilla), which is the optimal scaling with $n$ that is expected from quantum metrology. Furthermore, we show the surprising result that the quantum Fisher information about the detected parameter can be almost entirely preserved in the postselected state, which allows the sensitive estimation to approximately saturate the optimal quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. To illustrate this protocol we provide simple quantum circuits that can be implemented using current experimental realizations of three entangled qubits.

abstract: We characterise the eigenfunctions of an equilateral triangle billiard in terms of its nodal domains. The number of nodal domains has a quadratic form in terms of the quantum numbers, with a non-trivial number-theoretic factor. The patterns of the eigenfunctions follow a group-theoretic connection in a way that makes them predictable as one goes from one state to another. Extensive numerical investigations bring out the distribution functions of the mode number and signed areas. The statistics of the boundary intersections is also treated analytically. Finally, the distribution functions of the nodal loop count and the nodal counting function are shown to contain information about the classical periodic orbits using the semiclassical trace formula. We believe that the results belong generically to non-separable systems, thus extending the previous works which are concentrated on separable and chaotic systems.

abstract: We study the Renyi entanglement entropy of an interval in a periodic fermionic chain for a general eigenstate of a free, translational invariant Hamiltonian. In order to analytically compute the entropy we use two technical tools. The first one is used to reduce logarithmically the complexity of the problem and the second one to compute the R\'enyi entropy of the chosen subsystem. We introduce new strategies to perform the computations, derive new expressions for the entropy of these general states and show the perfect agreement of the analytical computations and the numerical outcome. Finally we discuss the physical interpretation of our results and generalise them to compute the entanglement entropy for a fragment of a fermionic ladder.

The Schr\"odinger equation is algebraically solvable and the eigenvalues are obtained as the zeros of an expression explicitly given in terms of Gamma functions. The spectrum consists of one real eigenvalue and an infinite set of pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues.

abstract: To certify that an experimentally implemented quantum transformation is a certain unitary operation U on a d-dimensional Hilbert space, it suffices to determine fidelities of output states for d+1 suitably chosen pure input states [Reich et al., Phys. Rev. A 88, 042309 (2013)]. The set of these d+1 probe states can consist of d orthogonal states that form a basis and one additional state which is a balanced superposition of all d basis states. Here we provide an analytical lower bound on quantum process fidelity for two-qubit quantum gates which results from the knowledge of average state fidelity for the basis states and the fidelity of the superposition state. We compare this bound with the Hofmann bound that is based on knowledge of average state fidelities for two mutually unbiased bases. We also discuss possible extension of our findings to N-qubit operations.

abstract: Strong rotating magnetic fields may cause a precession of the electron's spin around the rotation axis of the magnetic field. The superposition of two counterpropagating laser beams with circular polarization and opposite helicity features such a rotating magnetic field component but also carries spin. The laser's spin density, that can be expressed in terms of the lase's electromagnetic fields and potentials, couples to the electron's spin via a relativistic correction to the Pauli equation. We show that the quantum mechanical interaction of the electron's spin with the laser's rotating magnetic field and with the laser's spin density counteract each other in such a way that a net spin rotation remains with a precession frequency that is much smaller than the frequency one would expect from the rotating magnetic field alone. In particular, the frequency scales differently with the laser's electric field strength depending on if relativistic corrections are taken into account or not. Thus, the relativistic coupling of the electron's spin to the laser's spin density changes the dynamics not only quantitatively but also qualitatively as compared to the nonrelativistic theory. The electron's spin dynamics is a genuine quantum mechanical relativistic effect.

abstract: We begin with a review of the famous thought experiment that was proposed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) and mathematically formulated by Bell; the outcomes of which challenge the completeness of quantum mechanics and the locality of Nature. We then suggest a reinterpretation of the EPR experiment that utilizes observer complementarity; a concept from quantum gravity which allows spatially separated observers to have their own, independent reference frames. The resulting picture provides a self-consistent resolution of the situation that does not jeopardize causality nor unitarity, nor does it resort to ''spooky'' (non-local) interactions. Our conclusion is that EPR and Bell rely on an overly strong definition of locality that is in conflict with fundamental physics.

abstract: The interaction Hamiltonian of an electron and a quasi-monochromatic pulse of a strong quantized electromagnetic field is examined. Canonical transformations of the field variables are found that allow the division of the system's Hamiltonian in two parts. The first one describes the interaction between an electron and a single collective mode of the field. The properties of this mode are defined by the superposition of the modes corresponding to the pulse wave packet. The second part describes the field fluctuations relatively to the collective mode. The field intensity, pulse duration and transversal spread are estimated for which a single-mode approximation can be used for the system's description.

abstract: We consider one-way quantum state merging and entanglement distillation under compound and arbitrarily varying source models. Regarding quantum compound sources, where the source is memoryless, but the source state an unknown member of a certain set of density matrices, we continue investigations begun in the work of Bjelakovi\'c et. al. [Universal quantum state merging, J. Math. Phys. 54, 032204 (2013)] and determine the classical as well as entanglement cost of state merging. We further investigate quantum state merging and entanglement distillation protocols for arbitrarily varying quantum sources (AVQS). In the AVQS model, the source state is assumed to vary in an arbitrary manner for each source output due to environmental fluctuations or adversarial manipulation. We determine the one-way entanglement distillation capacity for AVQS, where we invoke the famous robustification and elimination techniques introduced by R. Ahlswede. Regarding quantum state merging for AVQS we show by example, that the robustification and elimination based approach generally leads to suboptimal entanglement as well as classical communication rates.

abstract: In this work we propose a novel single-atom interferometer based on a fully two-dimensional spatial adiabatic passage process using a system of three identical harmonic traps in a triangular geometry. While the transfer of a single atom from the ground state of one trap to the ground state of the most distant one can successfully be achieved in a robust way for a broad range of parameter values, we point out the existence of a specific geometrical configuration of the traps for which a crossing of two energy eigenvalues occurs and the transfer of the atom fails. Instead the wavefunction is robustly split into a coherent superposition between two of the traps. We show that this process can be used to construct a single-atom interferometer and discuss its performance in terms of the final population distribution among the asymptotic eigenstates of the individual traps. This interferometric scheme could be used to study space dependent fields from ultrashort to relatively large distances, or the decay of the coherence of superposition states as a function of the distance.

abstract: In a recent work [8], we have described a formulation of a model quantum field theory in terms of a multi-time wave function and proposed a suitable system of multi-time Schroedinger equations governing the evolution of that wave function. Here, we provide further evidence that multi-time wave functions provide a viable formulation of relevant quantum field theories by describing a multi-time formulation, analogous to the one in [8], of another model quantum field theory. This model involves three species of particles, say x-particles, anti-x-particles, and y-particles, and postulates that a y-particle can decay into a pair consisting of an x and an anti-x particle, and that an x-anti-x pair, when they meet, annihilate each other creating a y-particle. (Alternatively, the model can also be interpreted as representing beta decay.) The wave function is a multi-time version of a time-dependent state vector in Fock space (or rather, the appropriate product of Fock spaces) in the particle-position representation. We write down multi-time Schroedinger equations and verify that they are consistent, provided that an even number of the three particle species involved are fermionic.

We furthermore investigate how the level of phase due to single-point phase defects and coin settings influence the strength of the localization signature.

abstract: Motivated by recent experiments with ultra-cold matter, we derive a new bound on the propagation of information in $D$-dimensional lattice models exhibiting $1/r^{\alpha}$ interactions with $\alpha>D$. The bound contains two terms: One accounts for the short-ranged part of the interactions, giving rise to a bounded velocity and reflecting the persistence of locality out to intermediate distances, while the other contributes a power-law decay at longer distances. We demonstrate that these two contributions not only bound but, except at long times, \emph{qualitatively reproduce} the short- and long-distance dynamical behavior following a local quench in an $XY$ chain and a transverse-field Ising chain. In addition to describing dynamics in numerous intractable long-range interacting lattice models, our results can be experimentally verified in a variety of ultracold-atomic and solid-state systems.

This contradicts to a recent Letter [arXiv:1303.4284] claiming that SSEs, under most general conditions, enforce complete-positivity. The general form and parametrization of the SSE in the Letter is different from an alternative simpler result, the difference is shown to be completely redundant because of the gauge-freedom of the state vector's phase.

abstract: Recently it has been demonstrated that the combination of weak-continuous position detection with detuned parametric driving can lead to significant steady-state mechanical squeezing, far beyond the 3 dB limit normally associated with parametric driving. In this work, we show the close connection between this detuned scheme and quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of a single mechanical quadrature. In particular, we show that applying an experimentally realistic detuned parametric drive to a cavity optomechanical system allows one to effectively realize a QND measurement despite being in the bad-cavity limit. In the limit of strong squeezing, we show that this scheme offers significant advantages over standard backaction evasion, not only by allowing operation in the weak measurement and low efficiency regimes, but also in terms of the purity of the mechanical state.

abstract: Nonequilibrium steady states are investigated in a coupled cavity QED array system which is pumped by a thermal bath and dissipated through cavity loss. In the coherent (non-zero photon amplitude) phase, plateau regions appear, where the steady states become unchanged against the variation of the chemical potential of the thermal bath. The cavity loss plays a crucial role for the plateaus: the plateaus appear only if the cavity loss exists, and the photon leakage current, which is induced by the loss, is essential to the mechanism of the plateaus.

We also derive a 3-local parent Hamiltonian for this model, whose ground state is non-degenerate.

Kastner (2003) analyzed this controversy and concluded that there are time-symmetric quantum counterfactuals which are consistent, but they turn out to be trivial. I correct Kastner's misquotation of my defense of time-symmetric quantum counterfactuals and explain their non-trivial aspects, thus contesting the claim that counterfactuals have to be time-asymmetric.

abstract: The basic strategy underlying models of spontaneous wave function collapse (collapse models) is to modify the Schroedinger equation by including nonlinear stochastic terms, which tend to localize wave functions in space in a dynamical manner. These terms have negligible effects on microscopic systems-therefore their quantum behaviour is practically preserved. On the other end, since the strength of these new terms scales with the mass of the system, they become dominant at the macroscopic level, making sure that wave functions of macro-objects are always well-localized in space. We will review these basic features. By changing the dynamics of quantum systems, collapse models make predictions, which are different from standard quantum mechanical predictions. Although they are difficult to detect, we discuss the most relevant scenarios, where such deviations can be observed

abstract: Protecting quantum information from decoherence due to environmental noise is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation. To this end, standard quantum error correction employs parallel projective measurements of individual particles, which makes the system extremely complicated. Here we propose measurement-free topological protection in two dimension without any selective addressing of individual particles. We make use of engineered dissipative dynamics and feedback operations to reduce the entropy generated by decoherence in such a way that quantum information is topologically protected. We calculate an error threshold, below which quantum information is protected, without assuming selective addressing, projective measurements, nor instantaneous classical processing. All physical operations are local and translationally invariant, and no parallel projective measurement is required, which implies high scalability. Furthermore, since the engineered dissipative dynamics we utilized has been well studied in quantum simulation, the proposed scheme can be a promising route progressing from quantum simulation to fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

abstract: We establish equations for scalar and fermion fields using results obtained from a study on a phase space representation of quantum theory that we have performed in a previous work. Our approaches are similar to the historical ones to obtain Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations but the main difference is that ours are based on the use of properties of operators called dispersion-codispersion operators. We begin with a brief recall about the dispersion-codispersion operators. Then, introducing a mass operator with its canonical conjugate coordinate and applying rules of quantization, based on the use of dispersion - codispersion operators, we deduce a second order differential operator relation from the relativistic expression relying energy, momentum and mass. Using Dirac matrices, we derive from this second order differential operator relation a first order one. The application of the second order differential operator relation on a scalar function gives the equation for the scalar field and the use of the first order differential operator relation leads to the equation for fermion field.

abstract: The surface code is one the most promising alternatives for implementing fault-tolerant, large-scale quantum information processing. Its high threshold for single-qubit errors under stochastic noise is one of its most attrative features. We develop an exact formulation for the fidelity of the surface code that allows us to probe much further on this promise of strong protection. This formulation goes beyond the stochastic single-qubit error model approximation and can take into account both correlated errors and inhomogeneities in the coupling between physical qubits and the environment. For the case of a bit-flipping environment, we map the complete evolution after one quantum error correction cycle onto the problem of computing correlation functions of a two-dimensional Ising model with boundary fields. Exact results for the fidelity threshold of the surface code are then obtained for several relevant types of noise. Analytical predictions for a representative case are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.

In particular, the open quantum walks can be designed to converge faster to the desired steady state and to increase the probability of detection of the outcome of the computation.

abstract: Long-distance quantum communication relies on storing and retrieving photonic qubits in orthogonal field modes. The available degrees of freedom for photons are polarization, spatial-mode profile, and temporal/spectral profile. To date, methods exist for decomposing, manipulating, and analyzing photons into orthogonal polarization modes and spatial modes. Here we propose and theoretically verify the first highly efficient method to carry out analogous operations for temporally and spectrally overlapping, but field-orthogonal, temporal modes. The method relies on cascaded nonlinear-optical quantum frequency conversion.

abstract: The theory of quantum gravity is aimed to fuse general relativity with quantum theory into a more fundamental framework. The space of quantum gravity provides both the non-fixed causality of general relativity and the quantum uncertainty of quantum mechanics. In a quantum gravity scenario, the causal structure is indefinite and the processes are causally non-separable. In this work, we provide a model for the information processing structure of quantum gravity. We show that the quantum gravity environment is an information resource-pool from which valuable information can be extracted. We analyze the structure of the quantum gravity space and the entanglement of the space-time geometry. We study the information transfer capabilities of quantum gravity space and define the quantum gravity channel. We reveal that the quantum gravity space acts as a background noise on the local environment states. We characterize the properties of the noise of the quantum gravity space and show that it allows the separate local parties to simulate remote outputs from the local environment state, through the process of remote simulation. We characterize the information transfer of the gravity space and the correlation measure functions of the gravity channel. We investigate the process of stimulated storage for quantum gravity memories, a phenomenon that exploits the information resource-pool property of quantum gravity. The results confirm the perception that the benefits of the quantum gravity space can be exploited in quantum computations, particularly in the development of quantum computers.

abstract: We propose an efficient protocol for measuring the concurrence of arbitrary two-photon pure entangled state with the help of the photonic Faraday rotation. In the protocol, the concurrence of the photonic entangled state can be conversed into the total success probability for picking up the odd-parity photonic state. For completing the measurement task, we require some auxiliary three-level atoms, which are trapped in the low-quality cavities. Our protocol can be well realized under current experimental conditions. Moreover, under practical imperfect atom state detection and photonic Faraday rotation conditions, our protocol can also work well. Based on these features, our protocol may be useful in current quantum information processing.

abstract: We present an exact procedure that allows one to calculate the scattering lenth for any potential expressed as an algebraic sum of inverse powers of the interatomic distance. We apply it to (12, $s$) Lennard-Jones potentials, with different values of $s$. The procedure is suitable for a very precise determination of the intensities of the potential corresponding to zeros or poles of the scattering length.

abstract: We introduce quantum information engines that extract work from quantum states and a single thermal reservoir. They may operate under three general conditions: i/ Unitarily Steered evolution (US); ii/ Irreversible Thermalization (IT) and iii/ Isothermal Relaxation (IR), and hence are called USITIR machines. They include novel engines without traditional feedback control mechanisms, as well as versions which also include them. Explicit constructions of USITIR engines are presented for one- and two-qubit states and their maximum extractable work is computed, which is optimal. Optimality is achieved when the notions of controllable thermalizability and density matrix controllability are fullfilled. Then, many-body extensions of USITIR engines are also analyzed and conditions for optimal work extraction are identified. When they are not met, we measure their lack of optimality by means of newly defined uncontrollable entropies, that are explicitly computed for some selected examples. This includes cases of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles.

abstract: Optomechanics, which explores the fundamental coupling between light and mechanical motion, has made important advances in both exploring and manipulating macroscopic mechanical oscillators down to the quantum level. However, dynamical effects related to the vectorial nature of the optomechanical interaction remain to be investigated. Here we study a nanowire with sub-wavelength dimensions strongly coupled to a tightly focused beam of light, enabling ultrasensitive readout of the nanoresonators dynamics. We experimentally determine the vectorial structure of the optomechanical interaction and demonstrate that bidimensional dynamical backaction governs the nanowire dynamics. Moreover, the non-conservative topology of the optomechanical interaction is responsible for a novel canonical signature of strong coupling between the nanoresonator mechanical modes, leading to a topological instability. These results have a universal character and illustrate the increased sensitivity of nanomechanical devices towards topologically varying interactions, opening fundamental perspectives in nanomechanics, optomechanics, ultrasensitive scanning probe force microscopy and nano-optics.

abstract: We investigate secret key rates for the quantum repeater using encoding [L. Jiang et al., Phys. Rev. A 79, 032325 (2009)] and compare them to the standard repeater scheme by Briegel, D\"ur, Cirac, and Zoller. The former scheme has the advantage of a minimal consumption of classical communication. We analyze the trade-off in the secret key rate between the communication time and the required resources. For this purpose, we introduce an error model for the repeater using encoding which allows for input Bell states with a fidelity smaller than one, in contrast to the model given in [L. Jiang et al., Phys. Rev. A 79, 032325 (2009)]. We show that one can correct additional errors in the encoded connection procedure of this repeater and develop a suitable decoding algorithm. Furthermore, we derive the rate of producing entangled pairs for the quantum repeater using encoding and give the minimal parameters (gate quality and initial fidelity) for establishing a nonzero secret key. We find that the generic quantum repeater is optimal regarding the secret key rate per memory per second and show that the encoded quantum repeater using the simple three-qubit repetition code can even have an advantage with respect to the resources compared to other recent quantum repeater schemes with encoding.

abstract: We present a quantum open-system approach to analyze the nonunitary dynamics of a superconducting qubit when it evolves under the influence of external noise. We consider the presence of longitudinal and transverse environmental fluctuations affecting the system's dynamics and model these fluctuations by defining their correlation function in time. By using a Gaussian-like noise correlation, we can study low- and high-frequency noise contribution to decoherence and implement our results in the computation of geometric phases in open quantum systems. We numerically study when the accumulated phase of a solid-state qubit can still be found close to the unitary (Berry) one. Our results can be used to explain experimental measurements of the Berry phase under high-frequency fluctuations and design experimental future setups when manipulating superconducting qubits.

abstract: In this paper, we have given the symmetrical and antisymmetrical spin and space wave functions of three-electron, and further given the full total entanglement states for the three-electron, which are related to their space and spin wave function. When we study particles entanglement we not only consider their spin entanglement and also consider their space entanglement. Otherwise, we find that electrons entanglement are restricted to the teeny range, when electrons exceed the space range, their entanglement should be broken down even disappearance, which is accordance with the experiments results.

abstract: We propose the implementation of a deterministic Hadamard gate for logical photonic qubits encoded in superpositions of coherent states of a harmonic oscillator. The proposed scheme builds on a recently introduced set of conditional operations in the strong dispersive regime of circuit QED [Z. Leghtas et al. Phys. Rev. A. {\bf 87} (2013)]. We further propose an architecture for coupling two such logical qubits and provide a universal set of deterministic quantum gates. Based on parameter values taken from the current state of the art, we give estimates for the achievable gate fidelities accounting for fundamental gate imperfections and finite coherence time due to photon loss.

abstract: Geometric quantum manipulation and Landau-Zener interferometry have been separately explored in many quantum systems. In this Letter, we combine these two approaches to study the dynamics of a superconducting phase qubit. We experimentally demonstrate Landau-Zener interferometry based on the pure geometric phases in this solid-state qubit. We observe the interference caused by a pure geometric phase accumulated in the evolution between two consecutive Landau-Zener transitions, while the dynamical phase is canceled out by a spin-echo pulse. The full controllability of the qubit state as a function of the intrinsically robust geometric phase provides a promising approach for quantum state manipulation.

Raman-couplings during the rising edge of a 50-picosecond laser pulse create a wave packet of pendular states, which propagates in the confining potential formed by the polarizability interaction between the molecule and the laser field. This wave-packet dynamics manifests itself as pronounced oscillations in the degree of alignment with a laser-intensity dependent period.

abstract: With the advent of device independent quantum information processing, nonlocality is nowadays regarded as a resource to implement various tasks. On the analogy of entanglement theory we approach nonlocality from this perspective. In order to do so, we analyze in full detail the operations that can be implemented in this scenario and under which nonlocality cannot increase. This provides a theoretical ground to study how to order and quantify nonlocal behaviours. Finally, we review several nonlocality measures and discuss their validity from this point of view.

abstract: Proving achievability of protocols in quantum Shannon theory usually does not consider the efficiency at which the goal of the protocol can be achieved. Nevertheless it is known that protocols such as coherent state merging are efficiently achievable at optimal rate. We aim to investigate this fact further in a general one-shot setting, by considering certain classes of decoupling theorems and give exact rates for these classes. Moreover we compare results of general decoupling theorems using Haar distributed unitaries with those using smaller sets of operators, in particular $\epsilon$-approximate 2-designs. We also observe the behavior of our rates in special cases such as $\epsilon$ approaching zero and the asymptotic limit.

abstract: In quantum teleportation, the state of a single quantum system is disembodied into classical information and purely quantum correlations, to be later reconstructed onto a second system that has never directly interacted with the first one. This counterintuitive phenomenon is a cornerstone of quantum information science due to its essential role in several important tasks such as the long-distance transmission of quantum information using quantum repeaters. In this context, a challenge of paramount importance is the distribution of entanglement between remote nodes, and to use this entanglement as a resource for long-distance light-to-matter quantum teleportation. Here we demonstrate quantum teleportation of the polarization state of a telecom-wavelength photon onto the state of a solid-state quantum memory. Entanglement is established between a rare-earth-ion doped crystal storing a single photon that is polarization-entangled with a flying telecom-wavelength photon. The latter is jointly measured with another flying qubit carrying the polarization state to be teleported, which heralds the teleportation. The fidelity of the polarization state of the photon retrieved from the memory is shown to be greater than the maximum fidelity achievable without entanglement, even when the combined distances travelled by the two flying qubits is 25 km of standard optical fibre. This light-to-matter teleportation channel paves the way towards long-distance implementations of quantum networks with solid-state quantum memories.

abstract: It has been recently shown, that some of the tripartite boxes admitting bilocal decomposition, lead to non-locality under wiring operation applied to two of the subsystems [R. Gallego et al. Physical Review Letters 109, 070401 (2012)]. In the following, we study this phenomenon quantitatively. Basing on the known classes of boxes closed under wirings, we introduced multipartite monotones which are counterparts of bipartite ones - the non-locality cost and robustness of non-locality. We then provide analytical lower bounds on both the monotones in terms of the Maximal Non-locality which can be obtained by Wirings (MWN). We prove also upper bounds for the MWN of a given box, based on the weight of boxes signaling in a particular direction, that appear in its bilocal decomposition. We study different classes of partially local boxes and find MWN for each class, using Linear Programming. We identify also the wirings which lead to MWN and exhibit that some of them can serve as a witness of certain classes. We conclude with example of partially local boxes being analogue of quantum states that allow to distribute entanglement in separable manner.

abstract: We introduce the concept of the Bell transform to represent known quantum gates in the literature, which are a unitary basis transformation from the product basis to the Bell states or the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. The algebraic structure of the four dimensional Bell transform has been studied systematically in this paper and we point out that it may be not a Clifford gate. The representative examples of the four dimensional Bell transform are verified as maximally entangling Clifford gates and some of them are recognized as parity-preserving gates or matchgates or Yang--Baxter gates. We define the teleportation operator in terms of the four dimensional Bell transform and apply it to the reformulation of the fault-tolerant construction of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates in teleportation-based quantum computation. The algebraic structure of the higher dimensional Bell transform is also included and representative examples for it are verified as multi-qubit Clifford gates. Our research suggests that the Bell transform may play important roles in quantum information and computation as a new type of quantum transform.

abstract: Lee-Goldburg cross polarization is used in many NMR experiments to determine internuclear distances. Distances calculated from frequency peaks in the dipolar coupled dimension are subject to scale factors. Experimentally determined scale factors can differ significantly from the theoreticalyy useful value described in the literature. In this work, simulations using SPINEVOLUTION explore effects of varying experimental parameters of frequency offset and cross polarization powers on $^{15}$N-H systems. Experimental data is used to corroborate the simulation. The scale factor is shown not only to depend on the offset frequency but also the cross polarization powers of the observed nucleus. Scale factors greater than one are shown to be possible in simulated data, though such factors obscure the determination of internuclear distances.

abstract: Correlations in Bell and noncontextuality inequalities can be expressed as a positive linear combination of probabilities of events. Exclusive events can be represented as adjacent vertices of a graph, so correlations can be associated to a subgraph. We show that the maximum value of the correlations for classical, quantum, and more general theories is the independence number, the Lov\'asz number, and the fractional packing number of this subgraph, respectively. We also show that, for any graph, there is always a correlation experiment such that the set of quantum probabilities is exactly the Gr\"otschel-Lov\'asz-Schrijver theta body. This identifies these combinatorial notions as fundamental physical objects and provides a method for singling out experiments with quantum correlations on demand.

While raising questions about "how quantum" the D-Wave machine is, the new model also provides additional algorithmic insights into the nature of the native computational problem solved by the D-Wave machine.

abstract: Harnessing non-abelian statistics of anyons to perform quantum computational tasks is getting closer to reality. While the existence of universal anyons by braiding alone such as the Fibonacci anyon is theoretically a possibility, accessible anyons with current technology all belong to a class that is called weakly integral---anyons whose squared quantum dimensions are integers. We analyze the computational power of the first non-abelian anyon system with only integral quantum dimensions---$D(S_3)$, the quantum double of $S_3$. Since all anyons in $D(S_3)$ have finite images of braid group representations, they cannot be universal for quantum computation by braiding alone. Based on our knowledge of the images of the braid group representations, we set up three qutrit computational models. Supplementing braidings with some measurements and ancillary states, we find a universal gate set for each model.

The inferred photon click statistics exhibit excellent agreements to the theoretical predictions. From our measurement results we conclude that our source meets the requirements to avert photon-number-splitting attacks.

As quantum entanglement is a property of states independent of classical distances, the notion of space and time has to be revised to represent the holistic interconnection of quanta. We also speculate about various forms of reprogramming, or reconfiguring, the propagation of information for multipartite statistics and in quantum field theory.

abstract: Over the last 10 years there has been an explosion of "operational reconstructions" of quantum theory. This is great stuff: For, through it, we come to see the myriad ways in which the quantum formalism can be chopped into primitives and, through clever toil, brought back together to form a smooth whole. An image of an IQ-Block puzzle comes to mind, this http URL There is no doubt that this is invaluable work, particularly for our understanding of the intricate connections between so many quantum information protocols. But to me, it seems to miss the mark for an ultimate understanding of quantum theory; I am left hungry. I still want to know what strange property of matter forces this formalism upon our information accounting. To play on something Einstein once wrote to Max Born, "The quantum reconstructions are certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that they are not yet the real thing. The reconstructions say a lot, but do not really bring us any closer to the secret of the `old one'." In this talk, I hope to expand on these points and convey some sense of why I am fascinated with the problem of the symmetric informationally complete POVMs to an extent greater than axiomatic reconstructions.

The probability of obtaining this assignment at the end of the quantum evolution measures the success of the algorithm. Here we report three strategies which consistently increase the success probability for the hardest instances in our ensemble: decreasing the overall evolution time, initializing the system in excited states, and adding a random local Hamiltonian to the middle of the evolution.

abstract: We study the stochastic dynamics of a two-level quantum system interacting with a stochastic magnetic field, and a single frequency electromagnetic field, with and without making the rotating wave approximation (RWA). The transformation to the rotating frame does not commute with the stochastic Hamiltonian if the stochastic field has nonvanishing components in the transverse direction. Hence, making the RWA modifies the stochastic terms in the Hamiltonian. Modification of the decay terms is also required in a master equation approach (i.e., the Liouville--von Neumann density matrix equation) for describing the dynamics. For isotropic Gaussian white noise, the RWA dynamics remains Markovian, although the Lindblad terms in the master equation for the density matrix become time-dependent when the non-commutation of the RWA transformation and the noise Hamiltonian is properly accounted for. We also treat Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noise, and find, in contra-distinction to the white noise case, a significant difference in the dynamics calculated with the RWA when the non-commutation of the RWA transformation and the noise Hamiltonian is taken into account. These findings are applicable to the modeling of any open quantum system coupled to an electromagentic field.

abstract: We propose a scheme generating robust squeezed light by using double cavity optomechanical system driven by a blue detuned laser in one cavity and by a red detuned laser in the other. This double cavity system is shown to mimic effectively an interaction that is similar to the one for the downconverter, which is known to be a source of strong squeezing for the light fields. There are however distinctions as the phonons, which lead to such an interaction, can contribute to the quantum noise. We show that the squeezing of the output fields in the order of $10$dB can be achieved even at the mirror temperature at the order of $10$mK.

This picture predicts a precise relation between their temporal and transverse spatial separations at the crystal output. The space-time coupling described by classical arguments turns out to determine in a precise way the spatio-temporal structure of the quantum entanglement, analysed by means of the biphotonic correlation and of the Schmidt dimensionality of the entanglement.

The spectrum seems to present avoiding crossings for all valid parameter sets and, thus, may be integrable. For a degenerate qubit, the model is soluble and we construct an unbroken supersymmetric parter for it. We discuss the classical simulation of the general model in photonic lattices and show that it presents quasi-periodic reconstruction for a given initial state and parameter set.

abstract: The major resolution-limiting factor in cryoelectron microscopy of unstained biological specimens is radiation damage by the very electrons that are used to probe the specimen structure. To address this problem, an electron microscopy scheme that employs quantum entanglement to enable phase measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limit has recently been proposed {[}Phys. Rev. A \textbf{85}, 043810{]}. Here we identify and examine in detail measurement errors that will arise in the scheme. An emphasis is given to considerations concerning inelastic scattering events because in general schemes assisted with quantum entanglement are known to be highly vulnerable to lossy processes. We find that the amount of error due both to elastic and inelastic scattering processes are acceptable provided that the electron beam geometry is properly designed.

abstract: We present a method of developing analytical measures of $k$-partite delocalization in arbitrary $n$-body W-like states, otherwise known as mixed states in the single excitation subspace. These measures calculate the distance of a state to its closest reference state with $k-1$ entanglement. We find that the reference state is determined by the purity of the state undergoing measurement. Measures with up to 6-body delocalization for a 6-body system are derived in full, while an algorithm for general $k$-partite measures is given.

abstract: We introduce the concept of boundariness capturing the most efficient way of expressing a given element of a convex set as a probability mixture of its boundary elements. In other words, this number measures (without the need of any explicit topology) how far the given element is from the boundary. It is shown that one of the elements from the boundary can be always chosen to be an extremal element. We focus on evaluation of this quantity for quantum sets of states, channels and observables. We show that boundariness is intimately related to (semi)norms that provide an operational interpretation of this quantity. In particular, the minimum error probability for discrimination of a pair of quantum devices is lower bounded by the boundariness of each of them. We proved that for states and observables this bound is saturated and conjectured this feature for channels. The boundariness is zero for infinite-dimensional quantum objects as in this case all the elements are boundary elements.

abstract: We report the first entanglement generation experiment using an on-chip slow light device. With highly efficient spontaneous four-wave mixing enhanced by the slow light effect in a coupled resonator optical waveguide based on a silicon photonic crystal, we generated 1.5-$\mu$m-band high-dimensional time-bin entangled photon pairs. We undertook two-photon interference experiments and observed the coincidence fringes with visibilities $>74\%$. The present result enables us to realize an on-chip entanglement source with a very small footprint, which is an essential function for quantum information processing based on integrated quantum photonics.

abstract: We study a system of two bosonic fields subject to two-mode squeezing in the presence of dissipation. We find the Lie algebra governing the dynamics of the problem and use the Wei-Norman method to determine the solutions. Using this scheme we arrive at a closed form expression for an infinitely dimensional density operator which we use to calculate the degree of entanglement (quantified by Horodeckis' negativity) between the modes. We compare our result to the known continuous variable entanglement measures. We analyse the conditions for entanglement generation and the influence of thermal environments on the state formed. The problem is relevant, in particular, for understanding of quantum dynamics of coupled optical and/or mechanical modes in optomechanical and nanomechanical systems.

abstract: Quantum state tomography suffers from the measurement effort increasing exponentially with the number of qubits. Here, we demonstrate permutationally invariant tomography for which, contrary to conventional tomography, all resources scale polynomially with the number of qubits both in terms of the measurement effort as well as the computational power needed to process and store the recorded data. We demonstrate the benefits of combining permutationally invariant tomography with compressed sensing by studying the influence of the pump power on the noise present in a six-qubit symmetric Dicke state, a case where full tomography is possible only for very high pump powers.

abstract: The strong system-bath correlation is a typical initial condition in many condensed matter and some quantum optical systems. Here, the dynamics of a spin interacting with a spin bath through an intermediate spin are studied. Initial correlations between the spin and the intermediate spin are taken into account. The exact analytical expression for the evolution operator of the spin is found. Furthermore, correlated projection superoperator techniques are applied to the model and a time-convolutionless master equation to second order is derived. It is shown that the time-convolutionless master equation to second order reproduces the exact dynamics for time-scales of the order 1/{\gamma}, where {\gamma} is the coupling of the central spin to the intermediate spin. It is found that there is a strong dependence on the initial system-bath correlations in the dynamics of the reduced system, which cannot be neglected.

abstract: A model of an arbitrary spin coupled to a bath of spins 1/2 in a star configuration is considered. The exact reduced dynamics of the central spin is found for the case of non-correlated initial conditions of the system and the bath. The exact solution is used to test two approximation techniques, namely, the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator technique and the time-convolutionless projection operator technique corresponding to the second order of the coupling constant. Two types of projection operators are used for deriving the master equations and the results are compared with the exact solution for a central spin equal to one. It is shown that the approximate master equations reproduce the exact dynamics on time-scales $1/(A\sqrt{N})$, where A is the coupling constant and N is the number of spins in the bath.

abstract: This paper develops a distributional theory for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation with point interactions in $d=1$ and surface interactions in $d>1$. Currently, there is no generally accepted method whereby singular potentials can be translated into a set of boundary conditions, and vice versa. We aim to fill that void. We make three contributions for point interactions in one dimension. First, we derive the boundary conditions corresponding to the potential $\delta^{(n)}(x)$. Second, we establish the correspondence between point potentials and self-adjoint extensions. Third, we derive in closed form the propagator corresponding to the $\delta^{(1)}(x)$-potential, thereby resolving a longstanding paradox. In higher dimensions, analogously, we establish the correspondence between surface potentials and self-adjoint extensions, and we derive the exact propagator corresponding to a dipole interaction on a flat surface.

abstract: In this paper we apply the formalism of translation invariant (continuous) matrix product states in the thermodynamic limit to $(1+1)$ dimensional critical models. Finite bond dimension bounds the entanglement entropy and introduces an effective finite correlation length, so that the state is perturbed away from criticality. The assumption that the scaling hypothesis holds for this kind of perturbation is known in the literature as finite entanglement scaling. We provide further evidence for the validity of finite entanglement scaling and based on this formulate a scaling algorithm to estimate the central charge and critical exponents of the conformally invariant field theories describing the critical models under investigation. The algorithm is applied to three exemplary models; the cMPS version to the non-relativistic Lieb-Liniger model and the relativistic massless boson, and MPS version to the one-dimensional quantum Ising model at the critical point. Another new aspect to our approach is that we directly use the (c)MPS induced correlation length rather than the bond dimension as scaling parameter. This choice is motivated by several theoretical arguments as well as by the remarkable accuracy of our results.

abstract: We consider the multiple hypothesis testing problem for symmetric quantum state discrimination between r given states \sigma_1,...,\sigma_r. By splitting up the overall test into multiple binary tests in various ways we obtain a number of upper bounds on the optimal error probability in terms of the binary error probabilities. These upper bounds allow us to deduce various bounds on the asymptotic error rate, for which it has been hypothesised that it is given by the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound (or Chernoff divergence) C(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_r), as recently introduced by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a in analogy with Salikhov's classical multi-hypothesis Chernoff bound. This quantity is defined as the minimum of the pairwise binary Chernoff divergences min_{j<k}C(\sigma_j,\sigma_k). It was known already that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between C/3 and C, and that for certain classes of sets of states the bound is actually achieved. It was known to be achieved, in particular, when the state pair that is closest together in Chernoff divergence is more than 6 times closer than the next closest pair. Our results improve on this in two ways. Firstly, we show that the optimal asymptotic rate must lie between C/2 and C. Secondly, we show that the Chernoff bound is already achieved when the closest state pair is more than 2 times closer than the next closest pair. We also show that the Chernoff bound is achieved when at least $r-2$ of the states are pure, improving on a previous result by Nussbaum and Szko{\l}a. Finally, we indicate a number of potential pathways along which a proof (or disproof) may eventually be found that the multi-hypothesis quantum Chernoff bound is always achieved.

abstract: We develop an open-system dynamical theory of the Casimir interaction between coherent atomic waves and a material surface. The system --- the external atomic waves --- disturbs the environment --- the electromagnetic field and the atomic dipole degrees of freedom --- in a non- local manner by leaving footprints on distinct paths of the atom interferometer. This induces a non-local dynamical phase depending simultaneously on two distinct paths, beyond usual atom-optics methods, and comparable to the local dynamical phase corrections. Non-local and local atomic phase coherences are thus equally important to capture the interplay between the external atomic motion and the Casimir interaction. Such dynamical phases are obtained for finite-width wavepackets by developing a diagrammatic expansion of the disturbed environment quantum state.

abstract: The phenomena of particle mixing and flavor oscillations in elementary particle physics can be addressed by the point of view of quantum information theory, and described in terms of multi-mode entanglement of single-particle states. In this paper we show that such a description can be extended to the domain of quantum field theory, where we uncover a fine structure of quantum correlations associated with multi-mode, multi-particle entanglement. By means of an entanglement measure based on the linear entropies associated with all the possible bipartitions, we analyze the entanglement in the states of flavor neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. Remarkably, we show that the entanglement is connected with experimentally measurable quantities, i.e. the variances of the lepton numbers and charges.

abstract: We present an efficient method to extract the amount of true randomness that can be obtained by a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG). By repeating the measurements of a quantum system and by swapping between two mutually unbiased bases, a lower bound of the achievable true randomness can be evaluated. The bound is obtained thanks to the uncertainty principle of complementary measurements applied to min- and max- entropies. We tested our method with two different QRNGs, using a train of qubits or ququart, demonstrating the scalability toward practical applications.

Each of cavities is doped with a semiconductor quantum dot. By the dynamics, the excitonic modes of quantum dots are enabled to exhibit entan-gled coherent GHZ and W states. Apart from the exciton losses, the master equation approach shows that when the populations of the field modes in the cavities are negli-gible the destruction of entanglement due to decoherence arises from photon losses, is effectively suppressed.

We also show that there exist p-qubit UPBs of almost all sizes less than $2^p$.

abstract: A quantum memory at microwave frequencies, able to store the state of multiple superconducting qubits for long times, is a key element for quantum information processing. Electronic and nuclear spins are natural candidates for the storage medium as their coherence time can be well above one second. Benefiting from these long coherence times requires to apply the refocusing techniques used in magnetic resonance, a major challenge in the context of hybrid quantum circuits. Here we report the first implementation of such a scheme, using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond coupled to a superconducting resonator, in a setup compatible with superconducting qubit technology. We implement the active reset of the NV spins into their ground state by optical pumping and their refocusing by Hahn echo sequences. This enables the storage of multiple microwave pulses at the picoWatt level and their retrieval after up to $35 \mu$s, a three orders of magnitude improvement compared to previous experiments.

abstract: As the current revolution in communication is underway, quantum teleportation can increase the level of security in quantum communication applications. In this paper, we present a quantum teleportation procedure that capable to teleport either accelerated or non-accelerated information through different quantum channels. These quantum chan- nels are based on accelerated multi-qubit states, where each qubit of each of these channels represent a partner. Namely, these states are the the W state, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and the GHZ-like state. Here, we show that the fidelity of teleporting acceler- ated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non-accelerated information, both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state. Also, the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that the degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel, type of the measurement, and value of the acceleration. The result of comparison concludes that teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is more robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the other two states. For future work, the proposed procedure can be generalized later to achieve communication through a wider quantum network.

abstract: The status of the quantum state is perhaps the most controversial issue in the foundations of quantum theory. Is it an epistemic state (state of knowledge) or an ontic state (state of reality)? In realist models of quantum theory, the epistemic view asserts that nonorthogonal quantum states correspond to overlapping probability measures over the true ontic states. This naturally accounts for a large number of otherwise puzzling quantum phenomena. For example, the indistinguishability of nonorthogonal states is explained by the fact that the ontic state sometimes lies in the overlap region, in which case there is nothing in reality that could distinguish the two states. For this to work, the amount of overlap of the probability measures should be comparable to the indistinguishability of the quantum states. In this letter, I exhibit a family of states for which the ratio of these two quantities must be $\leq 2de^{-cd}$ in Hilbert spaces of dimension $d$ that are divisible by $4$. This implies that, for large Hilbert space dimension, the epistemic explanation of indistinguishability becomes implausible at an exponential rate as the Hilbert space dimension increases.

abstract: When studying thermalization of quantum systems, it is typical to ask whether a system interacting with an environment will evolve towards a local thermal state. Here, we show that a more general and relevant question is "when does a system thermalize relative to a particular reference?" By relative thermalization we mean that, as well as being in a local thermal state, the system is uncorrelated with the reference. We argue that this is necessary in order to apply standard statistical mechanics to the study of the interaction between a thermalized system and a reference. We then derive a condition for relative thermalization of quantum systems interacting with an arbitrary environment. This condition has two components: the first is state-independent, reflecting the structure of invariant subspaces, like energy shells, and the relative sizes of system and environment; the second depends on the initial correlations between reference, system and environment, measured in terms of conditional entropies. Intuitively, a small system interacting with a large environment is likely to thermalize relative to a reference, but only if, initially, the reference was not highly correlated with the system and environment. Our statement makes this intuition precise, and we show that in many natural settings this thermalization condition is approximately tight. Established results on thermalization, which usually ignore the reference, follow as special cases of our statements.

authors: Hauke Traulsen
comments: 7 pages, 9 figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8000
abstract: In this article, a procedure called Probabilistic Swapped-Bell-States Analysis (PSBA) is proposed. Using this procedure two communication partners can transmit (binary-encoded) information over large spatial distances. This procedure is unusual insofar as no classical communication channels are used either during or after information encoding. To make this possible, entanglement swapping is used as a transport channel. The encoding of bits is realized by the execution (or non-execution, as the case may be) of entanglement swapping on multiple photon pairs, while decoding is realized by a statistical detection of swapped entanglements. If the PSBA procedure sustains itself against a rebuttal by the scientific community, it would constitute a technical approach for transmitting information faster than light. The PSBA procedure seems to be in harmony with the no-communication theorem, since PSBA does not manipulate (and teleport) specific states from one (entangled) particle to another in order to communicate, but instead uses statistics on entanglement swappings for information encoding.

abstract: Some two qubit interactions are singly sufficient for universal quantum computation but not without the use of an ancilla. Recent schemes for universal quantum computation have focused on hybrid physical systems using ancillae. In them, the application of resources is shifted to the ancilla system. We consider which 2-qubit interactions are universal in ancilla schemes where direct connections between main register qubits are forbidden. By the use of ancilla driven operations and repeat-until-success style random gates, a single fixed symmetric gate can be universal be control of the number of repetitions alone.

abstract: Combining the WKB expansion at large distances and Perturbation Theory at small distances it is constructed a compact uniform approximation for eight low-lying eigenfunctions: with the quantum numbers $(n,m,\Lambda,\pm)$ , where $n=m=0$ at $\Lambda=0,1,2$, and $n=1$, $m=0$ at $\Lambda=0$. For any of these states this approximation provides the relative accuracy $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ (not less than 5 s.d.) for any real $x$ in eigenfunctions and for total energy $E(R)$ it gives 10-11 s.d. for internuclear distances $R \in [0,50]$. Corrections to proposed approximation are evaluated systematically in a framework of the convergent perturbation theory. Separation constants are found with 8 s.d. The oscillator strength for the electric dipole transitions are accurately calculated and compared with existing data with coincidence on the level of 7 s.d. The magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transitions are accurately calculated for the first time with not less than 7 s.d.

Let $|V_0|$ be the height (depth) of the barrier (well) then for a fixed geometry of the potential, we show that in the double-well, $E=V_0(>0)$, and in the hole potential ($V_0 <0$), $E=0$, can be energy eigenvalues provided $V_0$ admits some special discrete values. These states have been missed out earlier which emerge only when one seeks the special zero-energy solution of one-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger equation as $\psi(x)=Bx+C$.

abstract: Among the applications of optical phase measurement, the differential interference contrast microscope is widely used for the evaluation of opaque materials or biological tissues. However, the signal to noise ratio for a given light intensity is limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL), which is critical for the measurements where the probe light intensity is limited to avoid damaging the sample. The SQL can only be beaten by using {\it N} quantum correlated particles, with an improvement factor of $\sqrt{N}$. Here we report the first demonstration of an entanglement-enhanced microscope, which is a confocal-type differential interference contrast microscope where an entangled photon pair ({\it N}=2) source is used for illumination. An image of a Q shape carved in relief on the glass surface is obtained with better visibility than with a classical light source. The signal to noise ratio is 1.35$\pm$0.12 times better than that limited by the SQL.

abstract: It is usually assumed that a quantum computation is performed by applying gates in a specific order. One can relax this assumption by allowing a control quantum system to switch the order in which the gates are applied. This provides a more general kind of quantum computing, that allows transformations on blackbox quantum gates that are impossible in a circuit with fixed order. Here we show that this model of quantum computing is physically realizable, by proposing an interferometric setup that can implement such a quantum control of the order between the gates. We show that this new resource provides a reduction in computational complexity: we propose a problem that can be solved using $O(n)$ blackbox queries, whereas the best known quantum algorithm with fixed order between the gates requires $O(n^2)$ queries. Furthermore, we conjecture that solving this problem in a classical computer takes exponential time, which may be of independent interest.

abstract: We present setups for the practical realization of adding control to unknown subroutines, supplementing the existing quantum optical scheme for black-box control with a counterpart for the quantum control of the ordering of sequences of operations. We also provide schemes to realize either task using trapped ions. These practical circumventions of recent no-go theorems are based on existing technologies. We argue that the possibility to add control to unknown operations in practice is a common feature of many physical systems. Based on the proposed implementations we discuss the apparent contradictions between theory and practice.

abstract: The van der Waals interaction between two polarizable atoms is considered. In three dimensions the standard form with an attractive $1/|R|^6$ potential is obtained from second-order quantum perturbation theory. When the electron motion is restricted to lower dimensions (but the $1/|R|$ Coulomb potential is retained), new terms in the expansion appear and alter both the sign and the $|R|$ dependence of the interaction.

abstract: Acin et al. introduced a unified framework for the study of no-signalling correlations. Such a framework is based on the notion of local quantum measurements, but, in order to account for beyond-quantum correlations, global pseudo-states that are not positive semidefinite are allowed. After a short review of the formalism, we consider its use in the quantification of both general non-local and beyond-quantum correlations. We argue that the unified framework for correlations provides a simple approach to such a quantification, in particular when the quantification is meant to be operational and meaningful in a resource-theory scenario, i.e., when considering the processing of resources by means of non-resources. We relate different notions of robustness of correlations, both at the level of (pseudo-)states and abstract probability distributions, with particular focus on the beyond-quantum robustness of correlations and pseudo-states. We revisit known results and argue that, within the unified framework, the relation between the two levels---that of operators and that of probability distributions---is very strict. We point out how the consideration of robustness at the two levels leads to a natural framework for the quantification of entanglement in a device-independent way. Finally, we show that the beyond-quantum robustness of the non-positive operators needed to achieve beyond-quantum correlations coincides with their negativity and their distance from the set of quantum states. As an example, we calculate the beyond-quantum robustness for the case of a noisy Popescu-Rohrlich box.

Also, the post-selection probability of NOON states is shown to be higher.

abstract: When two chains of quantum systems are driven at their ends by a two-mode squeezed reservoir, they approach a steady state characterized by the formation of many entangled pairs. Each pair is made of one element of the first and one of the second chain. This effect has been already predicted under the assumption of broadband squeezing. Here we investigate the situation of finite-bandwidth reservoirs. This is done by modeling the driving bath as the output field of a non-degenerate parametric oscillator. The resulting non-Markovian dynamics is studied within the theoretical framework of cascade open quantum systems. It is shown that the formation of pair-entangled structures occurs as long as the normal-mode splitting of the arrays does not overcome the squeezing bandwidth of the reservoir.

abstract: The presence of quantum correlations in a quantum state is related to the state response to local unitary perturbations. Such response is quantified by the distance between the unperturbed and perturbed states, minimized with respect to suitably identified sets of local unitary operations. In order to be a bona fide measure of quantum correlations, the distance function must be chosen among those that are contractive under completely positive and trace preserving maps. The most relevant instances of such physically well behaved metrics include the trace, the Bures, and the Hellinger distance. To each of these metrics one can associate the corresponding discord of response, namely the trace, or Hellinger, or Bures minimum distance from the set of unitarily perturbed states. All these three discords of response satisfy the basic axioms for a proper measure of quantum correlations. In the present work we focus in particular on the Bures distance, which enjoys the unique property of being both Riemannian and contractive under completely positive and trace preserving maps, and admits important operational interpretations in terms of state distinguishability. We compute analytically the Bures discord of response for two-qubit states with maximally mixed marginals and we compare it with the corresponding Bures geometric discord, namely the geometric measure of quantum correlations defined as the Bures distance from the set of classically correlated quantum states. Finally, we investigate and identify the maximally quantum correlated two-qubit states according to the Bures discord of response. These states exhibit a remarkable nonlinear dependence on the global state purity.

abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that two commonly used phenomenological post-Markovian quantum master equations can be derived without using any perturbative approximation. A system coupled to an environment characterized by self-classical configurational fluctuations, the latter obeying a Markovian dynamics, defines the underlying physical model. Both Shabani-Lidar equation [A. Shabani and D. A. Lidar, Phys. Rev. A 71, 020101(R) (2005)] and its associated approximated integro-differential kernel master equation are obtained by tracing out two different bipartite Markovian Lindblad dynamics where the environment fluctuations are taken into account by an ancilla system. Furthermore, conditions under which the non-Markovian system dynamics can be unravelled in terms of an ensemble of measurement trajectories are found. In addition, a non-Markovian quantum jump approach is formulated. Contrary to recent analysis [L. Mazzola, E. M. Laine, H. P. Breuer, S. Maniscalco, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. A 81, 062120 (2010)], we also demonstrate that these master equations, even with exponential memory functions, may lead to non-Markovian effects such as an environment-to-system backflow of information if the Hamiltonian system does not commutate with the dissipative dynamics.

abstract: We study the entanglement of magnetic impurities in an environment of electrons through successive scattering while an external magnetic field is applied. We show that the dynamics of the problem can be approximately described by a reduced model of three interacting spins, which reveals an intuitive view on how spins can be entangled by controlled electron scattering. The role of the magnetic field is rather crucial. Depending on the initial state configuration, the magnetic field can either increase or decrease the resulting entanglement but more importantly it can allow the impurities to be maximally entangled.

abstract: High harmonic light sources make it possible to access attosecond time-scales, thus opening up the prospect of manipulating electronic wave packets for steering molecular dynamics. However, two decades after the birth of attosecond physics, the concept of attosecond chemistry has not yet been realized. This is because excitation and manipulation of molecular orbitals requires precisely controlled attosecond waveforms in the deep ultraviolet, which have not yet been synthesized. Here, we present a novel approach using attosecond vacuum ultraviolet pulse-trains to coherently excite and control the outcome of a simple chemical reaction in a deuterium molecule in a non-Born Oppenheimer regime. By controlling the interfering pathways of electron wave packets in the excited neutral and singly-ionized molecule, we unambiguously show that we can switch the excited electronic state on attosecond timescales, coherently guide the nuclear wave packets to dictate the way a neutral molecule vibrates, and steer and manipulate the ionization and dissociation channels. Furthermore, through advanced theory, we succeed in rigorously modeling multi-scale electron and nuclear quantum control in a molecule for the first time. The observed richness and complexity of the dynamics, even in this very simplest of molecules, is both remarkable and daunting, and presents intriguing new possibilities for bridging the gap between attosecond physics and attochemistry.

abstract: A spin-orbit qubit is a hybrid qubit that contains both orbital and spin degrees of freedom of an electron in a quantum dot. Here we study the exchange coupling between two spin-orbit qubits in a nanowire double quantum dot (DQD) with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We find that while the total tunneling in the DQD is irrelevant to the SOC, both the spin-conserved and spin-flipped tunnelings are SOC dependent and can compete with each other in the strong SOC regime. Moreover, the Coulomb repulsion between electrons can combine with the SOC-dependent tunnelings to yield an anisotropic exchange coupling between the two spin-orbit qubits. Also, we give an explicit physical mechanism for this anisotropic exchange coupling.

This work gives the number $N_{\hat{m},\hat{n}}(U)$ as a function of $U$. Here a rotation means an element $D$ of the special orthogonal group ${\rm SO}(3)$ or an element of the special unitary group ${\rm SU}(2)$ that corresponds to $D$. Decompositions of $U$ attaining the minimum number $N_{\hat{m},\hat{n}}(U)$ are also given explicitly.

abstract: We propose a twisted Szegedy walk for estimating the limit behavior of a discrete-time quantum walk on a crystal lattice, an infinite abelian covering graph, whose notion was introduced by [14]. First, we show that the spectrum of the twisted Szegedy walk on the quotient graph can be expressed by mapping the spectrum of a twisted random walk onto the unit circle. Secondly, we show that the spatial Fourier transform of the twisted Szegedy walk on a finite graph with appropriate parameters becomes the Grover walk on its infinite abelian covering graph. Finally, as an application, we show that if the Betti number of the quotient graph is strictly greater than one, then localization is ensured with some appropriated initial state. We also compute the limit density function for the Grover walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with flip flop shift, which implies the coexistence of linear spreading and localization. We partially obtain the abstractive shape of the limit density function: the support is within the $d$-dimensional sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{d}$, and $2^d$ singular points reside on the sphere's surface.

abstract: Weak measurements have recently allowed for the observation of the spin-Hall effect of light in reflection or transmission, which is a spin-dependent light beam shift orthogonal to the plane of incidence. We report here the observation of the Imbert-Fedorov shift via a weak value amplification scheme. The Imbert-Fedorov effect does not depend on the spin of the incident photon only, but it has richer polarization dependence. We prove that weak measurements allow for a complete experimental characterization of the polarization properties of this tiny optical effect.

The gate we obtain is a braid for the usual qutrit $2222$ but with respect to a different basis. With respect to that basis, the Freedman group of \cite{LEV} is identical to the $D$-group $D(18,1,1;2,1,1)$. We give a physical interpretation for each Blichfeld generator of the group $D(18,1,1;2,1,1)$. Inspired by these new techniques for the qutrit, we are able to make new ancillas, namely $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1>\,+|3>)$ and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1>\,-|3>)$, for the qubit $1221$.

abstract: We introduce a series of quantities which characterizes a given local operator in conformal field theories from the viewpoint of quantum entanglement. It is defined by the increased amount of (Renyi) entanglement entropy at late time for an excited state defined by acting the local operator on the vacuum. We consider a conformal field theory on an infinite space and take the subsystem in the definition of the entanglement entropy to be its half. We calculate these quantities for a free massless scalar field theory in 2, 4 and 6 dimensions. We find that these results are interpreted in terms of quantum entanglement of finite number states, including EPR states. They agree with a heuristic picture of propagations of entangled particles.

abstract: We study the evolution of correlations in a quasi-2D dipolar gas driven out-of-equilibrium by a sudden ramp of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong ramps, the momentum distribution, excited fraction and density-density correlation function all display pronounced features that are directly related to the appearance of a roton minimum in the underlying spectrum. Our study suggests that the evolution of correlations following a quench can be used as a probe of roton-like excitations in a dipolar gas. We also find that the build up of density-density correlations following a quench occurs much more slowly in the dipolar gas compared to a non-dipolar gas, owing to the long-range interactions.

abstract: Good clocks are of importance both to fundamental physics and for applications in astronomy, metrology and global positioning systems. In a recent technological breakthrough, researchers at NIST have been able to achieve a stability of 1 part in $10^{18}$ using an Ytterbium clock. This naturally raises the question of whether there are fundamental limits to the stability of clocks. In this paper we point out that gravity and quantum mechanics set a fundamental limit on the stability of clocks. This limit comes from a combination of the uncertainty relation, the gravitational redshift and the relativistic time dilation effect. For example, a single ion hydrogen maser clock in a terrestrial gravitational field cannot achieve a stability better than one part in $10^{22}$. This observation has implications for laboratory experiments involving both gravity and quantum theory.

abstract: Several years ago we demonstrated that the Casimir energy for perfectly reflecting and imperfectly reflecting parallel plates gravitated normally, that is, obeyed the equivalence principle. At that time the divergences in the theory were treated only formally, without proper regularization, and the coupling to gravity was limited to the canonical energy-momentum-stress tensor. Here we strengthen the result by removing both of those limitations. We consider, as a toy model, massless scalar fields interacting with semitransparent ($\delta$-function) potentials defining parallel plates, which become Dirichlet plates for strong coupling. We insert space and time point-split regulation parameters, and obtain well-defined contributions to the self- energy of each plate, and the interaction energy between the plates. (This self-energy does not vanish even in the conformally-coupled, strong-coupled limit.) We also compute the local energy density, which requires regularization near the plates. In general, the energy density includes a surface energy that resides precisely on the boundaries. This energy is also regulated. The gravitational interaction of this well-defined system is then investigated, and it is verified that the equivalence principle is satisfied.

abstract: We derive the statistics of scattered photons from a $\Lambda$- or ladder-type three-level emitter (3LE) embedded in a 1D open waveguide. The weak probe photons in the waveguide are coupled to one of the two allowed transitions of the 3LE, and the other transition is driven by a control beam. This system shows electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) which is accompanied with the Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) at a strong driving by the control beam, and some of these effects have been observed recently. We show that the nature of second-order coherence of the transmitted probe photons near two-photon resonance changes from bunching to antibunching to constant as strength of the control beam is ramped up from zero to a higher value where the ATS appears.

abstract: We consider a one-dimensional optomechanical lattice where each site is strongly driven by a control laser to enhance the basic optomechanical interaction. We then study the propagation of photons injected by an additional probe laser beam; this is the lattice-generalization of the well-known optomechanically-induced transparency (OMIT) effect in a single optomechanical cavity. We find an interesting interplay between OMIT-type physics and geometric, Fabry-Perot type resonances. In particular, phonon-like polaritons can give rise to high-amplitude transmission resonances which are much narrower than the scale set by internal photon losses. We also find that the local photon density of states in the lattice exhibits OMIT-style interference features. It is thus far richer than would be expected by just looking at the band structure of the dissipation-free coherent system.

abstract: A new variational method, the principle of least radix economy, is formulated. The mathematical and physical relevance of the radix economy, also called digit capacity, is established, showing how physical laws can be derived from this concept in a unified way. The principle reinterprets and generalizes the principle of least action yielding two classes of physical solutions: least action paths and quantum wavefunctions. A new physical foundation of the Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is then accomplished and it is used to derive the Schr\"odinger and Dirac equations and the breaking of the commutativity of spacetime geometry. The formulation provides an explanation of how determinism and random statistical behavior coexist in spacetime and a framework is developed that allows dynamical processes to be formulated in terms of chains of digits. These methods lead to a new (pre-geometrical) foundation for Lorentz transformations and special relativity. The Parker-Rhodes combinatorial hierarchy is encompassed within our approach and this leads to an estimate of the interaction strength of the electromagnetic and gravitational forces that agrees with the experimental values to an error of less than one thousandth. Finally, it is shown how the principle of least-radix economy naturally gives rise to Boltzmann's principle of classical statistical thermodynamics. A new expression for a general (path-dependent) nonequilibrium entropy is proposed satisfying the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

abstract: We consider the string-net model on the honeycomb lattice for Ising anyons in the presence of a string tension. This competing term induces a nontrivial dynamics of the non-Abelian anyonic quasiparticles and may lead to a breakdown of the topological phase. Using high-order series expansions and exact diagonalizations, we determine the robustness of this doubled Ising phase which is found to be separated from two gapped phases. An effective quantum dimer model emerges in the large tension limit giving rise to two different translation symmetry-broken phases. Consequently, we obtain four transition points, two of which are associated with first-order transitions whereas the two others are found to be continuous and provide examples of recently proposed Bose condensation for anyons.

abstract: We consider the time evolution following a quantum quench in spin-1/2 chains. It is well known that local conservation laws constrain the dynamics and, eventually, the stationary behavior of local observables. We show that some widely studied models, like the quantum XY model, possess extra families of local conservation laws in addition to the translation invariant ones. As a consequence, the additional charges must be included in the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the stationary properties. The effects go well beyond a simple redefinition of the stationary state. The time evolution of a non-translation invariant state under a (translation invariant) Hamiltonian with a perturbation that weakly breaks the hidden symmetries underlying the extra conservation laws exhibits pre-relaxation. In addition, in the limit of small perturbation, the time evolution following pre-relaxation can be described by means of a time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble.

In particular, we show that a two-dimensional Hamiltonian system is completely integrable, if the Hamiltonian has the form $H=T+V$ where $V$ and $T$ are respectively harmonic functions of the generalized coordinates and the associated momenta.

abstract: Paraxial lens optics is discussed to study the continuity properties of the $ABCD$ beam transfer matrix. The two-by-two matrix for the one-lens camera-like system can be converted to an equi-diagonal form by a scale transformation, leaving the off-diagonal elements invariant. It is shown that the matrix remains continuous during the focusing process, but this transition is not analytic. However, its first derivative is still continuous, which leads to the concept of "tangential continuity." It is then shown that this tangential continuity is applicable to $ABCD$ matrices pertinent to periodic optical systems, where the equi-diagonalization is achieved by a similarity transformation using rotations. It is also noted that both the scale transformations and the rotations can be unified within the framework of Hermitian transformations.

A fractional power-law decaying entropy function is revealed which presents another evidence for the validity of the third law of thermodynamics in the quantum dissipative region. Several non-trivial characters are excavated such as that the entropy varies from a non-linear diverging function to a semi-linear decaying function of the fractional exponent as the temperature tends to absolute zero.

abstract: If quantum gravity does not lead to a breakdown of predictability, then Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski and Sully (AMPS) have argued that an observer falling into a black hole can perform an experiment which verifies a violation of entanglement monogamy - that late time Hawking radiation is maximally entangled with early time Hawking radiation and also with infalling radiation - something impossible in quantum field theory. However, as pointed out by Hayden and Harlow, this experiment is infeasible, as the time required to perform the experiment is almost certainly longer than the lifetime of the black hole. Here we propose an alternative firewall experiment which could actually be performed within the black hole's lifetime. The alternative experiment involves forming an entangled black hole in which the unscrambling of information is precomputed on a quantum memory prior to the creation of the black hole and without acting on the matter which forms the black hole or emerges from it. This would allow an observer near a black hole to signal faster than light. As another application of our precomputing strategy, we show how one can produce entangled black holes which acts like ``flat mirrors'', in the sense that information comes out almost instantly (as in the Hayden-Preskill scenario), but also emerge unscrambled, so that it can actually be observed instantly as well. Finally, we prove that a black hole in thermal equilibrium with its own radiation, is uncorrelated with this radiation.

abstract: Recently, a programmable quantum annealing machine has been built that minimizes the cost function of hard optimization problems by adiabatically quenching quantum fluctuations. Tests performed by different research teams have shown that, indeed, the machine seems to exploit quantum effects. However experiments on a class of random-bond instances have not yet demonstrated an advantage over classical optimization algorithms on traditional computer hardware. Here we present evidence as to why this might be the case. These engineered quantum annealing machines effectively operate coupled to a decohering thermal bath. Therefore, we study the finite-temperature critical behavior of the standard benchmark problem used to assess the computational capabilities of these complex machines. We simulate both random-bond Ising models and spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian disorder on the D-Wave Chimera topology. Our results show that while the worst-case complexity of finding a ground state of an Ising spin glass on the Chimera graph is not polynomial, the finite-temperature phase space is likely rather simple: Spin glasses on Chimera have only a zero-temperature transition. This means that benchmarking optimization methods using spin glasses on the Chimera graph might not be the best benchmark problems to test quantum speedup. We propose alternative benchmarks by embedding potentially harder problems on the Chimera topology. Finally, we also study the (reentrant) disorder-temperature phase diagram of the random-bond Ising model on the Chimera graph and show that a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase is stable up to 19.85(15)% antiferromagnetic bonds. Beyond this threshold the system only displays a zero-temperature spin-glass phase. Our results therefore show that a careful design of the hardware architecture and benchmark problems is key when building quantum annealing machines.

abstract: We investigate experimentally and theoretically the Faraday effect in an atomic medium in the hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, where the Zeeman interaction is larger than the hyperfine splitting. We use a small permanent magnet and a micro-fabricated vapour cell, giving magnetic fields of the order of a Tesla. We show that for low absorption and small rotation angles, the refractive index is well approximated by the Faraday rotation signal, giving a simple way to measure the atomic refractive index. Fitting to the atomic spectra, we achieve magnetic field sensitivity at the $10^{-4}$ level. Finally we note that the Faraday signal shows zero crossings which can be used as temperature insensitive error signals for laser frequency stabilisation at large detuning. The theoretical sensitivity for $^{87}$Rb is found to be $\sim 40$ kHz/$^\circ$C.

abstract: We demonstrate the existence of extremely weakly decaying linear and nonlinear modes (i.e. modes immune to dissipation) in the one-dimensional periodic array of identical spatially localized dissipations, where the dissipation width is much smaller than the period of the array. We consider wave propagation governed by the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation in the array of identical Gaussian-shaped dissipations with three parameters, the integral dissipation strength $\Gamma_0$, the width $\sigma$ and the array period $d$. In the linear case, setting $\sigma\to0$, while keeping $\Gamma_0$ fixed, we get an array of zero-width dissipations given by the Dirac delta-functions, i.e. the complex Kroning-Penney model, where an infinite number of nondecaying modes appear with the Bloch index being either at the center, $k= 0$, or at the boundary, $k= \pi/d $, of an analog of the Brillouin zone. By using numerical simulations we confirm that the weakly decaying modes persist for $\sigma$ such that $\sigma/d\ll1$ and have the same Bloch index. The nondecaying modes persist also if a real-valued periodic potential is added to the spatially periodic array of dissipations, with the period of the dissipative array being multiple of that of the periodic potential. We also consider evolution of the soliton-shaped pulses in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the spatially periodic dissipative lattice and find that when the pulse width is much larger than the lattice period and its wave number $k$ is either at the center, $k= 2\pi/d$, or at the boundary, $k= \pi/d $, a significant fraction of the pulse escapes the dissipation forming a stationary nonlinear mode with the soliton shaped envelope and the Fourier spectrum consisting of two peaks centered at $k $ and $-k$.

abstract: One necessary criterion for the thermalization of a nonequilibrium quantum many-particle system is ergodicity. It is, however, not sufficient in case where the asymptotic long-time state lies in a symmetry-broken phase but the initial state of nonequilibrium time evolution is fully symmetric with respect to this symmetry. In equilibrium one particular symmetry-broken state is chosen due to the presence of an infinitesimal symmetry-breaking perturbation. We study the analogous scenario from a dynamical point of view: Can an infinitesimal symmetry-breaking perturbation be sufficient for the system to establish a nonvanishing order during quantum real-time evolution? We study this question analytically for a minimal model system that can be associated with symmetry breaking, the ferromagnetic Kondo model. We show that after a quantum quench from a completely symmetric state the system is able to break its symmetry dynamically and discuss how these features can be observed experimentally.

abstract: The probability operator is derived from first principles for an equilibrium quantum system. It is also shown that the superposition states collapse into a mixture of states giving the conventional von Neumann trace form for the quantum average. The mechanism for the collapse is found to be quite general: it results from the conservation law for a conserved, exchangeable variable (such as energy) and the entanglement of the total system wave function that necessarily follows. The relevance of the present results to the einselection mechanism for decoherence, to the quantum measurement problem, and to the classical nature of the macroscopic world are discussed.

The method is applicable to cold atom systems as well as solid state setups, both for the insulating case where the Fermi energy lies in the gap between two bulk bands as well as in the metallic regime and interpolates smoothly between both regimes. The algorithm is gauge-invariant by construction, efficient and yields the Berry conductivity with known and controllable statistical error bars. We apply the algorithm to several paradigmatic models in the field of topological insulators, including Haldane's model on the honeycomb lattice, the multi-band Hofstadter model and the BHZ model, which describes the 2D spin Hall effect observed in CdTe/HgTe/CdTe quantum well heterostructures.

abstract: There are suggestive experimental indications that the leptons, neutrinos, and quarks are composite and that their structure is described by the quantum group SLq(2). Since the hypothetical preons must be very heavy relative to the masses of the leptons, neutrinos, and quarks, there must be a very strong binding field to permit these composite particles to form. Unfortunately there are no experiments direct enough to establish the order of magnitude needed to make the SLq(2) Lagrangian dynamics quantitative. It is possible, however, to parametrize the preon masses and interactions that would be necessary to stabilize the three particle composite representing the leptons, neutrinos, and quarks. In this note we examine possible parametrizations of the masses and the interactions of these hypothetical structures. We also note an alternative view of SLq(2) preons.

A classical analysis reveals regular (chaotic) dynamics at low (higher) energy in the spherical region, coexisting with a robustly regular dynamics in the deformed region. A quantum analysis discloses, amidst a complicated environment, persisting regular multiplets of states associated with partial U(5) and quasi SU(3) dynamical symmetries.

abstract: A Field Generated Coherence (FGC)' based 3-field cyclically-driven 4-level atomic system, which is an extended version of $\Lambda$ type schemes, is investigated for Autler-Townes Triplet (ATT) absorption spectroscopy. Two dark lines which appear in the ATT spectrum, are the essence of the generated multiple controllable Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) windows for a superluminal Gaussian light pulse. We also investigate enhancement in the group advance time for a probe superluminal Gaussian light pulse even with no additional losses while generating nonlinear coherence Kerr effect through an intense monochrmatic laser field. Consequently, the pulse leaves the steep anomalous region of the medium by $38 \mu s$ sooner than the pulse when retrieved from the Kerr-free system. A co-linear propagation of the driving fields is suggested to minimize our explored incoherence Doppler broadening effect on the probe pulse. Indeed, the analytically observed undistorted retrieved Gaussian light pulse, which is a necessary and useful requirement for realization of the results in laboratory, is also shown and analyzed explicitly.

abstract: We study the motion of a cold atom in a frequency-modulated standing laser wave. If the detuning between the atomic electronic transition and the field is large, the atom moves in a modulated optical potential demonstrating known classical nonlinear effects such as chaos and nonlinear resonances. If the atom-field detuning is small, then two optical potentials emerge in the system, and the atom performs Landau-Zener (LZ) tunnelings between them. It is a radically non-classical behavior. However, we show that classical nonlinear structures in system's phase space (KAM-tori and chaotic layers) survive. Quantum effect of LZ tunnelings only induces small random jumps of trajectories between these structures (dynamical tunneling).

We characterize topological phase diagrams by a ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times{\mathbb Z}_2$ partial Berry-phase invariant, and show that, despite the trivial crystal geometry, no unique bulk-boundary correspondence exists. We trace this behavior to the anisotropic quasiparticle bulk gap closing, linear vs. quadratic, and argue that this provides a unifying principle for gapless topological superconductivity. Experimental implications for tunneling conductance measurements are addressed, relevant for lead chalcogenide materials.

abstract: We explore a single-photon approach to Rydberg state excitation and Rydberg blockade. Using detailed theoretical models, we show the feasibility of direct excitation, predict the effect of background electric fields, and calculate the required interatomic distance to observe Rydberg blockade. We then measure and control the electric field environment to enable coherent control of Rydberg states. With this coherent control, we demonstrate Rydberg blockade of two atoms separated by 6.6(3) {\mu}m. When compared with the more common two-photon excitation method, this single-photon approach is advantageous because it eliminates channels for decoherence through photon scattering and AC Stark shifts from the intermediate state while moderately increasing Doppler sensitivity.

abstract: A recently implemented relativistic four-component configuration interaction approach to study ${\cal{P}}$- and ${\cal{T}}$-odd interaction constants in atoms and molecules is employed to determine the electron electric dipole moment effective electric field in the $\Omega=1$ first excited state of the ThO molecule. We obtain a value of $E_{\text{eff}} = 75.6 \left[\frac{\rm GV}{\rm cm}\right]$ with an estimated error bar of $3\%$ and $10\%$ smaller than a previously reported result [arXiv:1308.0414 [physics.atom-ph]]. Using the same wavefunction model we obtain an excitation energy of $T_v^{\Omega=1} = 5329$ [\cm], in accord with the experimental value within $2\%$. In addition, we report the implementation of the magnetic hyperfine interaction constant $A_{||}$ as an expectation value, resulting in $A_{||} = -1335$ [MHz] for the $\Omega=1$ state in ThO. The smaller effective electric field increases the previously measured upper bound to the electron electric dipole moment interaction constant [arXiv:1310.7534v2 [physics.atom-ph]] and thus mildly mitigates constraints to possible extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.

abstract: We define a superfluid state to be a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS), which, at zero temperature, satisfies certain \emph{metastability conditions}, which physically express that there should be a sufficiently small energy-momentum transfer between the particles of the fluid and the surroundings (e.g., pipe). It is shown that two models, the Girardeau model and the Huang-Yang-Luttinger (HYL) model describe superfluids in this sense and, moreover, that, in the case of the HYL model, the metastability condition is directly related to Nozi\`{e}res' conjecture that, due to the repulsive interaction, the condensate does not suffer fragmentation into two (or more) parts, thereby assuring its quantum coherence. The models are rigorous examples of NESS in which the system is not finite, but rather a many-body system. \end{abstract}

abstract: The control laws based on quantum Lyapunov control method are designed to prepare operators for two level open quantum systems in this paper. A novel Lyapunov function is proposed according to a matrix logarithm function. The higher accuracy and faster convergence of the novel Lyapunov function proposed are analyzed by comparing with the operator distance . We adopt three control fields, and design two types of control law forms. The first form is to use one control law to offset the influence of the dissipation, while the other one is to use all three control laws to offset the dissipation. Moreover, the robustness of the system Hamiltonian with uncertainty is further investigated to comprehend the performances of control laws. NOT gates are prepared by the designed control laws for open quantum systems as well as closed quantum systems in numerical experiments to verify the superiority of, in which the performance indexes of distance and fidelity are compared and analyzed.

abstract: We examine the response of an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector coupled to a massless scalar field on the (3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime, in the Boulware, Hartle-Hawking and Unruh states, for static detectors and detectors on circular geodesics, by primarily numerical methods. For the static detector, the response in the Hartle-Hawking state exhibits the known thermality at the local Hawking temperature, and the response in the Unruh state is thermal at the local Hawking temperature in the limit of a large detector energy gap. For the circular-geodesic detector, we find evidence of thermality in the limit of a large energy gap for the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh states, at a temperature that exceeds the Doppler-shifted local Hawing temperature. Detailed quantitative comparisons between the three states are given. The response in the Hartle-Hawking state is compared with the response in the Minkowski vacuum and in the Minkowski thermal state for the corresponding Rindler, drifted Rindler, and circularly accelerated trajectories. The analysis takes place within first-order perturbation theory and relies in an essential way on stationarity.

abstract: One-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks show a rich spectrum of topological phases that have so far been exclusively analysed in momentum space. In this work we introduce an alternative approach to topology which is based on the scattering matrix of a quantum walk, adapting concepts from time-independent systems. For gapped quantum walks, topological invariants at quasienergies 0 and {\pi} probe directly the existence of protected boundary states, while quantum walks with a non-trivial quasienergy winding have a discrete number of perfectly transmistting unidirectional modes. Our classification provides a unified framework that includes all known types of topology in one dimensional discrete-time quantum walks and is very well suited for the analysis of finite size and disorder effects. We provide a simple scheme to directly measure the topological invariants in an optical quantum walk experiment.

abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized biomedical science by providing non-invasive, three-dimensional biological imaging. However, spatial resolution in conventional MRI systems is limited to tens of microns, which is insufficient for imaging on molecular and atomic scales. Here we demonstrate an MRI technique that provides sub-nanometer spatial resolution in three dimensions, with single electron-spin sensitivity. Our imaging method works under ambient conditions and can measure ubiquitous 'dark' spins, which constitute nearly all spin targets of interest and cannot otherwise be individually detected. In this technique, the magnetic quantum-projection noise of dark spins is measured using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer located near the surface of a diamond chip. The spatial distribution of spins surrounding the NV magnetometer is imaged with a scanning magnetic-field gradient. To evaluate the performance of the NV-MRI technique, we image the three-dimensional landscape of dark electronic spins at and just below the diamond surface and achieve an unprecedented combination of resolution (0.8 nm laterally and 1.5 nm vertically) and single-spin sensitivity. Our measurements uncover previously unidentified electronic spins on the diamond surface, which can potentially be used as resources for improved magnetic imaging of samples proximal to the NV-diamond sensor. This three-dimensional NV-MRI technique is immediately applicable to diverse systems including imaging spin chains, readout of individual spin-based quantum bits, and determining the precise location of spin labels in biological systems.

abstract: We investigate the measurement-induced dephasing of a qubit coupled with a single-mode cavity in the vacuum limit. Dephasing of the qubit state takes place through the ntanglement of the qubit and the single probe photon sent to the cavity, while the cavity mode never occupies a photon. We find that the qubit state is dephased even if the cavity is always in the vacuum state. This dephasing is caused purely by the interaction between the qubit and the vacuum field. We also show that this vacuum-fluctuation-induced dephasing takes place much faster than the spontaneous decay of the qubit excited state, and therefore our prediction is observable in a real experiment.

abstract: Black Holes are unique objects which allow for meaningful theoretical studies of strong gravity and even quantum gravity effects. An infalling and a distant observer would have very different views on the structure of the world. However, a careful analysis has shown that it entails no genuine contradictions for physics, and the paradigm of observer complementarity has been coined. Recently this picture was put into doubt. In particular, it was argued that in old Black Holes a firewall must form in order to protect the basic principles of quantum mechanics. This AMPS paradox has already been discussed in a vast number of papers with different attitudes and conclusions. Here we want to argue that a possible source of confusion is neglection of quantum gravity effects. Contrary to widespread perception, it does not necessarily mean that effective field theory is inapplicable in rather smooth neighbourhoods of large Black Hole horizons. The real offender might be an attempt to consistently use it over the huge distances from the near-horizon zone of old Black Holes to the early radiation. We give simple estimates to support this viewpoint and show how the Page time and (somewhat more speculative) scrambling time do appear.

abstract: Over the last three decades entanglement entropy has been obtained for quantum fields propagating in genus zero topologies (Spheres). For scalar fields propagating in these topologies, it has been shown that the entanglement entropy scales as area. In the last few years non-trivial topologies are increasingly relevant for different areas. For instance, in describing quantum phases, it has been realized that long-range entangled states are described by topological order. If quantum entanglement can plausibly provide explanation for these, it then imperative to obtain entanglement entropy in these topologies. In this work, using two different methods, we explicitly show that the entanglement entropy scales as area of the genus-1 geometry.

abstract: We interpret the Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality as a kind of contextual probabilistic inequality in which one combines data collected in experiments performed for three different contexts. In the original version of the inequality these contexts have the temporal nature and they are given by three pairs of instances of time, $(t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), (t_3, t_4),$ where $t_1 < t_2 < t_3.$ We generalize LG conditions of macroscopic realism and noninvasive measurability in the general contextual framework. Our formulation is done in the purely probabilistic terms: existence of the context independent joint probability distribution $P$ and the possibility to reconstruct the experimentally found marginal (two dimensional) probability distributions from the $P.$ We derive an analog of the LG inequality, "contextual LG inequality", and use it as a test of "quantum-likeness" of statistical data collected in a series of experiments on recognition of ambiguous figures. In our experimental study the figure under recognition is the Schroeder stair which is shown with rotations for different angles. Contexts are encoded by dynamics of rotations: clockwise, anticlockwise, and random. Our data demonstrated violation of the contextual LG inequality for some combinations of aforementioned contexts. Since in quantum theory and experiments with quantum physical systems this inequality is violated, e.g., in the form of the original LG-inequality, our result can be interpreted as a sign that the quantum(-like) models can provide a more adequate description of the data generated in the process of recognition of ambiguous figures.

abstract: We investigate "the Wojcik model" introduced and studied by Wojcik et al., which is a one-defect quantum walk (QW) having a single phase at the origin. They reported that giving a phase at one point causes an astonishing effect for localization. There are three types of measures having important roles in the study of QWs: time-averaged limit measure, weak limit measure, and stationary measure. The first two measures imply a coexistence of localized behavior and the ballistic spreading in the QW. As Konno et al. suggested, the time-averaged limit and stationary measures are closely related to each other for some models. In this paper, we focus on a relation between the two measures for the Wojcik model. The stationary measure was already obtained by our previous work. Here, we get the time-averaged limit measure by several methods. Our results show that the stationary measure is a special case of the time-averaged limit measure.

abstract: The possibility of finding the measurable maximal energy and the minimal time interval is discussed in different quantum aspects. It is found that the linear generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) approach gives a non-physical result. Based on large scale Schwarzshild solution, the quadratic GUP approach is utilized. The calculations are performed at the shortest distance, at which the general relativity is assumed to be a good approximation for the quantum gravity and at larger distances, as well. It is found that both maximal energy and minimal time have the order of the Planck time. Then, the uncertainties in both quantities are accordingly bounded. Some physical insights are addressed. Also, the implications on the physics of early Universe and on quantized mass are outlined. The results are related to the existence of finite cosmological constant and minimum mass (mass quanta).

abstract: We derive the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation for the system wave vector and use it to describe the excitation energy transfer dynamics in molecular aggregates. We suggest a quantum-measurement based method of estimating the excitation transfer time. Adequacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated by performing calculations on a model system. The theory is then applied to study the excitation transfer dynamics in a photosynthetic pigment-protein Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) aggregate using both the Debye spectral density and the spectral density obtained from earlier molecular dynamics simulations containing strong vibrational high-frequency modes. The obtained results show that the excitation transfer times in the FMO system are affected by the presence of the vibrational modes, however the transfer pathways remain the same.

abstract: In this introductory note, I describe my particular view of the notion of ontological commitments as honest and pragmatic working hypotheses that assume the existence (out there) of certain entities represented by the symbols in our theory. I argue that this is not naive, in the sense that it does not entail the belief that the hypotheses could ever be proved to be true (or false), but it is nevertheless justified by the success and predictive power of the theory that contains the concepts assumed to exist. I also claim that the ontological commitments one holds (even if tacitly so) have a great influence on what kind of science is produced, how it is used, and how it is understood. Not only I justify this claim, but I also propose a sketch of a possible falsification of it. As a natural conclusion, I defend the importance of identifying, clarifying and making explicit one's ontological commitments if fruitful scientific discussions are to be had. Finally, I compare my point of view with that of some philosophers and scientists who have put forward similar notions.

abstract: We show that the cross Wigner function can be written in the form $W(\psi, \phi)= \hat S (\psi \otimes \overline{\hat\phi})$ where ${\hat\phi}$ is the Fourier transform of $\phi$ and $\hat S$ is a metaplectic operator that projects onto a linear symplectomorphism $S$ consisting of a rotation along an ellipse in phase space (or in the time-frequency space). This formulation can be extended to generic Weyl symbols and yields an interesting fractional generalization of the Weyl-Wigner formalism. It also provides a suitable approach to study the Bopp phase space representation of quantum mechanics, familiar from deformation quantization. Using the "metaplectic formulation" of the Wigner transform we construct a complete set of intertwiners relating the Weyl and the Bopp pseudo-differential operators. This is an important result that allows us to prove the spectral and dynamical equivalence of the Schr\"odinger and the Bopp representations of quantum mechanics.

abstract: Since it is commonly believed that the observed large-scale structure of the Universe is an imprint of quantum fluctuations existing at the very early stage of its evolution, it is reasonable to pose the question: Do the effects of quantum nonlocality, which are well established now by the laboratory studies, manifest themselves also in the early Universe? We try to answer this question by utilizing the results of a few experiments, namely, with the superconducting multi-Josephson-junction loops and the ultracold gases in periodic potentials. Employing a close analogy between the above-mentioned setups and the simplest one-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological model, we show that the specific nonlocal correlations revealed in the laboratory studies might be of considerable importance also in treating the strongly-nonequilibrium phase transitions of Higgs fields in the early Universe. Particularly, they should substantially reduce the number of topological defects (e.g., domain walls) expected due to independent establishment of the new phases in the remote spatial regions. This gives us a hint for resolving a long-standing problem of the excessive concentration of topological defects, inconsistent with observational constraints. The same effect may be also relevant to the recent problem of the anomalous behavior of cosmic microwave background fluctuations at large angular scales.

abstract: Maldacena and Susskind have proposed a correspondence between wormholes and entanglement, dubbed ER=EPR. We study this in the context of 3d topological quantum field theory, where we show that the formation of a wormhole is the same process as creating a particle-antiparticle pair. A key feature of the ER=EPR proposal is that certain apparently entangled degrees of freedom turn out to be the same. We name this phenomenon "fake entanglement", and show how it arises in our topological quantum field theory model.

We have also presented a novel scheme of excitation using chirped pulses and shown that in addition to generating coherence in the system it is possible to alter the translational states of the atoms.

abstract: The entanglement entropy for a quantum critical system across a boundary with a corner exhibits a sub-leading logarithmic scaling term with a scale-invariant coefficient. Using a Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion, we calculate this universal quantity for a square-lattice bilayer Heisenberg model at its quantum critical point. We find, for this 2+1 dimensional O(3) universality class, that it is thrice the value calculated previously for the Ising universality class. This relation gives substantial evidence that this coefficient provides a measure of the number of degrees of freedom of the theory, analogous to the central charge in a 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory.

abstract: One of the most widely used techniques for measuring the orbital angular momentum components of a light beam is to flatten the spiral phase front of a mode, in order to couple it to a single-mode optical fiber. This method, however, suffers from an efficiency that depends on the orbital angular momentum of the initial mode and on the presence of higher order radial modes. The reason is that once the phase has been flattened, the field retains its ringed intensity pattern and is therefore a nontrivial superposition of purely radial modes, of which only the fundamental one couples to a single mode optical fiber. In this paper, we study the efficiency of this technique both theoretically and experimentally. We find that even for low values of the OAM, a large amount of light can fall outside the fundamental mode of the fiber, and we quantify the losses as functions of the waist of the coupling beam of the orbital angular momentum and radial indices. Our results can be used as a tool to remove the efficiency bias where fair-sampling loopholes are not a concern. However, we hope that our study will encourage the development of better detection methods of the orbital angular momentum content of a beam of light.

Additionally, we introduce an explanation for the occurrence of quantum structures in the mechanisms and dynamics of concepts and, more generally, in cognitive and decision processes, according to which human thought is a well structured superposition of a 'logical thought' and a 'conceptual thought', and the latter usually prevails over the former, at variance with some widespread beliefs

abstract: This paper is concerned with translation invariant networks of linear quantum stochastic systems with nearest neighbour interaction mediated by boson fields. The systems are associated with sites of a one-dimensional chain or a multidimensional lattice and are governed by coupled linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). Such interconnections of open quantum systems are relevant, for example, to the phonon theory of crystalline solids, atom trapping in optical lattices and quantum metamaterials. In order to represent a large-scale open quantum harmonic oscillator, the coefficients of the coupled QSDEs must satisfy certain physical realizability conditions. These are established in the form of matrix algebraic equations for the parameters of an individual building block of the network and its interaction with the neighbours and external fields. We also discuss the computation of mean square performance functionals with block Toeplitz weighting matrices for such systems in the thermodynamic limit per site for unboundedly increasing fragments of the lattice.

abstract: The combination of interactions and nonadiabaticity in many body systems is shown to induce magnetic gauge potentials in the equation of motion for the one-body reduced density matrix as well as the effective Schroedinger equation for the natural orbitals. The consequences of induced gauge geometry for charge and energy transfer are illustrated in the exact nonlinear dynamics of a three-site Hubbard ring ramped into a Floquet state by a time dependent circulating electric potential. Remarkably, the pumped charge flows against the driving in the strongly interacting regime, and the quasienergy level shift, which defines the work done on the system, can become negative.

Moreover, we show that there is no influence of the curvature of the spacetime on this non-vanishing contribution to the ground state energy of a massive scalar field.

abstract: It is well known that unitary symmetries can be `gauged', i.e. defined to act in a local way, which leads to a corresponding gauge field. Gauging, for example, the charge conservation symmetry leads to electromagnetic gauge fields. It is an open question whether an analogous process is possible for time reversal which is an anti-unitary symmetry. Here we discuss a route to gauging time reversal symmetry which applies to gapped quantum ground states that admit a tensor network representation. The tensor network representation of quantum states provides a notion of locality for the wave function coefficient and hence a notion of locality for the action of complex conjugation in anti-unitary symmetries. Based on that, we show how time reversal can be applied locally and also describe time reversal symmetry twists which act as gauge fluxes through nontrivial loops in the system. As with unitary symmetries, gauging time reversal provides useful access to the physical properties of the system. We show how topological invariants of certain time reversal symmetric topological phases in $D=1,2$ are readily extracted using these ideas.

abstract: We discuss phase transitions in PT-symmetric optical systems. We show that due to frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity, an optical system can have PT-symmetry at isolated frequency points only. An assumption of the existence of a PT-symmetric system in a continuous frequency interval violates the causality principle. Therefore, the ideal symmetry-breaking transition cannot be observed by simply varying the frequency.

abstract: Synthetic diamond production is key to the development of quantum metrology and quantum information applications of diamond. The major quantum sensor and qubit candidate in diamond is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center. This lattice defect comes in four different crystallographic orientations leading to an intrinsic inhomogeneity among NV centers that is undesirable in some applications. Here, we report a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor decomposition (MPCVD) diamond growth technique on (111)-oriented substrates that yields perfect alignment ($94\pm2%$) of as-grown NV centers along a single crystallographic direction. In addition, clear evidence is found that the majority ($74\pm4%$) of the aligned NV centers were formed by the nitrogen being first included in the (111) growth surface and then followed by the formation of a neighboring vacancy on top. The achieved homogeneity of the grown NV centers will tremendously benefit quantum information and metrology applications.

abstract: We report on the formation of ultralong-range Rydberg D-state molecules via photoassociation in an ultracold cloud of rubidium atoms. By applying a magnetic offset field on the order of 10 G and high resolution spectroscopy, we are able to resolve individual rovibrational molecular states. A full theory, using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation including s- and p-wave scattering, reproduces the measured binding energies. The calculated molecular wavefunctions show that in the experiment we can selectively excite stationary molecular states with an extraordinary degree of alignment or anti-alignment with respect to the magnetic field axis.

abstract: We demonstrate sub-Doppler laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping of the rare earth element Holmium. Atoms are loaded from an atomic beam source and captured in six-beam $\sigma_+ - \sigma_-$ molasses using a strong $J=15/2 \leftrightarrow J=17/2$ cycling transition at $\lambda=410.5 \rm nm$. Due to the small difference in hyperfine splittings and Land\'e $g$-factors in the lower and upper levels of the cooling transition the MOT is self-repumped without additional repump light, and deep sub-Doppler cooling is achieved with the magnetic trap turned on. We measure the leakage out of the cycling transition to metastable states and find a branching ratio $\sim 10^{-5}$ which is adequate for state resolved measurements on hyperfine encoded qubits.

abstract: In most experiments on flux qubits,the "measurement" is performed by coupling the system to a dc SQUID and recording the distribution of switching currents for the latter;this measurement protocol is very far from the classic von Neumann ("projective") scheme,in that very little information is obtained from a single run,rather one has to repeat the experiment tens of thosands of times to extract anything useful.Here, concentrating on the equlibrium behavior of the flux qubit,we carry out an analytic calculation of the dc-SQUID switching current distribution as a function of external bias flux on the qubit,and compare our predictions with the data from experiments conducted at Delft and NTT.

abstract: We derive analytic expressions for the classical Casimir-Polder free energy and force for a polarizable (magnetizable) atom (microparticle) interacting with thin films, made of different materials, or graphene. It is shown that for an isolated dielectric film the free energy and force decrease quicker with separation, as compared to the case of atom interacting with a thick plate (semispace). For metallic films some peculiar features depending on the model of a metal used are analyzed. For an atom interacting with graphene we demonstrate that at room temperature the classical regime is achieved at about $1.5\,\mu$m separation. In this regime the contributions to the free energy and force due to atomic magnetic polarizability are suppressed, as compared to main terms caused by the atomic electric polarizability. According to our results, at separations above $5\,\mu$m the Casimir-Polder interaction of atoms with graphene is of the same strength as with an ideal-metal plane. The classical interaction of atoms with thin films deposited on substrates is also considered.

abstract: We present a generalized quasi-particle theory for bosonic lattice systems, which naturally contains all relevant collective modes, including the Higgs amplitude in the strongly correlated superfluid. In contrast to Bogoliubov theory, this non-perturbative method does not rely on a small condensate depletion and is valid for any interaction strength in three spatial dimensions. It is based on an expansion around the bosonic Gutzwiller ground state in terms of appropriately chosen fluctuation operators and lays the foundation for the description of real-time dynamics in terms of the natural, weakly interacting quasi-particles. Furthermore, it provides a systematic framework for efficiently calculating observables beyond the Gutzwiller approximation and for including external perturbations, as well as higher order decay and interactions in terms of quasi-particle operators. It allows for the construction of an alternative path integral approach in terms of quasi-particle coherent states.

abstract: The Rabi model considers a two-level system (or spin-1/2) coupled to a quantized harmonic oscillator and describes the simplest interaction between matter and light. The recent experimental progress in solid-state circuit quantum electrodynamics has engendered theoretical efforts to quantitatively describe the mathematical and physical aspects of the light-matter interaction beyond the rotating wave approximation. We develop a stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation approach which enables us to access the strong-coupling limit of the Rabi model and study the effects of dissipation, and AC drive in an exact manner. We include the effect of ohmic noise on the non-Markovian spin dynamics resulting in Kondo-type correlations, as well as cavity losses. We compute the time evolution of spin variables in various conditions. As a consideration for future work, we discuss the possibility to reach a steady state with one polariton in realistic experimental conditions.

Using the \textit{physical} boundary conditions for the Green's function we derive for both systems the resonance poles and the resonance wave functions. The matching conditions for the resonance wave functions coincide with those obtained by the self-adjoint extensions of the point potentials and also by the modelling of the $\delta'(x)$. We find that, with our definitions, the pure $b\delta'(x)$ barrier is semi-transparent \textit{independent} of the value of $b$.

abstract: We demonstrate the real-time detection of single photogenerated electrons in two different lateral double quantum dots made in AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells having a thin or a thick AlGaAs barrier layer. The observed incident laser power and photon energy dependences of the photoelectron detection efficiency both indicate that the trapped photoelectrons are, for the thin barrier sample, predominantly photogenerated in the buffer layer followed by tunneling into one of the two dots, whereas for the thick barrier sample they are directly photogenerated in the well. For the latter, single photoelectron detection after selective excitation of the heavy and light hole state in the dot is well resolved. This ensures the applicability of our quantum well-based quantum dot systems for the coherent transfer from single photon polarization to single electron spin states.

abstract: We investigate a resonantly modulated harmonic mode, dispersively coupled to a nonequilibrium few-level quantum system. We focus on the regime where the relaxation rate of the system greatly exceeds that of the mode, and develop a quantum adiabatic approach for analyzing the dynamics. Semiclassically, the dispersive coupling leads to a mutual tuning of the mode and system into and out of resonance with their modulating fields, leading to multistability. In the important case where the system has two energy levels and is excited near resonance, the compound system can have up to three metastable states. Nonadiabatic quantum fluctuations associated with spontaneous transitions in the few-level system lead to switching between the metastable states. We provide parameter estimates for currently available systems.

abstract: There has been much discussion in the literature about rival measures of classical polarization in three dimensions. We gather and compare the various proposed measures of polarization, creating a geometric representation of the polarization state space in the process. We use majorization, previously used in quantum information, as a criterion to establish a partial ordering on the polarization state space. Using this criterion and other considerations, the most useful polarization measure in three dimensions is found to be one dependent on the Bloch vector decomposition of the polarization matrix.

abstract: We calculate the effect of two kinds of randomness on the hopping of an excitation through a nearly regular Rydberg gas. We present calculations for how fast the excitation can hop away from its starting position for different dimensional lattices and for different levels of randomness. We also examine the asymptotic in time final position of the excitation to determine whether or not the excitation can be localized. The one dimensional system is an example of Anderson localization where the randomness is in the off-diagonal elements although the long-range nature of the interaction leads to non-exponential decay with distance. The two dimensional square lattice shows a mixture of extended and localized states for large randomness while there is no visible sign of localized states for weak randomness. The three dimensional cubic lattice has few localized states even for strong randomness.

abstract: We propose an analog superconducting quantum simulator for a one-dimensional model featuring momentum-dependent (nonlocal) electron-phonon couplings of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and "breathing-mode" types. Because its corresponding vertex function depends on both the electron- and phonon quasimomenta, this model does not belong to the realm of validity of the Gerlach-L\"{o}wen theorem that rules out any nonanalyticities in single-particle properties. The superconducting circuit behind the proposed simulator entails an array of transmon qubits and microwave resonators. By applying microwave driving fields to the qubits, a small-polaron Bloch state with an arbitrary quasimomentum can be prepared in this system within times several orders of magnitude shorter than the typical qubit decoherence times. We demonstrate that in this system -- by varying the circuit parameters -- one can readily reach the critical coupling strength required for observing the sharp transition from a nondegenerate (single-particle) ground state corresponding to zero quasimomentum ($K_{\textrm{gs}}=0$) to a twofold-degenerate small-polaron ground state at nonzero quasimomenta $K_{\textrm{gs}}$ and $-K_{\textrm{gs}}$. Through exact numerical diagonalization of our effective Hamiltonian, we show how this nonanalyticity is reflected in the relevant single-particle properties (ground-state energy, quasiparticle residue, average number of phonons). The proposed setup provides an ideal testbed for studying quantum dynamics of polaron formation in systems with strongly momentum-dependent electron-phonon interactions.

abstract: Based on the idea that the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields can induce instantaneous correlated dipoles, we study the far-zone Casimir-Polder potential between two atoms in the Boulware, Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacua outside a Schwarzschild black hole. We show that, at spatial infinity, the Casimir-Polder potential in the Boulware vacuum is similar to that in the Minkowski vacuum in flat spacetime with a behavior of $R^{-7}$, so is in the Unruh vacuum as a result of the backscattering of the Hawking radiation from the black hole off the spacetime curvature. However, the interatomic Casimir-Polder potential in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum behaves like that in a thermal bath at the Hawking temperature. In the region near the event horizon of the black hole, the modifications caused by the space-time curvature make the interatomic Casimir-Polder potential smaller in all three vacuum states.

abstract: We show that the numerical strong disorder renormalization group algorithm (SDRG) of Hikihara et. al. [Phys. Rev. B 60, 12116 (1999)] for the one-dimensional disordered Heisenberg model naturally describes a tree tensor network (TTN) with an irregular structure defined by the strength of the couplings. Employing the holographic interpretation of the TTN in Hilbert space, we compute expectation values, correlation functions and the entanglement entropy using the geometrical properties of the TTN. We find that the disorder averaged spin-spin correlation scales with the average path length through the tensor network while the entanglement entropy scales with the minimal surface connecting two regions. Furthermore, the entanglement entropy increases with both disorder and system size, resulting in an area-law violation. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of a self-assembling TTN approach to disordered systems and quantitatively validate the connection between holography and quantum many-body systems.

abstract: The canonical structure of theories whose Lagrangian contains higher powers of time derivatives is often obscured by the nonlinear relationship between the velocities and momenta. We use the Dirac formalism and define a generalized Legendre transform to overcome some of the difficulties associated with inverting the relation between velocities and momenta. We are then able to define a standard single valued symplectic structure on phase space and a compatible single valued Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the application of our formalism in several examples.

The effect of field fluctuations, present at this stage in all SASE free-electron-laser (FEL) facilities, as well as the effect of the interaction volume integration, are also discussed.

We demonstrate the method on the example of an excitonic qubit in self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots coupled to super-Ohmic reservoir of acoustic phonons.

abstract: We investigate constraints imposed by entanglement on gravity in the context of holography. First, by demanding that relative entropy is positive and using the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy functional, we find certain constraints at a nonlinear level for the dual gravity. Second, by considering Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we show that for a class of small perturbations around the vacuum state, the positivity of the two point function of the field theory stress tensor guarantees the positivity of the relative entropy. Further, if we impose that the entangling surface closes off smoothly in the bulk interior, we find restrictions on the coupling constant in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We also give an example of an anisotropic excited state in an unstable phase with broken conformal invariance which leads to a negative relative entropy.

abstract: We illustrate the physical significance and mathematical origin of resurgent trans-series expansions for energy eigenvalues in quantum mechanical problems with degenerate harmonic minima, by using the uniform WKB approach. We provide evidence that the perturbative expansion, combined with a global eigenvalue condition, contains all information needed to generate all orders of the non-perturbative multi-instanton expansion. This provides a dramatic realization of the concept of resurgence, whose structure is naturally encoded in the resurgence triangle. We explain the relation between the uniform WKB approach, multi-instantons, and resurgence theory. The essential idea applies to any perturbative expansion, and so is also relevant for quantum field theories with degenerate minima which can be continuously connected to quantum mechanical systems.

We show how physical 3 principles impose restrictions such that the non-diffracting Airy beams cannot be of infinite extent as has been argued, and introduce for the first time quantitative expressions for the maximum transverse and longitudinal extent of Airy beams. We show that under the appropriate physical conditions it is possible to obtain higher-order Airy beams.

abstract: A quaternionic commutator bracket for position and momentum shows that the quaternionic wave function, \emph{viz.} $\widetilde{\psi}=(\frac{i}{c}\,\psi_0\,,\vec{\psi})$, represents a state of a particle with orbital angular momentum, $L=3\,\hbar$, resulting from the internal structure of the particle. This angular momentum can be attributed to spin of the particle. The vector $\vec{\psi}$, points along the direction of $\vec{L}$. When a charged particle is placed in an electromagnetic fields the interaction energy reveals that the magnetic moments interact with the electric and magnetic fields giving rise to terms similar to Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher effects.

By varying drive parameters the impact of environmental vacuum fluctuations with continuous spectral distribution onto system observables can be tuned in a distinctive way. This provides experimentally feasible measurement schemes for the Lamb shift in superconducting circuits based on Cooper pair boxes, where it can be detected either in shifted dressed transition frequencies or in pumped charge currents.

abstract: By taking into account the full four band energy spectrum, we calculate the transmission probability and conductance of electrons across symmetric and asymmetric double potential barrier with a confined interlayer potential difference in bilayer graphene. For energies less than the interlayer coupling \gamma_{1}, E<\gamma_1, we have one channel for transmission which exhibits resonances, even for incident particles with energies less than the strength of barriers, E < U_j, depending on the double barrier geometry. In contrast, for higher energies E > \gamma_{1}, we obtain four possible ways for transmission resulting from the two propagating modes. We compute the associated transmission probabilities as well as their contribution to the conductance, study the effect of the double barrier geometry.

Here, after a brief introduction into this quantum chemical method, we discuss criteria that determine the accuracy of DMRG calculations.

abstract: The transmon superconducting qubit is being intensely investigated as a promising approach for the physical implementation of quantum information processing, and high quality factors of order $10^6$ have been achieved both in two- and three-dimensional architectures. These high quality factors enable detailed investigations of decoherence mechanisms. An intrinsic decoherence process originates from the coupling between the qubit degree of freedom and the quasiparticles that tunnel across Josephson junctions. In a transmon, tunneling of a single quasiparticle is associated with a change in parity. Here we present the theory of the parity-switching rates in single-junction transmons and compare it with recent measurements. We also show that parity switching can have an important role in limiting the coherence time.

abstract: We examine the existence of the interaction-generated quantum anomalous Hall phase on the honeycomb lattice. For the spinless model at half filling, the existence of a quantum anomalous Hall phase (Chern insulator phase) has been predicted using mean-field methods. However, recent exact diagonalization studies for small clusters with periodic boundary condition have not found a clear sign of an interaction-driven Chern insulator phase. We use exact diagonalization method to study properties of small clusters with open boundary condition and, contrary to previous studies, we find clear signatures of the topological phase transition for finite size clusters. We also examine applicability of the entangled-plaquette state (correlator-product state) ansatz to describe the ground states of the system. Within this approach the lattice is covered with plaquettes and the ground state wave-function is written in terms of the plaquette coefficients. Configurational weights can then be optimized using a variational Monte Carlo algorithm. Using the entangled-plaquette state ansatz we study the ground state properties of the system for larger system sizes and show that the results agree with the exact diagonalization results for small clusters. This confirms validity of the entangled-plaquette state ansatz to describe the ground states of the system and provides further confirmation of the existence of the quantum anomalous Hall phase in the thermodynamic limit, as predicted by the mean-field theory calculations.

abstract: We study theoretically the interaction between two species of bosons confined parabolically in one transverse direction but with a finite separation between the centers of the confining potentials. We demonstrate the existence of new types of confinement-induced Feshbach resonances that can be tuned by changing separation between the layers. They are much sharper than usual two-dimensional confinement-induced resonances, and can be observed in the shaking spectrum of the two-dimensional layers, as shown by detailed many-body calculations for a thermal Bose gas.

abstract: This paper presents the first realisation of a simultaneous $^{87}$Rb -$^{85}$Rb Mach-Zehnder atom interferometer with Bose-condensed atoms. A number of ambitious proposals for precise terrestrial and space based tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle rely on such a system. This implementation utilises hybrid magnetic-optical trapping to produce spatially overlapped condensates with a duty cycle of 20s. A horizontal optical waveguide with co-linear Bragg beamsplitters and mirrors is used to simultaneously address both isotopes in the interferometer. We observe a non-linear phase shift on a non-interacting $^{85}$Rb interferometer as a function of interferometer time, $T$, which we show arises from inter-isotope scattering with the co-incident $^{87}$Rb interferometer. A discussion of implications for future experiments is given.

abstract: Recently a study of the first superposed mechanical quantum object ("machine") visible to the naked eye was published. However, as we show, it turns out that if the object would actually be observed, i.e. would interact with an optical photon, the quantum behavior should vanish. This, the actual observation, has long been suspected in many interpretations of quantum mechanics to be what makes the transition quantum $\rightarrow$ classical, but so far it has not been available for direct experimental study in a mechanical system. We show how any interaction, even a purely quantum one, of sufficient strength can constitute a physical "measurement" - essentially the emergence of an effectively classical object - active observation thus being a sufficient but not necessary criterion. So it seems we have in this case of the "quantum machine" a unique possibility to study, and possibly solve, the long-standing "measurement problem" of quantum mechanics.

abstract: We investigate the time evolution of wave packets in systems with a mixed phase space where regular islands and chaotic motion coexist. For wave packets started in the chaotic sea on average the weight on a quantized torus of the regular island increases due to dynamical tunneling. This flooding weight initially increases linearly and saturates to a value which varies from torus to torus. We demonstrate for the asymptotic flooding weight universal scaling with an effective tunneling coupling for quantum maps and the mushroom billiard. This universality is reproduced by a suitable random matrix model.

abstract: The sphere packing bound, in the form given by Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp, was recently extended to classical-quantum channels, and it was shown that this creates a natural setting for combining probabilistic approaches with some combinatorial ones such as the Lov\'asz theta function. In this paper, we extend the study to the case of constant composition codes. We first extend the sphere packing bound for classical-quantum channels to this case, and we then show that the obtained result is related to a variation of the Lov\'asz theta function studied by Marton. We then propose a further extension to the case of varying channels and codewords with a constant conditional composition given a particular sequence. This extension is then applied to auxiliary channels to deduce a bound which can be interpreted as an extension of the Elias bound.

abstract: A temporally varying discretization often features in discrete gravitational systems and appears in lattice field theory models subject to a coarse graining or refining dynamics. To better understand such discretization changing dynamics in the quantum theory, an according formalism for constrained variational discrete systems is constructed. While the present manuscript focuses on global evolution moves and, for simplicity, restricts to Euclidean configuration spaces, a companion article discusses local evolution moves. In order to link the covariant and canonical picture, the dynamics of the quantum states is generated by propagators which satisfy the canonical constraints and are constructed using the action and group averaging projectors. This projector formalism offers a systematic method for tracing and regularizing divergences in the resulting state sums. Non-trivial coarse graining evolution moves lead to non-unitary, and thus irreversible, projections of physical Hilbert spaces and Dirac observables such that these concepts become evolution move dependent on temporally varying discretizations. The formalism is illustrated in a toy model mimicking a `creation from nothing'. Subtleties arising when applying such a formalism to quantum gravity models are discussed.

We identify the key elements that determine the onset of reversibility in these systems by using a formalism suited for absorbing media and through an exact integration of the dynamics. Moreover, when the quantum emitter separation from the surface is small, we are able to describe the dynamics within a pseudomode description that yields analytical understanding and allows more powerful calculations.

abstract: We study the reachability problem of a quantum system modelled by a quantum automaton. The reachable sets are chosen to be boolean combinations of (closed) subspaces of the state space of the quantum system. Four different reachability properties are considered: eventually reachable, globally reachable, ultimately forever reachable, and infinitely often reachable. The main result of this paper is that all of the four reachability properties are undecidable in general; however, the last three become decidable if the reachable sets are boolean combinations without negation.

abstract: We theoretically study time-resolved photoemission in atoms as probed by attosecond streaking. We review recent advances in the study of the photoelectric effect in the time domain and show that the experimentally accessible time shifts can be decomposed into distinct contributions that stem from the field-free photoionization process itself and from probe-field induced corrections. We perform accurate quantum-mechanical as well as classical simulations of attosecond streaking for effective one-electron systems and determine all relevant contributions to the time delay with attosecond precision. In particular, we investigate the properties and limitations of attosecond streaking for the transition from short-ranged potentials (photodetachment) to long-ranged Coulomb potentials (photoionization). As an example for a more complex system, we study time-resolved photoionization for endohedral fullerenes $A$@$\text{C}_{60}$ and discuss how streaking time shifts are modified due to the interaction of the $\text{C}_{60}$ cage with the probing infrared streaking field.

Attractive and repulsive contact interactions with a sea of fermions are considered. We find excellent agreement between TEBD and variational results and use the variational ansatz to investigate higher lattice bands. We conclude that the lowest band approximation fails at sufficiently strong interactions and develop a new method for computing the Tan contact parameter.

abstract: Quantum-optical techniques allow for generating controllable spin-spin interactions between ions, making trapped ions an ideal quantum simulator of Heisenberg chains. A single parameter, the detuning of the Raman coupling, allows to switch between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains, and to modify the range of the interactions. On the antiferromagnetic side, the system can be tuned from an extreme long-range limit, in which any pair of ions interacts with almost equal strength, to interactions with a $1/r^3$ decay. By exact diagonalization, we study how a system of up to 20 ions behaves upon tuning the interactions. We find that it undergoes a transition from a dimerized state with extremely short-ranged correlations towards a state with quasi long-range order, that is, algebraically decaying correlations. On the ferromagnetic side of the system, we demonstrate the feasibility of witnessing non-locality of quantum correlations.

abstract: As shown in the experiment of She {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101}, 243601 (2008)], a weak laser beam sent through a vertically hanging fiber exerts a transverse force and produces a lateral displacement of the fiber's lower end. The experiment is of obvious theoretical interest in connection with the electromagnetic theory of media. Suggested explanations given for this effect in the past include the famous Abraham-Minkowski issue concerning the "correct" photon momentum in matter. In our opinion such an explanation can hardly be right. Instead, we propose instead a very simple description of the effect implying that the sideways deflection is caused by the radiation force on the {\it obliquely cut} lower end face of the fiber. From a calculation based upon geometrical optics, we find quite good agreement with the observations. We present also, as an alternative approach, a calculation involving wave optics instead of geometrical optics, and find comparable results.

Numerical calculations of the energies reveal that member potentials have multiple quasi-exactly solvable eigenstates and the number of states for higher members are parameter dependent.

abstract: We consider the two most general families of the (1+1)D Dirac systems with transparent scalar potentials, and two related families of the paired reflectionless Schrodinger operators. The ordinary N=2 supersymmetry for such Schrodinger pairs is enlarged up to an exotic N=4 nonlinear centrally extended supersymmetric structure, which involves two bosonic integrals composed from the Lax-Novikov operators for the stationary Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. Each associated single Dirac system displays a proper N=2 nonlinear supersymmetry with a non-standard grading operator. One of the two families of the first and second order systems exhibits the unbroken supersymmetry, while another is described by the broken exotic supersymmetry. The two families are shown to be mutually transmuted by applying a certain limit procedure to the soliton scattering data. We relate the topologically trivial and nontrivial transparent potentials with self-consistent inhomogeneous condensates in Bogoliubov-de Gennes and Gross-Neveu models, and indicate the exotic N=4 nonlinear supersymmetry of the paired reflectionless Dirac systems.

abstract: We introduce and study a new model of interactive proofs: AM(k), or Arthur-Merlin with k non-communicating Merlins. Unlike with the better-known MIP, here the assumption is that each Merlin receives an independent random challenge from Arthur. One motivation for this model (which we explore in detail) comes from the close analogies between it and the quantum complexity class QMA(k), but the AM(k) model is also natural in its own right. We illustrate the power of multiple Merlins by giving an AM(2) protocol for 3SAT, in which the Merlins' challenges and responses consist of only n^{1/2+o(1)} bits each. Our protocol has the consequence that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), any algorithm for approximating a dense CSP with a polynomial-size alphabet must take n^{(log n)^{1-o(1)}} time. Algorithms nearly matching this lower bound are known, but their running times had never been previously explained. Brandao and Harrow have also recently used our 3SAT protocol to show quasipolynomial hardness for approximating the values of certain entangled games. In the other direction, we give a simple quasipolynomial-time approximation algorithm for free games, and use it to prove that, assuming the ETH, our 3SAT protocol is essentially optimal. More generally, we show that multiple Merlins never provide more than a polynomial advantage over one: that is, AM(k)=AM for all k=poly(n). The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games, which follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. on subsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can be closely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame.

abstract: Stronger constraints on the pseudoscalar coupling constants of an axion and axion-like particles with a proton and a neutron are obtained from measurements of the thermal Casimir-Polder force between a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms and a SiO$_2$ plate. For this purpose the additional force acting between a condensate cloud and a plate due to two-axion exchange is calculated. The obtained constraints refer to the axion masses from 0.1meV to 0.3eV which overlap with the region from 0.01meV to 10meV considered at the moment as the most prospective.

abstract: We introduce a quasi-relativistic theory of quantum transport in graphene monolayer. It is based on the Dirac -- Hartry -- Fock self-consistent field approximation, assumption on lattice anti-ferromagnetic ordering and an approach [Falkovsky and Varlamov, Eur.~Phys.~J. {\bf B 56}, 281(2007)]. Minimal conductivity of graphene is shown to be $4.83$ (in units of $e^2/h$) when accounting for non-relativistic current only. Allowing for quasi-relativistic corrections to current due to process of pairs production and magneto-electric effects we obtain the results for the minimal conductivity which are in a very good agreement with experimental data for different supports.

abstract: We propose to use spatial control of the Zeeman energy shifts in an ultracold atomic gas to engineer an interface between topologically distinct regions. This provides an experimentally accessible means for studying the interface physics of topological defects and textures. Using the spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate as an example, we find spinor wave functions that represent defects and textures continuously connecting across the interface between polar and ferromagnetic regions induced by spatially varying Zeeman shifts. By numerical energy minimization we characterize the defect core structures and determine the energetic stability. The techniques proposed could potentially be used in the laboratory to emulate complex interface physics arising, e.g., in cosmological and condensed-matter contexts in both uniform and lattice systems.

The admissible set of boundary conditions at the plates is determined by the requirements that the operator of one-particle energy squared be self-adjoint and positive definite. We show that, in the case of a weak magnetic field and a small separation of the plates, the Casimir force is either attractive or repulsive, depending on the choice of a boundary condition. In the case of a strong magnetic field and a large separation of the plates, the Casimir force is repulsive, being independent of the choice of a boundary condition, as well as of the distance between the plates.

abstract: Nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics generically lead to nonlocal effects which violate relativistic causality. We study these effects using the functional Schrodinger equation for quantum fields and identify a type of nonlocality which causes nearly instantaneous entanglement of spacelike separated systems. We describe a simple example involving widely separated wave-packet (coherent) states, showing that nonlinearity in the Schrodinger evolution causes spacelike entanglement, even in free field theory.

abstract: We describe theoretically the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion in quadratic nonlinear waveguide arrays in the presence of linear loss. We derive a set of discrete Schrodinger-type equations for the biphoton wave function, and the wave function of one photon when the other photon in a pair is lost. We demonstrate effects arising from loss-affected interference between the generated photon pairs and show that nonlinear waveguide arrays can serve as a robust loss-tolerant integrated platform for the generation of entangled photon states with non-classical spatial correlations.

abstract: We investigate the approximate solutions of the Dirac equation with the position-dependent mass particle in the Eckart potential field including the Coulomb tensor interaction by using the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Taking an appropriate approximation to deal with the centrifugal term, the Dirac energy states and the corresponding normalized two-spinor components of the wave function are obtained in closed form. Some special cases of our solution are investigated. Furthermore, we present the correct solutions obtained via the asymptotic iteration method which are in agreement with the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method results.

Finally we discuss quasi-stationary light pulse evolution characterized by frozen spatial spreading for a robust coherent control of slow light pulses.

To this aim, methods to analyze the OAM of an electron beam are fundamentally important and a necessary next step. We demonstrate the measurement of electron beam OAM through a variety of techniques. The use of forked holographic masks, diffraction from geometric apertures, diffraction from a knife-edge and the application of an astigmatic lens are all experimentally demonstrated. The viability and limitations of each are discussed with supporting numerical simulations.

abstract: In a two-mode Bose-Josephson junction formed by a binary mixture of ultracold atoms, macroscopic superpositions of phase states are produced during the time evolution after a sudden quench to zero of the coupling amplitude. Using quantum trajectories and an exact diagonalization of the master equation, we study the effect of one-, two-, and three-body atom losses on the superpositions by analyzing separately the amount of quantum correlations in each subspace with fixed atom number. The quantum correlations useful for atom interferometry are estimated using the quantum Fisher information. We identify the choice of parameters leading to the largest Fisher information, thereby showing that, for all kinds of loss processes, quantum correlations can be partially protected from decoherence when the losses are strongly asymmetric in the two modes.

abstract: We study the impact of dephasing on the excitation dynamics of a cloud of ultracold two-level Rydberg atoms for both resonant and off-resonant laser excitation, using the wave function Monte Carlo (MCWF) technique. We find that while for resonant laser driving, dephasing mainly leads to an increase of the Rydberg population and a decrease of the Mandel Q parameter, at off-resonant driving strong dephasing toggles between direct excitation of pairs of atoms and subsequent excitation of single atoms, respectively. These two excitation mechanisms can be directly quantified via the pair correlation function, which shows strong suppression of the two-photon resonance peak for strong dephasing. Consequently, qualitatively different dynamics arise in the excitation statistics for weak and strong dephasing in off-resonant excitation. Our findings show that time-resolved excitation number measurements can serve as a powerful tool to identify the dominating process in the system's excitation dynamics.

abstract: Electron correlations in molecules can be divided in short range dynamical correlations, long range Van der Waals type interactions and near degeneracy static correlations. In this work we analyze for a one-dimensional model of a two-electron system how these three types of correlations can be incorporated in a simple wave function of restricted functional form consisting of an orbital product multiplied by a single correlation function $f(r_{12})$ depending on the interelectronic distance $r_{12}$. Since the three types of correlations mentioned lead to different signatures in terms of the natural orbital (NO) amplitudes in two-electron systems we make an analysis of the wave function in terms of the NO amplitudes for a model system of a diatomic molecule. In our numerical implementation we fully optimize the orbitals and the correlation function on a spatial grid without restrictions on their functional form. Due to this particular form of the wave function, we can prove that none of the amplitudes vanishes and moreover that it displays a distinct sign pattern and a series of avoided crossings as a function of the bond distance in agreement with the exact solution. This shows that the wave function Ansatz correctly incorporates the long range Van der Waals interactions. We further show that the approximate wave function gives an excellent binding curve and is able to describe static correlations. We show that in order to do this the correlation function $f(r_{12})$ needs to diverge for large $r_{12}$ at large internuclear distances while for shorter bond distances it increases as a function of $r_{12}$ to a maximum value after which it decays exponentially. We further give a physical interpretation of this behavior.

abstract: Using the large-deviation formalism, we study the statistics of current fluctuations in a diffusive nonequilibrium quantum spin chain. The boundary-driven XX chain with dephasing consists of a coherent bulk hopping and a local dissipative dephasing. We analytically calculate the exact expression for the second current moment in a system of any length and then numerically demonstrate that in the thermodynamic limit higher-order cumulants and the large-deviation function can be calculated using the additivity principle or macroscopic hydrodynamic theory. This shows that the additivity principle can also hold in systems that are not purely stochastic, and can in particular be valid in quantum systems. We also show that in large systems the current fluctuations are the same as in the classical symmetric simple exclusion process.

abstract: Entanglement measures find frequent application in the study of topologically ordered systems, where the presence of topological order is reflected in an additional contribution to the entanglement of the system. Obtaining this topological entropy from analytical calculations or numerical simulations is generally difficult due to the fact that it is an order one correction to leading terms that scale with the size of the system. In order to distil the topological entropy, one resorts to extrapolation as a function of system size, or to clever subtraction schemes that allow to cancel out the leading terms. Both approaches have the disadvantage of requiring multiple (accurate) calculations of the entanglement of the system. Here we propose a modification of conventional entanglement calculations that allows to obtain the topological entropy of a system from a single measurement of entanglement. In our approach, we replace the conventional trace over the degrees of freedom of a partition of the system with a projection onto a given state (which needs not be known). We show that a proper choice of partition and projective measurement allows to rid the entanglement measures of the typical boundary terms, thus exposing the topological contribution alone. We consider specifically the measures known as von Neumann entropy and entanglement negativity, and we discuss their application to both models that exhibit quantum as well as classical topological order.

We suggest an efficient method for generating such modes and the local bounded potential that supports the BIC, based on the pioneering Wigner-von Neumann concept. It is shown that the bulk and surface embedded modes are structurally stable and that they decay faster than a power law at long distances from the mode center.

abstract: We present Lagrangian which implies both necessary constraints and dynamical equations for position and spin of relativistic spin one-half particle. The model is consistent for any value of magnetic moment $\mu$ and for arbitrary electromagnetic background. Our equations coincide with those of Frenkel in the approximation in which the latter have been obtained by Frenkel. Transition from approximate to exact equations yields two structural modifications of the theory. First, Frenkel condition on spin-tensor turns into the Pirani condition. Second, canonical momentum is no more proportional to velocity. Due to this, even when $\mu=1$ (Frenkel case), the complete and approximate equations predict different behavior of particle. The difference between momentum and velocity means extra contribution into spin-orbit interaction. To estimate the contribution, we found exact solution to complete equations for the case of uniform magnetic field. While Frenkel electron moves around the circle, our particle experiences magnetic {\it Zitterbewegung}, that is oscillates in the direction of magnetic field with amplitude of order of Compton wavelength for the fast particle. Besides, the particle has dipole electric moment.

abstract: Long-time atom interferometry is instrumental to various high-precision measurements of fundamental physical properties, including tests of the equivalence principle. Due to rotations and gravity gradients, the classical trajectories characterizing the motion of the wave packets for the two branches of the interferometer do not close in phase space, an effect which increases significantly with the interferometer time. The relative displacement between the interfering wave packets in such open interferometers leads to a fringe pattern in the density profile at each exit port and a loss of contrast in the oscillations of the integrated particle number as a function of the phase shift. Paying particular attention to gravity gradients, we present a simple mitigation strategy involving small changes in the timing of the laser pulses which is very easy to implement. A useful representation-free description of the state evolution in an atom interferometer is introduced and employed to analyze the loss of contrast and mitigation strategy in the general case. (As a by-product, a remarkably compact derivation of the phase-shift in a general light-pulse atom interferometer is provided.) Furthermore, exact results are obtained for (pure and mixed) Gaussian states which allow a simple interpretation in terms of the alignment of Wigner functions in phase-space. Analytical results are also obtained for expanding Bose-Einstein condensates within the time-dependent Thomas-Fermi approximation. Finally, a combined strategy for rotations and nonaligned gravity gradients is considered as well.

abstract: We study a voltage biased InAs double quantum dot (DQD) that is coupled to a superconducting transmission line resonator. Inelastic tunneling in the DQD is mediated by electron phonon coupling and coupling to the cavity mode. We show that electronic transport through the DQD leads to photon emission from the cavity at a rate of 10 MHz. With a small cavity drive field, we observe a gain of up to 15 in the cavity transmission. Our results are analyzed in the context of existing theoretical models and suggest that it may be necessary to account for inelastic tunneling processes that proceed via simultaneous emission of a phonon and a photon.

abstract: Several quantum gravity approaches and field theory on an evolving lattice involve a discretization changing dynamics generated by evolution moves. Local evolution moves in variational discrete systems (1) are a generalization of the Pachner evolution moves of simplicial gravity models, (2) update only a small subset of the dynamical data, (3) change the number of kinematical and physical degrees of freedom, and (4) generate a dynamical coarse graining or refining of the underlying discretization. To systematically explore such local moves and their implications in the quantum theory, this article suitably expands the quantum formalism for global evolution moves, constructed in a companion paper, by employing that global moves can be decomposed into sequences of local moves. This formalism is spelled out for systems with Euclidean configuration spaces. Various types of local moves, the different kinds of constraints generated by them, the constraint preservation and possible divergences in resulting state sums are discussed. It is shown that non-trivial local coarse graining moves entail a non-unitary projection of (physical) Hilbert spaces and `fine grained' Dirac observables defined on them. Identities for undoing a local evolution move with its (time reversed) inverse are derived. Finally, the implications of these results for a Pachner move generated dynamics in simplicial quantum gravity models are commented on.

abstract: We analyze a process of splitting of the Bose-Einstein condensate and the mutual coherence of two separated atomic clouds. Within the classical fields approximation we show that coherence between clouds is degraded if atoms interact and if we account for the sufficiently long observation time. We also show, that upon recombination, the coherence across the sample is restored. The coherence is not fully degraded if the splitting potential remains sufficiently penetrable. We calculate the variance of atom number difference for this time-averaging measurement and show that for low temperatures it can be well below Poissonian limit like it was observed in the experiments.

abstract: The possibility of using a quantum system to simulate another one has been recognized for a long time as an important research direction in quantum information and quantum computing. In Ref. [J. Li et. al, Nat. Commun. 4, 1420 (2013)], a superconducting circuit (a transmon) was employed to simulate a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) effect known as motional averaging. In this paper we analyze the results of numerical integration of the time evolution of the density matrix of a qubit with random frequency fluctuations, and compare the results with those obtained by using the method of quantum trajectories. We show that both methods produce equivalent results, although some differences may appear in the range of intermediate modulation frequencies.

abstract: When one of the parameters in the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion of a system is modulated, particles can be generated out of the quantum vacuum. This phenomenon is known as the dynamical Casimir effect, and it was recently realized experimentally in systems of superconducting circuits, for example by using modulated resonators made of coplanar waveguides, or arrays of superconducting quantum intereference devices (SQUIDs) forming a Josephson metamaterial. In this paper, we consider a simple electrical circuit model for dynamical Casimir effects, consisting of an LC resonator, with the inductor modulated externally at 10.8 GHz and with the resonant frequency tunable over a range of $\pm$ 400 MHz around 5.4 GHz. The circuit is analyzed classically using a circuit simulator (APLAC). We demonstrate that if an additional source of classical noise couples to the resonator (on top of the quantum vacuum), for example via dissipative "internal modes", then the resulting spectrum of the photons in the cavity will present two strongly asymmetric branches. However, according to the theory of the dynamical Casimir effect, these branches should be symmetric, a prediction which is confirmed by our experimental data. The simulation presented here therefore shows that the origin of the photons generated in our experiment with Josephson metamaterials is the quantum vacuum, and not a spurious classical noise source.

We conjecture that a similar procedure exists, which allows, starting from an arbitrary unitary matrix, to find a scaled matrix which is unitary and has all line sums equal to 1. The existence of such algorithm guarantees a powerful decomposition of an arbitrary quantum circuit.

abstract: We study a quench protocol that conserves the entanglement spectrum of a bipartition of a quantum system. As an example we consider the splitting of a critical Ising chain in two chains, and compare it with the well known case of joining of two chains. We show that both the out of equilibrium time evolution of global properties and the equilibrium regime after the quench of local properties are different in the two scenarios. Since the two quenches only differ in the presence/absence of the conservation of the entanglement spectrum, our results suggest that this conservation plays a fundamental role in both the out-of-equilibrium dynamics and the subsequent equilibration mechanism. We discuss the relevance of our results in the context of quantum simulators.

abstract: We propose a simple scheme for tomography of band-insulating states in one- and two-dimensional optical lattices with two sublattice states. In particular, the scheme maps out the Berry curvature in the entire Brillouin zone and extracts topological invariants such as the Chern number. The measurement relies on observing---via time-of-flight imaging---the time evolution of the momentum distribution following a sudden quench in the band structure. We consider two examples of experimental relevance: the Harper model with $\pi$-flux and the Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice. Moreover, we illustrate the performance of the scheme in the presence of a parabolic trap, noise, and finite measurement resolution.

abstract: $CPT$ groups for spinor fields in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces are defined in the framework of automorphism groups of Clifford algebras. It is shown that de Sitter spaces with mutually opposite signatures correspond to Clifford algebras with different algebraic structure that induces an essential difference of $CPT$ groups associated with these spaces. $CPT$ groups for charged particles are considered with respect to phase factors on the various spinor spaces related with real subalgebras of the simple Clifford algebra over the complex field (Dirac algebra). It is shown that $CPT$ groups for neutral particles which admit particle-antiparticle interchange and $CPT$ groups for truly neutral particles are described within semisimple Clifford algebras with quaternionic and real division rings, respectively. A difference between bosonic and fermionic $CPT$ groups is discussed.

abstract: This paper presents a detailed asymptotic study of the nonlinear differential equation y'(x)=\cos[\pi xy(x)] subject to the initial condition y(0)=a. Although the differential equation is nonlinear, the solutions to this initial-value problem bear a striking resemblance to solutions to the time-independent Schroedinger eigenvalue problem. As x increases from x=0, y(x) oscillates and thus resembles a quantum wave function in a classically allowed region. At a critical value x=x_{crit}, where x_{crit} depends on a, the solution y(x) undergoes a transition; the oscillations abruptly cease and y(x) decays to 0 monotonically as x-->\infty. This transition resembles the transition in a wave function that occurs at a turning point as one enters the classically forbidden region. Furthermore, the initial condition a falls into discrete classes; in the nth class of initial conditions a_{n-1}<a<a_n (n=1,2,3,...), y(x) exhibits exactly n maxima in the oscillatory region. The boundaries a_n of these classes are the analogs of quantum-mechanical eigenvalues. An asymptotic calculation of $a_n$ for large $n$ is analogous to a high-energy semiclassical (WKB) calculation of eigenvalues in quantum mechanics. The principal result of this paper is that as n-->\infty, a_n~A\sqrt{n}, where A=2^{5/6}. Numerical analysis reveals that the first Painleve transcendent has an eigenvalue structure that is quite similar to that of the equation y'(x)=\cos[\pi xy(x)] and that the nth eigenvalue grows with n like a constant times n^{3/5} as n-->\infty. Finally, it is noted that the constant A is numerically very close to the lower bound on the power-series constant P in the theory of complex variables, which is associated with the asymptotic behavior of zeros of partial sums of Taylor series.
