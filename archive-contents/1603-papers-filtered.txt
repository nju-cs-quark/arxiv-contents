abstract: Everetts Relative State Interpretation (aka Many Worlds Interpretation) has gained increasing interest due the progress understanding the role of decoherence. In order to fullfil its promise as an intellectually economic realistic description of the physical world, two postulates are formulated. In short they are 1) the system is described by $\psi(x)$ and its density $\rho(x)=\psi^*(x)\psi(x)$ gives the distribution of the localization of the system with the respect to the variable $x$; 2) an equation of motion for the state $i\hbar \partial_t \psi = H\psi$. The quantum probabilities (Born's rule) is easily derived from the new postulates, as well as other parts of the traditional postulates.

abstract: Anderson localisation is an important phenomenon arising in many areas of physics, and here we explore it in the context of quantum information devices. Finite dimensional spin chains have been demonstrated to be important devices for quantum information transport, and in particular can be engineered to allow for "perfect state transfer" (PST). Here we present extensive investigations of disordered PST spin chains, demonstrating spatial localisation and transport retardation effects, and relate these effects to conventional Anderson localisation. We provide thresholds for Anderson localisation in these finite quantum information systems for both the spatial and the transport domains. Finally, we consider the effect of disorder on the eigenstate spectrum of our Hamiltonian, where results support our conclusions on the presence of Anderson localisation.

abstract: The staggered quantum walk model allows to establish an unprecedented connection between discrete-time quantum walks and graph theory. We call attention to the fact that a large subclass of the coined model is included in Szegedy's model, which in its turn is entirely included in the staggered model. In order to compare those three quantum walk models, we put them in the staggered formalism and we show that the Szegedy and coined models are defined on a special subclass of graphs. This inclusion scheme is also true when the searching framework is added. We use graph theory to characterize which staggered quantum walks can be reduced to the Szegedy or coined quantum walk model. We analyze a staggered-based search that cannot be included in Szegedy's model and we show numerically that this search is more efficient than a random-walk-based search.

abstract: We analyse the performance of two quantum-state-transfer Hamiltonians in the presence of diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, and in terms of different measures. The first Hamiltonian pertains to a fully-engineered chain and the second to a chain with modified boundary couplings. The task is to find which Hamiltonian is the most robust to given levels of disorder and irrespective of the input state. In this respect, it is shown that the performance of the two protocols are approximately equivalent.

abstract: Using a polaron master equation approach we investigate the resonance fluorescence spectra from coherently driven quantum dots (QDs) coupled to an acoustic phonon bath and a photonic crystal waveguide with a rich local density of photon states (LDOS). Resonance fluorescence spectra from QDs in semiconductor crystals are known to show strong signatures of electron-phonon interactions, but when coupled to a structured photonic reservoir, the QD emission properties are also determined by the frequency dependence of the LDOS of the photon reservoir. Here, we investigate the simultaneous role of coupled photon and phonon baths on the characteristic Mollow triplet spectra from a strongly driven QD. As an example structured photonic reservoir, we first study a photonic crystal coupled cavity waveguide, and find that photons and phonons have counter-interacting effects near the upper mode-edge of the coupled-cavity waveguide, thus establishing the importance of their separate roles in determining the emission spectra. The general theory is developed for arbitrary photonic reservoirs and is further applied to determine resonance the fluorescence spectra from a realistic, disordered W1 photonic crystal waveguide showing important photon-phonon interaction effects that are directly relevant to emerging experiments and theoretical proposals.

abstract: Photonic crystals provide an extremely powerful toolset for manipulation of optical dispersion and density of states, and have thus been employed for applications from photon generation to quantum sensing with NVs and atoms. The unique control afforded by these media make them a beautiful, if unexplored, playground for strong coupling quantum electrodynamics, where a single, highly nonlinear emitter hybridizes with the band structure of the crystal. In this work we demonstrate that such hybridization can create localized cavity modes that live within the photonic band-gap, whose localization and spectral properties we explore in detail. We then demonstrate that the coloured vacuum of the photonic crystal can be employed for efficient dissipative state preparation. This work opens exciting prospects for engineering long-range spin models in the circuit QED architecture, as well as new opportunities for dissipative quantum state engineering.

abstract: Quantum walks are a promising framework that can be used to both understand and implement quantum information processing tasks. The quantum stochastic walk is a recently developed framework that combines the concept of a quantum walk with that of a classical random walk, through open system evolution of a quantum system. Quantum stochastic walks have been shown to have applications in as far reaching fields as artificial intelligence. However, there are significant constraints on the kind of open system evolutions that can be realized in a physical experiment. In this work, we discuss the restrictions on the allowed open system evolution, and the physical assumptions underpinning them. We show that general implementations would require the complete solution of the underlying unitary dynamics, and sophisticated reservoir engineering, thus weakening the benefits of experimental investigations.

abstract: As an unusual type of anomalous diffusion behavior, (transient) superballistic transport is not well understood but it has been experimentally observed recently. We here calculate the white noise effect (in Markov approximation) on the quantum diffusion in 1D tight-binding model with disordered and quasi-periodic region of size L attached to perfect lattices at both ends. Here we show the effect of white noise on spreading of the wave packet initially located at the center of the sublattice. We find threshold values of the white noise strength, beyond which the quantum hyperdiffusion does not occur. We predict from our numerical studies that the quantum hyperdiffusion exponent can be tuned by the strength of applied white noise. Therefore we can manually apply noise to a system to drive it to desired diffusion rate.

abstract: The concept of flat band plays an important role in strongly-correlated many-body physics. However, the demonstration of the flat band physics is highly nontrivial due to intrinsic limitations in conventional condensed matter materials. Here we propose a circuit quantum electrodynamics simulator of the 2D Lieb lattice exhibiting a flat middle band. By exploiting the simple parametric conversion method, we design a photonic Lieb lattice with \textit{in situ} tunable hopping strengths in a 2D array of coupled superconducting transmissionline resonators. Moreover, the flexibility of our proposal enables the immediate incorporation of both the artificial gauge field and the strong photon-photon interaction in a time- and site-resolved manner. To unambiguously demonstrate the synthesized flat band, we further investigate the observation of the flat band localization of microwave photons through the pumping and the steady-state measurements of only few sites on the lattice. Requiring only current level of technique and being robust against imperfections in realistic circuits, our scheme can be readily tested in experiments and may pave a new way towards the future realization of exotic photonic quantum Hall fluids including anomalous quantum Hall effect and bosonic fractional quantum Hall states without magnetic fields.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1603.05003
abstract: We analyze the asymptotic scaling of persistence of unvisited sites for quantum walks on a line. In contrast to the classical random walk there is no connection between the behaviour of persistence and the scaling of variance. In particular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an inverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin parameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks containing the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two contributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to the asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the trapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the two-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay constant of the exponential decay depend also on the initial coin state and its coherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering the initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse power-law behaviour.

abstract: We show that the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological insulators can be modified in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We consider a one-dimensional tight-binding model with gain and loss as well as long-range hopping. The system is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that encircles an exceptional point in momentum space. The winding number has a fractional value of 1/2. There is only one dynamically stable zero-energy edge state due to the defectiveness of the Hamiltonian. This edge state is robust to disorder due to protection by a chiral symmetry. We also discuss experimental realization with arrays of coupled resonator optical waveguides.

abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks and adiabatic quantum evolution are two general techniques for quantum computing, both of which are described by Hamiltonians that govern their evolutions by Schr\"odinger's equation. In the former, the Hamiltonian is fixed, while in the latter, the Hamiltonian varies with time. As a result, their formulations of Grover's algorithm evolve differently through Hilbert space. We show that this difference is fundamental; they cannot be made to evolve along each other's path without introducing structure more powerful than the standard oracle for unstructured search. For an adiabatic quantum evolution to evolve like the quantum walk search algorithm, it must interpolate between three fixed Hamiltonians, one of which is complex and introduces structure that is stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Conversely, for a quantum walk to evolve along the path of the adiabatic search algorithm, it must be a chiral quantum walk on a weighted, directed star graph with structure that is also stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Thus the two techniques, although similar in being described by Hamiltonians that govern their evolution, compute by fundamentally irreconcilable means.

abstract: When searching for a marked vertex in a graph, Szegedy's usual search operator is defined by using the transition probability matrix of the random walk with absorbing barriers at the marked vertices. Instead of using this operator, we analyze searching with Szegedy's quantum walk by using reflections around the marked vertices, that is, queries. We show we can boost the probability to 1 of finding a marked vertex in the complete graph. Numerical simulations suggests that the success probability can be improved for other graphs, like the two-dimensional grid. We also prove that, for a certain class of graphs, we can express Szegedy's search operator, obtained from the absorbing walk, using the query model.

abstract: $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, that is, a combined parity and time-reversal symmetry is a key milestone for non-Hermite systems exhibiting entirely real eigenenergy. In the present work, motivated by a recent experiment, we study $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum walks. We present the explicit definition of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry by employing a concept of symmetry time frames. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition so that the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum walks retains $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry even when parameters of the model depend on position. It is also shown that there exist extra symmetries embedded in the time-evolution operator. Applying these results, we clarify that the non-unitary quantum walk in the experiment does have $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.

abstract: In analogy with usual Anderson localization taking place in time-independent disordered quantum systems where the disorder acts in configuration space, systems exposed to temporally disordered potentials can display Anderson localization in the time domain. We demonstrate this phenomenon with one-dimensional examples where a temporally disordered potential induces localization during the quantum evolution of wave-packets, in contrast with a fully delocalized classical dynamics. This is an example of a time crystal phenomenon, i.e., a crystalline behavior in the time domain.

abstract: We investigated discrete time quantum walks with an arbitrary initial state $\mid\Psi_{0}(\theta,\phi,\varphi)\rangle=\cos\theta e^{i\phi}\mid0L\rangle+\sin\theta e^{i\varphi}\mid0R\rangle$ with a U(2) coin $U(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. We discover that the average position $\bar{x}=\max(\bar{x})\cos(\alpha+\gamma+\phi-\varphi)$, with coin operator $U(\alpha,\pi/4,\gamma)$ and initial state $\mid\Phi_{0}(\pi/4,\phi,\varphi)\rangle=(e^{i\phi}\mid0L\rangle+e^{i\varphi}\mid0R\rangle)\sqrt{2}/2$. If we set initial state and coin operator to $\mid\Phi_{0}\rangle(\theta,\pi/2,0)=i\cos\theta\mid0L\rangle+\sin\theta\mid0R\rangle)$ and coin operator $U(0,\pi/4,0)$, for $\alpha+\gamma+\phi-\varphi=\pi/2$, we discover that $\bar{x}=-\max(\bar{x})\cos(2\theta).$ Last we verify the result above, and obtain the summarize properties of quantum walks with an arbitrary state. We get that $\bar{x}(\theta,\phi,\varphi,\alpha,\beta,\gamma,t)=\cos2\theta*\bar{x}_{|0L\rangle}(\beta,t)+\sin2\theta*\cos(\alpha+\gamma+\phi-\varphi)*\bar{x}_{(\mid0L\rangle+\mid0R\rangle)\sqrt{2}/2}(\alpha=\gamma=0,\beta,t)$. If the average positions $\bar{x}$ with initial state $|0L\rangle$ and $\mid\Psi_{0}\rangle=(\mid0L\rangle+\mid0R\rangle)\sqrt{2}/2$ and coin operator $U(0,\beta,0)$ are known, we can get the average position result of quantum walks with an arbitrary initial state and a U(2) coin operator.

abstract: In this paper we consider quantum walks whose evolution converges to the Dirac equation one in the limit of small wave-vectors. We show exact Fast Fourier implementation of the Dirac quantum walks in one, two and three space dimensions. The behaviour of particle states, defined as states smoothly peaked in some wave-vector eigenstate of the walk, is described by an approximated dispersive differential equation that for small wave-vectors gives the usual Dirac particle and antiparticle kinematics. The accuracy of the approximation is provided in terms of a lower bound on the fidelity between the exactly evolved state and the approximated one. The jittering of the position operator expectation value for states having both a particle and an antiparticle component is analytically derived and observed in the numerical implementations.

abstract: We observe and study the phenomenon of Anderson localization in a system of true quantum kicked rotors. Nitrogen molecules in a supersonic molecular jet are cooled down to 27~K and are rotationally excited by a periodic train of 24~high-intensity femtosecond pulses. Exponential distribution of the molecular angular momentum - the most unambiguous signature of Anderson localization - is measured directly by means of coherent Raman scattering. We demonstrate the suppressed growth of the molecular rotational energy with the number of laser kicks and study the dependence of the localization length on the kick strength. Both timing and amplitude noise in the pulse train is shown to destroy the localization and revive the diffusive growth of angular momentum.

abstract: Quantum walks (QWs) describe particles evolving coherently on a lattice. The internal degree of freedom corresponds to a Hilbert space, called coin system. We consider QWs on Cayley graphs of some group $G$. In the literature, investigations concerning infinite $G$ have been focused on graphs corresponding to $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$ with coin system of dimension 2, whereas for one-dimensional coin (so called scalar QWs) only the case of finite $G$ has been studied. Here we prove that the evolution of a scalar QW with $G$ infinite Abelian is trivial, providing a thorough classification of this kind of walks. Then we consider the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$, that is the unique non-Abelian group $G$ containing a subgroup $H\cong\mathbb{Z}$ with two cosets. We characterize the class of QWs on the Cayley graphs of $D_\infty$ and, via a coarse-graining technique, we show that it coincides with the class of spinorial walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ which satisfies parity symmetry. This class of QWs includes the Weyl and the Dirac QWs. Remarkably, there exist also spinorial walks that are not coarse-graining of a scalar QW, such as the Hadamard walk.

abstract: Topological quantum error correction codes are currently among the most promising candidates for efficiently dealing with the decoherence effects inherently present in quantum devices. Numerically, their theoretical error threshold can be calculated by mapping the underlying quantum problem to a related classical statistical-mechanical spin system with quenched disorder. Here, we present results for the general fault-tolerant regime, where we consider both qubit and measurement errors. However, unlike in previous studies, here we vary the strength of the different error sources independently. Our results highlight peculiar differences between toric and color codes. This study complements previous results published in New J. Phys. 13, 083006 (2011).

abstract: An upgraded concept of solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger-type equations is proposed. In a broader methodical context of non-perturbative quantum theory the innovation involves potentials which are piece-wise analytic yielding differential equations solvable in terms of special functions. In our illustrative example, Whittaker functions are employed and a single point of non-analyticity is admitted in the origin. In a symbolic-manipulation-based practical implementation of the method a serendipitous advantage of the construction of bound states is found in the both-sided nature of the numerical localization of their energies.

abstract: The behaviour of fermions in the background of a double-step potential is analyzed with a general mixing of scalar and vector couplings via continuous chiral-conjugation transformation. Provided the vector coupling does not exceed the scalar coupling, a Sturm-Liouville approaching for the double-step potential shows that the transmission coefficient exhibits oscillations and that a finite set of intrinsically relativistic bound-state solutions might appear as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling regime. An isolated bound-state solution resulting from coupled first-order equations might also come into sight. It is also shown that all those possible bound solutions disappear asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the realization of the so-called spin and pseudospin symmetries in a four-dimensional space-time. Furthermore, we show that due to the additional mass acquired by the fermion from the scalar background the high localization of the fermion in an extreme relativistic regime does not violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

abstract: Symmetries play a crucial role in ubiquitous systems found in Nature. In this work, we propose an elegant approach to detect symmetries by measuring quantum currents. Our detection scheme relies on initiating the system in an anti-symmetric initial condition, with respect to the symmetric sites, and using a probe that acts like a local noise. Depending on the position of the probe the currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau indicating the presence of meta-stability and multi-exponential decays in case of multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive to the probe and vanish completely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much longer than the timescale of the probe. These results are demonstrated using a $4$-site model and an archetypal example of the para-benzene ring and are shown to be robust under a weak disorder.

abstract: We analyze the temporal response of the fluorescence light that is emitted from a dense gas of cold atoms driven by a laser. When the average interatomic distance is smaller than the wavelength of the photons scattered by the atoms, the system exhibits strong dipolar interactions and collective dissipation. We solve the exact dynamics of small systems with different geometries and show how these collective features are manifest in the scattered light properties such as the photon emission rate, the power spectrum and the second-order correlation function. By calculating these quantities beyond the weak driving limit, we make progress in understanding the signatures of collective behavior in these many-body systems. Furthermore, we clarify the role of disorder on the resonance fluorescence, of direct relevance for recent experimental efforts that aim at the exploration of many-body effects in dipole-dipole interacting gases of atoms.

abstract: Disordered quantum networks, as those describing light-harvesting complexes, are often characterized by the presence of peripheral ring-like structures, where the excitation is initialized, and inner reaction centers (RC), where the excitation is trapped. The peripheral rings display coherent features: their eigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant states. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of disorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC, while the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states, creating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal transfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder strength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level system. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial condition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an excitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of the order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the initial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the superradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the superradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC energy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an optimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the superradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap. The presence of dynamical noise, which induces dephasing and decoherence, affects the resonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional 'incoherent' resonance peak, which corresponds to the RC energy being equal to the energy of the superradiant state.

abstract: We investigate the statistics of the first detected passage time of a quantum walk. The postulates of quantum theory, in particular the collapse of the wave function upon measurement, reveal an intimate connection between the wave function of a process free of measurements, i.e. the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, and the statistics of first detection events on a site. For stroboscopic measurements a quantum renewal equation yields basic properties of quantum walks. For example, for a tight binding model on a ring we discover critical sampling times, diverging quantities such as the mean time for first detection, and an optimal detection rate. For a quantum walk on an infinite line the probability of first detection decays like $(\mbox{time})^{-3}$ with a superimposed oscillation, critical behavior for a specific choice of sampling time, and vanishing amplitude when the sampling time approaches zero due to the quantum Zeno effect.

Here we demonstrate measurement times exceeding $10^5$ seconds and zeptonewton force sensitivity with laser-cooled silica nanospheres trapped in an optical lattice. The sensitivity achieved exceeds that of conventional room-temperature solid-state force sensors, and enables a variety of applications including electric field sensing, inertial sensing, and gravimetry. The optical potential allows the particle to be confined in a number of possible trapping sites, with precise localization at the anti-nodes of the optical standing wave. By studying the motion of a particle which has been moved to an adjacent trapping site, the known spacing of the lattice anti-nodes can be used to calibrate the displacement spectrum of the particle. Finally, we study the dependence of the trap stability and lifetime on the laser intensity and gas pressure, and examine the heating rate of the particle in high vacuum in the absence of optical feedback cooling.

abstract: We propose to control light trapping in a large ensemble of cold atoms by an external, static magnetic field. For an appropriate choice of frequency and polarization of the exciting pulse, the field is expected to speed up the fluorescence of a dilute atomic system but can significantly slow it down in a dense ensemble. The slowing down of fluorescence is due to the excitation of spatially localized collective atomic states that appear only under a strong magnetic field and have exponentially long lifetimes. The control of fluorescence by the magnetic field may be of interest for use in future quantum-information processing devices. It also paves a way towards the experimental observation of the disorder-induced localization of light in cold atomic systems.

abstract: The localization of the valence electron of $H$, $Li$ and $Na$ atoms enclosed by three different fullerene molecules is studied. The structure of the fullerene molecules is used to calculate the equilibrium position of the endohedrally atom as the minimum of the classical $(N+1)$-body Lennard-Jones potential. Once the position of the guest atom is determined, the fullerene cavity is modeled by a short range attractive shell according to molecule symmetry, and the enclosed atom is modeled by an effective one-electron potential. In order to examine whether the endohedral compound is formed by a neutral atom inside a neutral fullerene molecule $X@C_{N}$ or if the valence electron of the encapsulated atom localizes in the fullerene giving rise to a state with the form $X^{+}@C_{N}^{-}$, we analyze the electronic density, the projections onto free atomic states, and the weights of partial angular waves.

abstract: We consider the quantum centipede made of $N$ fermionic quantum walkers on the one-dimensional lattice interacting by means of the simplest of all hard-bound constraints: the distance between two consecutive fermions is either one or two lattice spacings. This composite quantum walker spreads ballistically, just as the simple quantum walk. However, because of the interactions between the internal degrees of freedom, the distribution of its center-of-mass velocity displays numerous ballistic fronts in the long-time limit, corresponding to singularities in the empirical velocity distribution. The spectrum of the centipede and the corresponding group velocities are analyzed by direct means for the first few values of $N$. Some analytical results are obtained for arbitrary $N$ by exploiting an exact mapping of the problem onto a free-fermion system. We thus derive the maximal velocity describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the centipede wavefunction, including its non-trivial value in the large-$N$ limit.

abstract: This study investigates unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional quantum walks. We prove that one-dimensional quantum walks are unitary equivalent to quantum walks of Ambainis type and that translation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walks are Szegedy walks. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition for a one-dimensional quantum walk to be a Szegedy walk.

abstract: In this letter we explore how the microscopic dynamics of charge transfer (CT) excitons are influenced by the presence of an external magnetic field in disordered molecular semiconductors. This influence is driven by the dynamic interplay between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom of the electron-hole pair. To account for this interplay we have developed a numerical framework that combines a traditional model of quantum spin dynamics with a coarse-grained model of stochastic charge transport. This combination provides a general and efficient methodology for simulating the effects of magnetic field on CT state dynamics, therefore providing a basis for revealing the microscopic origin of experimentally observed magnetic field effects. We demonstrate that simulations carried out on our model are capable of reproducing experimental results as well as generating theoretical predictions related to the efficiency of organic electronic materials.
