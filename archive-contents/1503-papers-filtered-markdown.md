**1.    A Simple Method for Finding the Scattering Coefficients of Quantum Graphs**  
Seth S. Cottrell  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00253  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are roughly analogous to classical random walks, and like classical walks they have been used to find new (quantum) algorithms. When studying the behavior of large graphs or combinations of graphs it is useful to find the response of a subgraph to signals of different frequencies. In so doing we can replace an entire subgraph with a single vertex with frequency dependent scattering coefficients. In this paper a simple technique for quickly finding the scattering coefficients of any quantum graph will be presented. These scattering coefficients can be expressed entirely in terms of the characteristic polynomial of the graph's time step operator. Moreover, with these in hand we can easily derive the "impulse response" which is the key to predicting the response of a graph to any signal. This gives us a powerful set of tools for rapidly understanding the behavior of graphs or for reducing a large graph into its constituent subgraphs regardless of how they are connected.

**2.    Properties of long quantum random walks in one and two dimensions**  
Hao Luo, Peng Xue, and B. Normand  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06293  
<blockquote>
<p>
The quantum random walk (QRW) is the term given to a family of algorithms governing the evolution of a discrete quantum system and as such has a founding role in the study of quantum computation. We contribute to the investigation of QRW phenomena by performing a detailed numerical study of discrete-time quantum walks. In one dimension (1D), we compute the structure of the probability distribution, which is not a smooth curve but shows oscillatory features on all length scales. By analyzing walks up to $N = 1000000$ steps, we discuss the scaling characteristics and limiting forms of the QRW in both real and Fourier space. In 2D, with a view to ready experimental realization, we consider two types of QRW, one based on a four-faced coin and the other on sequential flipping of a single two-faced coin. We show analytically and numerically that both QRWs may be generated using two two-faced coins, which in the first case are completely unentangled and in the second are maximally entangled. We draw on our 1D results to characterize the properties of both walks, demonstrating maximal speed-up and emerging semi-classical behavior in the maximally entangled QRW. We discuss existing and proposed experiments realizing these phenomena.

**3.    Quantum Walk Search through Potential Barriers**  
Thomas G. Wong  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06605  
<blockquote>
<p>
A randomly walking quantum particle searches for a marked vertex on the complete graph of $N$ vertices in Grover's $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ steps. This assumes that the particle can transition from one vertex to another, unhindered. Physically, however, it may need to tunnel through a potential barrier, perhaps due to an imperfect or non-ideal implementation of the walk. Then the particle has some amplitude of correctly hopping and some amplitude of staying put. We show that this causes the search to fail when the particle stays put with amplitude that scales greater than $1/\sqrt{N}$, so searching larger "databases" requires increasingly reliable hop operations. This condition also holds for search by continuous-time quantum walk.

**4.    Complexity of the XY antiferromagnet at fixed magnetization**  
Andrew M. Childs, David Gosset, Zak Webb  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07083  
<blockquote>
<p>
We prove that approximating the ground energy of the antiferromagnetic XY model on a simple graph at fixed magnetization (given as part of the instance specification) is QMA-complete. To show this, we strengthen a previous result by establishing QMA-completeness for approximating the ground energy of the Bose-Hubbard model on simple graphs. Using a connection between the XY and Bose-Hubbard models that we exploited in previous work, this establishes QMA-completeness of the XY model.

**5.    Two-walker discrete-time quantum walks on the line with percolation**  
Luca Rigovacca, Carlo Di Franco  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07113  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the behavior of two particles performing a quantum walk on the line when the possibility of having missing links is considered. We investigate two regimes, statical and dynamical percolation, that correspond to different time scales for the imperfections evolution with respect to the quantum walk evolution. We analyze how the (quantum) nature of the particles changes the output probabilities, and discuss the reasons giving rise to these differences.

**6.    Quantum walks in synthetic gauge fields with 3D integrated photonics**  
Octavi Boada, Leonardo Novo, Fabio Sciarrino, Yasser Omar  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07172  
<blockquote>
<p>
There is great interest in designing photonic devices capable of disorder-resistant transport and information processing. In this work we propose to exploit 3D integrated photonic circuits for the realization of 2D discrete-time quantum walks in a background synthetic gauge field, for both the single and many walker case. The gauge fields are generated by introducing the appropriate phase shifts between waveguides. Polarization-independent phase shifts lead to an Abelian or magnetic field, a case we describe in detail. We characterize the single-particle Abelian quantum walk, finding that in the presence of disorder the magnetic field enhances transport due to the presence of topologically protected chiral edge states which do not localize. Polarization-dependent phase shifts lead to effective non-Abelian gauge fields, which could be adopted to realize of Rashba-like quantum walks with spin-orbit coupling. Our work introduces a flexible platform for the experimental study of multi-particle quantum walks in the presence of synthetic gauge fields, which paves the way towards topologically robust transport of many-body states of photons.

**7.    Quantum tight-binding chains with dissipative coupling**  
D. Mogilevtsev, G. Ya. Slepyan, E. Garusov, S. Kilin, N. Korolkova  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07213  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a one-dimensional tight-binding chain of two-level systems coupled only through common dissipative Markovian reservoirs. This quantum chain can demonstrate anomalous thermodynamic behavior contradicting Fourier law. Population dynamics of individual systems of the chain is polynomial with the order determined by the initial state of the chain. The chain can simulate classically hard problems, such as multi-dimensional random walks.
