<blockquote>
<p>
Waves fail to propagate in random media. First predicted for quantum particles in the presence of a disordered potential, Anderson localization has been observed also in classical acoustics, electromagnetism and optics. Here, for the first time, we report the observation of Anderson localization of pairs of entangled photons in a two-particle discrete quantum walk a?ected by position dependent disorder. A quantum walk on a disordered lattice is realized by an integrated array of interferometers fabricated in glass by femtosecond laser writing. A novel technique is used to introduce a controlled phase shift into each unit mesh of the network. Polarization entanglement is exploited to simulate the di?erent symmetries of the two-walker system. We are thus able to experimentally investigate the genuine effect of (bosonic and fermionic) statistics in the absence of interaction between the particles. We will show how different types of randomness and the symmetry of the wave-function affect the localization of the entangled walkers.

**2.    Comparative investigation of the freezing phenomena for quantum correlations under nondissipative decoherence**

Phys. Rev. A 88, 012120 (2013)

<blockquote>
<p>
We show that the phenomenon of frozen discord, exhibited by specific classes of two-qubit states under local nondissipative decoherent evolutions, is a common feature of all known bona fide measures of general quantum correlations. All those measures, despite inducing typically inequivalent orderings on the set of nonclassically correlated states, return a constant value in the considered settings. Every communication protocol which relies on quantum correlations as resource will run with a performance completely unaffected by noise in the specified dynamical conditions. We provide a geometric interpretation of this

**3.    Differential Evolution for Many-Particle Adaptive Quantum Metrology**  
Neil B. Lovett, C��cile Crosnier, Mart�� Perarnau-Llobet, Barry C. Sanders  
Physical Review Letters 110, 220501 (2013)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2246  
<blockquote>
<p>
We devise powerful algorithms based on differential evolution for adaptive many-particle quantum metrology. Our new approach delivers adaptive quantum metrology policies for feedback control that are orders-of-magnitude more efficient and surpass the few-dozen-particle limitation arising in methods based on particle-swarm optimization. We apply our method to the binary-decision-tree model for quantum-enhanced phase estimation as well as to a new problem: a decision tree for adaptive estimation of the unknown bias of a quantum coin in a quantum walk and show how this latter case can be realized experimentally.

**4.    Unveiling and exemplifying the unitary equivalence of discrete time quantum walk models**  
B F Venancio, F M Andrade, M G E da Luz  
Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 46, 165302 (2013)

<blockquote>
<p>
The two major discrete time formulations for quantum walks, coined and scattering, are unitarily equivalent for arbitrary position dependent transition amplitudes and any topology (PRA {\bf 80}, 052301 (2009)). Although the proof explicit describes the mapping obtention, its high technicality may hinder relevant physical aspects involved in the equivalence. Discussing concrete examples -- the most general constructions for the line, square and honeycomb lattices -- here we unveil the similarities and differences of these two versions of quantum walks. We moreover show how to derive the dynamics of one from the other by means of proper projections. We perform calculations for different probability amplitudes like, Hadamard, Grover, Discrete Fourier Transform and the uncommon in the area (but interesting) Discrete Hartley Transform, comparing the evolutions. Our study illustrates the models interplay, an important issue for implementations and applications of such systems.

**5.    Easy and hard functions for the Boolean hidden shift problem**  
Andrew M. Childs, Robin Kothari, Maris Ozols, Martin Roetteler  
Proceedings of TQC 2013, LIPIcs, vol. 22, pp. 50-79, ISBN 978-3-939897-55-2 (2013)

<blockquote>
<p>
We study the quantum query complexity of the Boolean hidden shift problem. Given oracle access to f(x+s) for a known Boolean function f, the task is to determine the n-bit string s. The quantum query complexity of this problem depends strongly on f. We demonstrate that the easiest instances of this problem correspond to bent functions, in the sense that an exact one-query algorithm exists if and only if the function is bent. We partially characterize the hardest instances, which include delta functions. Moreover, we show that the problem is easy for random functions, since two queries suffice. Our algorithm for random functions is based on performing the pretty good measurement on several copies of a certain state; its analysis relies on the Fourier transform. We also use this approach to improve the quantum rejection sampling approach to the Boolean hidden shift problem.
