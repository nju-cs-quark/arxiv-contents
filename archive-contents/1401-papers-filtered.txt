abstract: A simple coined quantum walk in one dimension can be characterized by a $SU(2)$ operator with three parameters which represents the coin toss. However, different such coin toss operators lead to equivalent dynamics of the quantum walker. In this manuscript we present the unitary equivalence classes of quantum walks and show that all the nonequivalent quantum walks can be distinguished by a single parameter. Moreover, we argue that the electric quantum walks are equivalent to quantum walks with time dependent coin toss operator.

abstract: Quantum walks exhibit many unique characteristics compared to classical random walks. In the classical setting, self-avoiding random walks have been studied as a variation on the usual classical random walk. Classical self-avoiding random walks have found numerous applications, most notably in the modeling of protein folding. We consider the analogous problem in the quantum setting. We complement a quantum walk with a memory register that records where the walker has previously resided. The walker is then able to avoid returning back to previously visited sites. We parameterise the strength of the memory recording and the strength of the memory back-action on the walker's motion, and investigate their effect on the dynamics of the walk. We find that by manipulating these parameters the walk can be made to reproduce ideal quantum or classical random walk statistics, or a plethora of more elaborate diffusive phenomena. In some parameter regimes we observe a close correspondence between classical self-avoiding random walks and the quantum self-avoiding walk.

abstract: We describe an efficient way for measuring the concurrence of the hyperentanglement. In this protocol, the hyperentangled state is encoded in both polarization and momentum degrees of freedom. We show that the concurrences of both polarization and momentum entanglement can be conversed into the total success probability of picking up the odd-parity state and can be measured directly. This protocol requires the weak cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct the quantum nondemolition measurement and does not resort to the sophisticated controlled-not gate operation. It is feasible in current experimental technology.

abstract: We present two efficient schemes which can simultaneously accomplish hyperentanglement concentration and purification for two-photon four-qubit systems in an unknown partially hyperentangled mixed states. The first can correct errors in the polarization entanglement and extract maximal hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial mode with additional partial frequency entanglement. The second uses additional maximal frequency entanglement to purify and concentrate hyperentanglement in polarization and spatial mode deterministically. Both of the two schemes are only based on existing optical devices and cross-Kerr nonlinearities.

abstract: We investigate the time evolution of the chirality reduced density matrix for a discrete-time quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice, which is obtained by tracing out the spatial degree of freedom. We analyze the standard case, without decoherence, and the situation where decoherence appears in the form of broken links in the lattice. By examining the trace distance for possible pairs of initial states as a function of time, we conclude that the evolution of the reduced density matrix is non-Markovian, in the sense defined in [H. P. Breuer, E. M. Laine, and J. Piilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)]. As the level of noise increases, the dynamics approaches a Markovian process. The highest non-Markovianity corresponds to the case without decoherence. The reduced density matrix tends always to a well-defined limit that we calculate, but only in the decoherence-free case this limit is non-trivial.

abstract: Open quantum walks (OQW) are formulated as quantum Markov chains on graphs. It is shown that OQWs are a very useful tool for the formulation of dissipative quantum computing algorithms and for dissipative quantum state preparation. In particular, single qubit gates and the CNOT-gate are implemented as OQWs on fully connected graphs. Also, dissipative quantum state preparation of arbitrary single qubit states and of all two-qubit Bell-states is demonstrated. Finally, the discrete time version of dissipative quantum computing is shown to be more efficient if formulated in the language of OQWs.

abstract: Quantum walks on graphs can model physical processes and serve as efficient tools in quantum information theory. Once we admit random variations in the connectivity of the underlying graph, we arrive at the problem of percolation, where the long-time behaviour appears untreatable with direct numerical methods. We develop novel analytic methods based on the theory of random unitary operations which help us to determine explicitly the asymptotic dynamics of quantum walks on 2D finite integer lattices with percolation. Based on this theory we find new unexpected features of percolated walks like asymptotic position inhomogeneity or special directional symmetry breaking.

abstract: We demonstrate a coined quantum walk over ten steps in a one-dimensional network of linear optical elements. By applying single-point phase defects, the translational symmetry of an ideal standard quantum walk is broken resulting in localization effect in a quantum walk architecture. We furthermore investigate how the level of phase due to single-point phase defects and coin settings influence the strength of the localization signature.

abstract: An open quantum walk formalism for dissipative quantum computing is presented. The approach is illustrated with the examples of the Toffoli gate and the Quantum Fourier Transform for 3 and 4 qubits. It is shown that the algorithms based on the open quantum walk formalism are more efficient than the canonical dissipative quantum computing approach. In particular, the open quantum walks can be designed to converge faster to the desired steady state and to increase the probability of detection of the outcome of the computation.

abstract: We propose a twisted Szegedy walk for estimating the limit behavior of a discrete-time quantum walk on a crystal lattice, an infinite abelian covering graph, whose notion was introduced by [14]. First, we show that the spectrum of the twisted Szegedy walk on the quotient graph can be expressed by mapping the spectrum of a twisted random walk onto the unit circle. Secondly, we show that the spatial Fourier transform of the twisted Szegedy walk on a finite graph with appropriate parameters becomes the Grover walk on its infinite abelian covering graph. Finally, as an application, we show that if the Betti number of the quotient graph is strictly greater than one, then localization is ensured with some appropriated initial state. We also compute the limit density function for the Grover walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with flip flop shift, which implies the coexistence of linear spreading and localization. We partially obtain the abstractive shape of the limit density function: the support is within the $d$-dimensional sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{d}$, and $2^d$ singular points reside on the sphere's surface.

abstract: We consider the representation of a continuous-time quantum walk in a graph $X$ by the matrix $\exp(itA(X))$. We provide necessary and sufficient criteria for distance-regular graphs and, more generally, for graphs in association schemes to have perfect state transfer. Using these conditions, we provide several new examples of perfect state transfer in simple graphs.

abstract: One-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks show a rich spectrum of topological phases that have so far been exclusively analysed in momentum space. In this work we introduce an alternative approach to topology which is based on the scattering matrix of a quantum walk, adapting concepts from time-independent systems. For gapped quantum walks, topological invariants at quasienergies 0 and {\pi} probe directly the existence of protected boundary states, while quantum walks with a non-trivial quasienergy winding have a discrete number of perfectly transmistting unidirectional modes. Our classification provides a unified framework that includes all known types of topology in one dimensional discrete-time quantum walks and is very well suited for the analysis of finite size and disorder effects. We provide a simple scheme to directly measure the topological invariants in an optical quantum walk experiment.

abstract: We investigate "the Wojcik model" introduced and studied by Wojcik et al., which is a one-defect quantum walk (QW) having a single phase at the origin. They reported that giving a phase at one point causes an astonishing effect for localization. There are three types of measures having important roles in the study of QWs: time-averaged limit measure, weak limit measure, and stationary measure. The first two measures imply a coexistence of localized behavior and the ballistic spreading in the QW. As Konno et al. suggested, the time-averaged limit and stationary measures are closely related to each other for some models. In this paper, we focus on a relation between the two measures for the Wojcik model. The stationary measure was already obtained by our previous work. Here, we get the time-averaged limit measure by several methods. Our results show that the stationary measure is a special case of the time-averaged limit measure.

abstract: We introduce and study a new model of interactive proofs: AM(k), or Arthur-Merlin with k non-communicating Merlins. Unlike with the better-known MIP, here the assumption is that each Merlin receives an independent random challenge from Arthur. One motivation for this model (which we explore in detail) comes from the close analogies between it and the quantum complexity class QMA(k), but the AM(k) model is also natural in its own right. We illustrate the power of multiple Merlins by giving an AM(2) protocol for 3SAT, in which the Merlins' challenges and responses consist of only n^{1/2+o(1)} bits each. Our protocol has the consequence that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), any algorithm for approximating a dense CSP with a polynomial-size alphabet must take n^{(log n)^{1-o(1)}} time. Algorithms nearly matching this lower bound are known, but their running times had never been previously explained. Brandao and Harrow have also recently used our 3SAT protocol to show quasipolynomial hardness for approximating the values of certain entangled games. In the other direction, we give a simple quasipolynomial-time approximation algorithm for free games, and use it to prove that, assuming the ETH, our 3SAT protocol is essentially optimal. More generally, we show that multiple Merlins never provide more than a polynomial advantage over one: that is, AM(k)=AM for all k=poly(n). The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games, which follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. on subsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can be closely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame.
