**1.    Zitterbewegung, Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Tunneling in a Quantum Walk**  
Alois Regensburger, Christoph Bersch, Benjamin Hinrichs, Georgy Onishchukov, Andreas Schreiber, Christine Silberhorn, Ulf Peschel  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0105  
<blockquote>
<p>
We experimentally investigate a discrete time quantum walk in a system of coupled fiber loops and observe typical phenomena known from the wave propagation in periodic structures as ballistic spreading or an oscillation between two internal quantum states similar to Zitterbewegung (trembling motion). If a position-dependent phase gradient is applied we find localization and Bloch oscillations of the field for moderate as well as Landau-Zener tunneling for strong phase gradients.

**2.    Symmetry and Quantum Transport on Networks**  
S. Salimi, R. Radgohar, M. M. Soltanzadeh  
International Journal of Quantum Information Vol. 8, No. 8 (2010) 1323-1335  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0596  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the classical and quantum transport processes on some finite networks and model them by continuous-time random walks (CTRW) and continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW), respectively. We calculate the classical and quantum transition probabilities between two nodes of the network. We numerically show that there is a high probability to find the walker at the initial node for CTQWs on the underlying networks due to the interference phenomenon, even for long times. To get global information (independent of the starting node) about the transport efficiency, we average the return probability over all nodes of the network. We apply the decay rate and the asymptotic value of the average of the return probability to evaluate the transport efficiency. Our numerical results prove that the existence of the symmetry in the underlying networks makes quantum transport less efficient than the classical one. In addition, we find that the increasing of the symmetry of these networks decreases the efficiency of quantum transport on them.

<blockquote>
<p>
We study a class of discrete-time quantum walks with inhomogeneous coins defined in [Y. Shikano and H. Katsura, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 82}, 031122 (2010)]. We establish symmetry properties of the spectrum of the evolution operator, which resembles the Hofstadter butterfly.

**4.    Brun-Type Formalism for Decoherence in Two Dimensional Quantum Walks**  
Clement Ampadu  
Communications in Theoretical Physics (2012),Volume 57, Number 1, pp 41-55  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2061  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study decoherence in the quantum walk on the xy-plane. We generalize the method of decoherent coin quantum walk, introduced by [T.A. Brun, et.al, Phys.Rev.A 67 (2003) 032304],which could be applicable to all sorts of decoherence in two dimensional quantum walks, irrespective of the unitary transformation governing the walk. As an application we study decoherence in the presence of broken line noise in which the quantum walk is governed by the two-dimensional Hadamard operator.

**5.    Asymptotic evolution of quantum walks on the $N$-cycle subject to decoherence on both the coin and position degrees of freedom**  
Chaobin Liu, Nelson Petulante  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 012317 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2653  
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider a discrete-time quantum walk on the $N$-cycle subject to decoherence both on the coin and the position degrees of freedom. By examining the evolution of the density matrix of the system, we derive some new conclusions about the asymptotic behavior of the system. When $N$ is odd, the density matrix of the system tends, in the long run, to the maximally mixed state, independent of the initial state. When $N$ is even, although the behavior of the system is not necessarily asymptotically stationary, in this case too an explicit formulation is obtained of the asymptotic dynamics of the system. Moreover, this approach enables us to specify the limiting behavior of the mutual information, viewed as a measure of quantum entanglement between subsystems (coin and walker). In particular, our results provide efficient theoretical confirmation of the findings of previous authors, who arrived at their results through extensive numerical simulations. Our results can be attributed to an important theorem which, for a generalized random unitary operation, explicitly identifies the structure of all of its eigenspaces corresponding to eigenvalues of unit modulus.

**6.    Numerical Study on Quantum Walks Implemented on the Cascade Rotational Transitions in a Diatomic Molecule**  
Leo Matsuoka, Tatsuya Kasajima, Masashi Hashimoto, Keiichi Yokoyama  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4157  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose an implementation scheme for the continuous-time quantum walk using a diatomic molecule and an optical frequency comb. We show an analogy between the quantum walk and the cascade rotational transitions induced by the optical frequency comb whose frequency peaks are tuned to the pure rotational transitions in the molecule. The strategy to compensate for the centrifugal distortion of the real molecule is also demonstrated.

**7.    Universal dynamical decoupling of multiqubit states from environment**  
Liang Jiang, Adilet Imambekov  
Phys. Rev. A 84, 060302(R) (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5021  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study the dynamical decoupling of multiqubit states from environment. For a system of m qubits, the nested Uhrig dynamical decoupling (NUDD) sequence can efficiently suppress generic decoherence induced by system-environment interaction to order N using (N+1)^2m pulses. We prove that the NUDD sequence is universal, i.e., it can restore the coherence of m-qubit quantum system independent of the details of system-environment interaction. We also construct a general mapping between dynamical decoupling problems and discrete quantum walks in certain functional spaces.

We consider the discrete-time quantum walk in the plane, and present a quantum implementation of Parrondo's game for four players. Physical significance of the game strategies are also discussed.

**9.    Projective simulation for artificial intelligence**  
Hans J. Briegel, Gemma De las Cuevas  
Sci. Rep. 2, 400 (2012)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.3787  
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a model of a learning agent whose interaction with the environment is governed by a simulation-based projection, which allows the agent to project itself into future situations before it takes real action. Projective simulation is based on a random walk through a network of clips, which are elementary patches of episodic memory. The network of clips changes dynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional principles of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened for specific features which trigger factual action of the agent. The scheme is different from other, computational, notions of simulation, and it provides a new element in an embodied cognitive science approach to intelligent action and learning. Our model provides a natural route for generalization to quantum-mechanical operation and connects the fields of reinforcement learning and quantum computation.
