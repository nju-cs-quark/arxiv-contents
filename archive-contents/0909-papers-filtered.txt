abstract: Quantum random walk in a two-dimensional lattice with randomly distributed traps is investigated. Distributions of quantum walkers are evaluated dynamically for the cases of Hadamard, Fourier, and Grover coins, and quantum to classical transition is examined as a function of the density of the traps. It is shown that traps act as a serious and additional source of quantum decoherence. Furthermore, non-trivial temporal dependence of the standard deviation of the probability distribution of the walker is found when the trapping imperfections are introduced.

abstract: We show that the detection efficiencies required for closing the detection loophole in Bell tests can be significantly lowered using quantum systems of dimension larger than two. We introduce a series of asymmetric Bell tests for which an efficiency arbitrarily close to 1/N can be tolerated using N-dimensional systems, and a symmetric Bell test for which the efficiency can be lowered down to 61.8% using four-dimensional systems. Experimental perspectives for our schemes look promising considering recent progress in atom-photon entanglement and in photon hyperentanglement.

title: Limits on entropic uncertainty relations for 3 and more MUBs

abstract: We consider entropic uncertainty relations for outcomes of the measurements of a quantum state in 3 or more mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), chosen from the standard construction of MUBs in prime dimension. We show that, for any choice of 3 MUBs and at least one choice of a larger number of MUBs, the best possible entropic uncertainty relation can be only marginally better than the one that trivially follows from the relation by Maassen and Uffink (PRL, 1987) for 2 bases.
