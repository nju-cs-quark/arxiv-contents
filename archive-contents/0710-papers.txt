abstract: Twin entangled beams produced by single-pass parametric down-conversion (PDC) offer the opportunity to detect weak amount of absorption with an improved sensitivity with respect to standard techniques which make use of classical light sources. We propose a differential measurement scheme which exploits the spatial quantum correlation of type II PDC to image a weak amplitude object with a sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit imposed by shot-noise.

abstract: In this article, we study optimal control of dynamics in a linear chain of three spin 1/2, weakly coupled with unequal Ising couplings. We address the problem of time-optimal synthesis of multiple spin quantum coherences. We derive time-optimal pulse sequence for creating a desired spin order by computing geodesics on a sphere under a special metric. The solution to the geodesic equation is related to the nonlinear oscillator equation and the minimum time to create multiple spin order can be expressed in terms of an elliptic integral. These techniques are used for efficient creation of multiple spin coherences in Ising spin-chains with unequal couplings.

abstract: A major open problem in communication complexity is whether or not quantum protocols can be exponentially more efficient than classical protocols on _total_ Boolean functions in the two-party interactive model. The answer appears to be ``No''. In 2002, Razborov proved this conjecture for so far the most general class of functions F(x, y) = f(x_1 * y_1, x_2 * y_2, ..., x_n * y_n), where f is a_symmetric_ Boolean function on n Boolean inputs, and x_i, y_i are the i'th bit of x and y, respectively. His elegant proof critically depends on the symmetry of f. We develop a lower-bound method that does not require symmetry and prove the conjecture for a broader class of functions. Each of those functions F(x, y) is obtained by what we call the ``block-composition'' of a ``building block'' g : {0, 1}^k by {0, 1}^k --> {0, 1}, with an f : {0, 1}^n -->{0, 1}, such that F(x, y) = f(g(x_1, y_1), g(x_2, y_2), ..., g(x_n, y_n)), where x_i and y_i are the i'th k-bit block of x and y, respectively. We show that as long as g itself is ``hard'' enough, its block-composition with an_arbitrary_ f has polynomially related quantum and classical communication complexities. Our approach gives an alternative proof for Razborov's result (albeit with a slightly weaker parameter), and establishes new quantum lower bounds. For example, when g is the Inner Product function for k=\Omega(\log n), the_deterministic_ communication complexity of its block-composition with_any_ f is asymptotically at most the quantum complexity to the power of 7.

abstract: We investigate the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in two-color photoassociation for a atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate. By applying two time-varying Guassian laser pulses that fulfill generalized two-photon resonance condition, we obtain highly efficient atom-molecule conversion. The efficiency depends on the free-bound detuning and the delay time between the two pulses. By adjusting the parameters optimally, we achieve 92% conversion efficiency.

abstract: For two-path interferometers, the which-path predictability $\mathcal{P}$ and the fringe visibility $\mathcal{V}$ are familiar quantities that are much used to talk about wave-particle duality in a quantitative way. We discuss several candidates that suggest themselves as generalizations $P$ of $ mathcal{P}$ for multi-path interferometers, and treat the case of three paths in considerable detail. To each choice for the \emph{path knowledge} $P$, the \emph{interference strength} $V$ -- the corresponding generalization of $\mathcal{V}$ -- is found by a natural, operational procedure. In experimental terms it amounts to finding those equal-weight superpositions of the path amplitudes which maximize $P$ for the emerging intensities. Mathematically speaking, one needs to identify a certain optimal one among the Fourier transforms of the state of the interfering quantum object. Wave-particle duality is manifest, inasmuch as P=1 implies V=0 and V=1 implies P=0, whatever definition is chosen. The possible values of the pair $(P,V)$ are restricted to an area with corners at $(P,V)=(0,0)$, $(P,V)=(1,0)$, and $(P,V)=(0,1)$, with the shape of the border line from $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$ depending on the particular choice for $P$ and the induced definition of $V$.

abstract: The progress in quantum operations of continuous-variable (CV) schemes can be reduced to that in CV quantum teleportation. The fidelity of quantum teleportation of an optical setup is limited by the finite degree of quantum correlation which can be prepared with a pair of finitely squeezed states. Reports of improvement of squeezing level have appeared recently, and we adopted the improved methods in our experimental system of quantum teleportation. As a result, we teleported a coherent state with a fidelity $F=0.83\pm 0.01$, which is better than any other figures reported to date. In this paper, we introduce a measure $n_{s}$, the number of teleportations expected to be carried out sequentially. Our result corresponds to $n_{s}$=5.0$\pm$0.4. It suggests that our improvement would enable us to proceed toward more advanced quantum operations involving multi-step quantum operations.

abstract: Anyons are exotic quasiparticles living in two dimensions that do not fit into the usual categories of fermions and bosons, but obey a new form of fractional statistics. Following a recent proposal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 150404 (2007)], we present an experimental demonstration of the fractional statistics of anyons in the Kitaev spin lattice model using a photonic quantum simulator. We dynamically create the ground state and excited states (which are six-qubit graph states) of the Kitaev model Hamiltonian, and implement the anyonic braiding and fusion operations by single-qubit rotations. A phase shift of $\pi$ related to the anyon braiding is observed, confirming the prediction of the fractional statistics of Abelian 1/2-anyons.

abstract: We study the performance of initial product states of n-body systems in generalized quantum metrology protocols that involve estimating an unknown coupling constant in a nonlinear k-body (k << n) Hamiltonian. We obtain the theoretical lower bound on the uncertainty in the estimate of the parameter. For arbitrary initial states, the lower bound scales as 1/n^k, and for initial product states, it scales as 1/n^(k-1/2). We show that the latter scaling can be achieved using simple, separable measurements. We analyze in detail the case of a quadratic Hamiltonian (k = 2), implementable with Bose-Einstein condensates. We formulate a simple model, based on the evolution of angular-momentum coherent states, which explains the O(n^(-3/2)) scaling for k = 2; the model shows that the entanglement generated by the quadratic Hamiltonian does not play a role in the enhanced sensitivity scaling. We show that phase decoherence does not affect the O(n^(-3/2)) sensitivity scaling for initial product states.

In addition, we present an experimental implementation of the protocol using four-photon entanglement.

abstract: We first consider stimulated Raman adibatic passages (STIRAP) in a closed four-level tripod system. In this case, the adiabatic eigenstates of the system acquire real geometric phases. When the system is open and subject to decoherence they acquire complex geometric phases that we determine by a Monte Carlo wave function approach. We calculate the geometric phases and the state evolution in the closed as well as in the open system cases and describe the deviation between these in terms of the phases acquired. When the system is closed, the adiabatic evolution implements a Hadamard gate. The open system implements an imperfect gate and hence has a fidelity below unity. We express this fidelity in terms of the acquired geometric phases.

abstract: This work is an application of game theory to quantum information. In a state estimate, we are given observations distributed according to an unknown distribution $P_{\theta}$ (associated with award $Q$), which Nature chooses at random from the set $\{P_{\theta}: \theta \in \Theta \}$ according to a known prior distribution $\mu$ on $\Theta$, we produce an estimate $M$ for the unknown distribution $P_{\theta}$, and in the end, we will suffer a relative entropy cost $\mathcal{R}(P;M)$, measuring the quality of this estimate, therefore the whole utility is taken as $P \cdot Q -\mathcal{R}(P; M)$. In an introduction to strategic game, a sufficient condition for minimax theorem is obtained; An estimate is explored in the frame of game theory, and in the view of convex conjugate, we reach one new approach to quantum relative entropy, correspondingly quantum mutual entropy, and quantum channel capacity, which are more general, in the sense, without Radon-Nikodym (RN) derivatives. Also the monotonicity of quantum relative entropy and the additivity of quantum channel capacity are investigated.

The source is incorporated into a phase encoded interferometric scheme implementing the BB84 protocol for key distribution over standard telecommunication optical fiber. We show a transmission distance advantage over that possible with (length-optimized) uniform intensity weak coherent pulses at 1310 nm in the same system.

abstract: A new method is developed to derive an algebraic equations for the geometric measure of entanglement of three qubit pure states. The equations are derived explicitly and solved in cases of most interest. These equations allow oneself to derive the analytic expressions of the geometric entanglement measure in the wide range of the three qubit systems, including the general class of W-states and states which are symmetric under permutation of two qubits. The nearest separable states are not necessarily unique and highly entangled states are surrounded by the one-parametric set of equally distant separable states. A possibility for the physical applications of the various three qubit states to quantum teleportation and superdense coding is suggested from the aspect of the entanglement.

abstract: A quantum control landscape is defined as the physical objective as a function of the control variables. In this paper the control landscapes for two-level open quantum systems, whose evolution is described by general completely positive trace preserving maps (i.e., Kraus maps), are investigated in details. The objective function, which is the expectation value of a target system operator, is defined on the Stiefel manifold representing the space of Kraus maps. Three practically important properties of the objective function are found: (a) the absence of local maxima or minima (i.e., false traps); (b) the existence of multi-dimensional sub-manifolds of optimal solutions corresponding to the global maximum and minimum; and (c) the connectivity of each level set. All of the critical values and their associated critical sub-manifolds are explicitly found for any initial system state. Away from the absolute extrema there are no local maxima or minima, and only saddles may exist, whose number and the explicit structure of the corresponding critical sub-manifolds are determined by the initial system state. There are no saddles for pure initial states, one saddle for a completely mixed initial state, and two saddles for other initial states. In general, the landscape analysis of critical points and optimal manifolds is relevant to the problem of explaining the relative ease of obtaining good optimal control outcomes in the laboratory, even in the presence of the environment.

abstract: We have numerically solved the Heisenberg-Langevin equations describing the propagation of quantized fields through an optically thick sample of atoms. Two orthogonal polarization components are considered for the field and the complete Zeeman sublevel structure of the atomic transition is taken into account. Quantum fluctuations of atomic operators are included through appropriate Langevin forces. We have considered an incident field in a linearly polarized coherent state (driving field) and vacuum in the perpendicular polarization and calculated the noise spectra of the amplitude and phase quadratures of the output field for two orthogonal polarizations. We analyze different configurations depending on the total angular momentum of the ground and excited atomic states. We examine the generation of squeezing for the driving field polarization component and vacuum squeezing of the orthogonal polarization. Entanglement of orthogonally polarized modes is predicted. Noise spectral features specific of (Zeeman) multi-level configurations are identified.

The result is a quantum expander which acts on discrete Wigner functions in the same way the classical Margulis expander acts on probability distributions. The quantum version shares all essential properties of the classical counterpart, e.g., it has the same degree and spectrum. Unlike previous constructions of quantum expanders, our method does not rely on non-Abelian harmonic analysis. Analogues for continuous variable systems are mentioned. Indeed, the construction seems one of the few instances where applications based on discrete and continuous phase space methods can be developed in complete analogy.

journal:

abstract: We consider one-round games between a classical verifier and two provers who share entanglement. We show that when the constraints enforced by the verifier are `unique' constraints (i.e., permutations), the value of the game can be well approximated by a semidefinite program. Essentially the only algorithm known previously was for the special case of binary answers, as follows from the work of Tsirelson in 1980. Among other things, our result implies that the variant of the unique games conjecture where we allow the provers to share entanglement is false. Our proof is based on a novel `quantum rounding technique', showing how to take a solution to an SDP and transform it to a strategy for entangled provers. Using our approximation by a semidefinite program we also show a parallel repetition theorem for unique entangled games.

abstract: Numerous lines of experimental, numerical and analytical evidence indicate that it is surprisingly easy to locate optimal controls steering quantum dynamical systems to desired objectives. This has enabled the control of complex quantum systems despite the expense of solving the Schrodinger equation in simulations and the complicating effects of environmental decoherence in the laboratory. Recent work indicates that this simplicity originates in universal properties of the solution sets to quantum control problems that are fundamentally different from their classical counterparts. Here, we review studies that aim to systematically characterize these properties, enabling the classification of quantum control mechanisms and the design of globally efficient quantum control algorithms.

We examine the mirror-field entanglement as a function of ambient temperature, radiation detuning and orbital angular momentum carried by the cavity mode.

They also unveil a connection between the performance of ER and the logarithmic violations of the boundary law for entanglement in systems with a one-dimensional Fermi surface. ER is recast in the language of creation/annihilation operators and correlation matrices.

abstract: We derive an uncertainty relation for two unitary operators which obey a commutation relation of the form UV=exp[i phi] VU. Its most important application is to constrain how much a quantum state can be localised simultaneously in two mutually unbiased bases related by a Discrete Fourier Transform. It provides an uncertainty relation which smoothly interpolates between the well known cases of the Pauli operators in 2 dimensions and the continuous variables position and momentum. This work also provides an uncertainty relation for modular variables, and could find applications in signal processing. In the finite dimensional case the minimum uncertainty states, discrete analogues of coherent and squeezed states, are minimum energy solutions of Harper's equation, a discrete version of the Harmonic oscillator equation.

abstract: We present an analysis of atomic diffraction due to the interaction of an atomic beam with a pair of Gaussian light pulses. We derive a simple analytical expression for the populations in different diffraction orders. The validity of the obtained solution extends beyond the Raman-Nath regime, where the kinetic energy associated with different diffraction peaks is neglected, into the so-called channeling regime where accurate analytical expressions have not previously been available for the diffraction. Comparison with experimental results and exact numerical solutions demonstrate the validity of our analytical formula.

abstract: A scheme is proposed which allows to obtain special $q$-oscillator models whose characteristic feature consists in possessing two differing pairs of degenerate energy levels. The method uses the model of two-parameter deformed $q,p$-oscillators and proceeds via appropriately chosen particular relation between $p$ and $q$. Different versions of quadratic relations $p=f(q)$ are utilized for the case which implies two degenerate pairs $E_1=E_2$ and $E_3=E_4$. On the other hand, using one fixed quadratic relation, we obtain $p$-oscillators with other cases of two pairs of (pairwise) degenerate energy levels.

abstract: The Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory of spontaneous wave function collapse is known to provide a quantum theory without observers, in fact two different ones by using either the matter density ontology (GRWm) or the flash ontology (GRWf). Both theories are known to make predictions different from those of quantum mechanics, but the difference is so small that no decisive experiment can as yet be performed. While some testable deviations from quantum mechanics have long been known, we provide here something that has until now been missing: a formalism that succinctly summarizes the empirical predictions of GRWm and GRWf. We call it the GRW formalism. Its structure is similar to that of the quantum formalism but involves different operators. In other words, we establish the validity of a general algorithm for directly computing the testable predictions of GRWm and GRWf. We further show that some well-defined quantities cannot be measured in a GRWm or GRWf world.

While their isolated observation has not yet been achieved, here we perform a quantum simulation of anyons on the toric code model. By encoding the model in the multi-partite entangled state of polarized photons, we are able to demonstrate various manipulations of anyonic states and, in particular, their characteristic fractional statistics.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Entanglement is sometimes helpful in distinguishing between quantum operations, as differences between quantum operations can become magnified when their inputs are entangled with auxiliary systems. Bounds on the dimension of the auxiliary system needed to optimally distinguish quantum operations are known in several situations. For instance, the dimension of the auxiliary space never needs to exceed the dimension of the input space of the operations for optimal distinguishability, while no auxiliary system whatsoever is needed to optimally distinguish unitary operations. Another bound, which follows from work of R. Timoney, is that optimal distinguishability is always possible when the dimension of the auxiliary system is twice the number of operators needed to express the difference between the quantum operations in Kraus form. This paper provides an alternate proof of this fact that is based on concepts and tools that are familiar to quantum information theorists.

abstract: A new optical pumping scheme is presented that uses incoherent Raman transitions to prepare a trapped Cesium atom in a specific Zeeman state within the 6S_{1/2}, F=3 hyperfine manifold. An important advantage of this scheme over existing optical pumping schemes is that the atom can be prepared in any of the F=3 Zeeman states. We demonstrate the scheme in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics, but the technique is equally applicable to a wide variety of atomic systems with hyperfine ground-state structure.

abstract: As a continuation of our previous work (arXiv:0708.4333) an algebraic geometrical study of a single $d$-dimensional qudit is made, with $d$ being {\it any} positive integer. The study is based on an intricate relation between the symplectic module of the generalized Pauli group of the qudit and the fine structure of the projective line over the (modular) ring $\bZ_{d}$. Explicit formulae are given for both the number of generalized Pauli operators commuting with a given one and the number of points of the projective line containing the corresponding vector of $\bZ^{2}_{d}$. We find, remarkably, that a perp-set is not a set-theoretic union of the corresponding points of the associated projective line unless $d$ is a product of distinct primes. The operators are also seen to be structured into disjoint `layers' according to the degree of their representing vectors. A brief comparison with some multiple-qudit cases is made.

abstract: A new thermodynamic inequality is derived which leads to the maximum work that can be extracted from multi-heat baths with the assistance of discrete quantum feedback control. The maximum work is determined by the free-energy difference and a generalized mutual information content between the thermodynamic system and the feedback controller. This maximum work can exceed that in conventional thermodynamics and, in the case of a heat cycle with two heat baths, the heat efficiency can be greater than that of the Carnot cycle. The consistency of our results with the second law of thermodynamics is ensured by the fact that work is needed for information processing of the feedback controller.

abstract: We describe a protocol capable of preparing an arbitrary state of two photons in several spatial modes using pairs of photons generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion, linear optical elements and single-photon detectors or post-selection. The protocol involves unitary and non-unitary transformations realizable by beam splitters and phase shifters. Non-unitary transformations are implemented by attenuation filters. The protocol contains several optimization capabilities with the goal of improving overall probability of its success. We also show how entangled two-photon states required for quantum computing with linear optics can be prepared using a very simple and feasible scheme.

abstract: We restate Kay's 1998 hypothesis which simultaneously offers an objective definition for the entropy of a closed system, a microscopic foundation for the Second Law, a resolution of the Information Loss (and other) Black-Hole Puzzle(s) and an objective mechanism for decoherence. Presupposing a conventional unitary theory of low-energy quantum gravity, it offers all this by taking the physical density operator of a closed system to be the partial trace of its total density operator (assumed pure) over gravity and by defining its physical entropy to be its `matter-gravity entanglement entropy'. We also recall Kay's 1998 modified non-relativistic (many-body) quantum mechanics based on Kay's hypothesis with a Newtonian approximation to quantum gravity. In this modification, we find formal expectation values for certain `observables' such as momentum-squared and Parity are altered but those for functions of positions are unaltered. However, by arguing that every real measurement can ultimately be taken to be a position measurement, we prove that, in practice, it is impossible to detect any alteration at all and, in particular, we predict no alteration for Roger Penrose's experiment. Nevertheless, Kay's modification contains no Schr\"odinger Cat-like states, and also allows an `events' interpretation which we tentatively propose and begin to explore. We also obtain a Second-Law type result for a non-relativistic toy-model closed system and argue that similar results will apply for a wide class of model Newtonian and post-Newtonian closed systems although we argue that ordinary actual lab-sized systems can never be treated as closed for the purpose of calculating their entropy. Compared with `collapse models' such as GRW, Kay's Newtonian theory does a similar job while being free from ad hoc assumptions.

abstract: By regarding the Lifshitz expression for the Casimir free energy on the real frequency axis rather than the imaginary Matsubara frequencies as is customary, new light is shed on the ongoing debate regarding the thermodynamical consistency of this theory in combination with common permittivity models. It is argued that when permittivity is temperature independent over a temperature interval including zero temperature, a cavity made of causal material with continuous dispersion properties separated by vacuum cannot violate Nernst's theorem (the third law of thermodynamics). The purported violation of this theorem pertains to divergencies in the double limit in which frequency and temperature vanish simultaneously. While any model should abide by the laws of thermodynamics within its range of applicability, we emphasise that the Nernst heat theorem is a relevant criterion for choosing amongst candidate theories only when these theories are fully applicable at zero temperature and frequency.

This analysis allows a generalization of the [4,1] `approximate' amplitude damping code of quant-ph/9704002. We present this generalization as a class of [2(M+1),M] codes and present quantum circuits for encoding and recovery operations. We also present a [7,3] amplitude damping code based on the classical Hamming code. All of these are stabilizer codes whose encoding and recovery operations can be completely described with Clifford group operations. Finally, we describe optimization options in which recovery operations may be further adapted according to the damping probability gamma.

abstract: We study various distance-like entanglement measures of multipartite states under certain symmetries. Using group averaging techniques we provide conditions under which the relative entropy of entanglement, the geometric measure of entanglement and the logarithmic robustness are equivalent. We consider important classes of multiparty states, and in particular show that these measures are equivalent for all stabilizer states, symmetric basis and antisymmetric basis states. We rigorously prove a conjecture that the closest product state of permutation symmetric states can always be chosen to be permutation symmetric. This allows us to calculate the explicit values of various entanglement measures for symmetric and antisymmetric basis states, observing that antisymmetric states are generally more entangled. We use these results to obtain a variety of interesting ensembles of quantum states for which the optimal LOCC discrimination probability may be explicitly determined and achieved. We also discuss applications to the construction of optimal entanglement witnesses.

abstract: A scheme for fine tuning of quantum operations to improve their performance is proposed. A quantum system in $\Lambda$ configuration with two-photon Raman transitions is considered without adiabatic elimination of the excited (intermediate) state. Conditional dynamics of the system is studied with focus on improving fidelity of quantum operations. In particular, the $\pi$ pulse and $\pi/2$ pulse quantum operations are considered. The dressed states for the atom-field system, with an atom driven on one transition by a classical field and on the other by a quantum cavity field, are found. A discrete set of detunings is given for which high fidelity of desired states is achieved. Analytical solutions for the quantum state amplitudes are found in the first order perturbation theory with respect to the cavity damping rate $\kappa$ and the spontaneous emission rate $\gamma$. Numerical solutions for higher values of $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ indicate a stabilizing role of spontaneous emission in the $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ pulse quantum operations. The idea can also be applied for excitation pulses of different shapes.

abstract: S. Longhi [1] studied the survival probability P(t) of an unstable state coupled to a tight-binding lattice finding an exact analytical solution that describes the nonexponential decay. When the first coupling is smaller than the others, he shows that P(t) has a natural decomposition into two terms; one is the exponential decay, consistent with the Gamow's approach, and the other is the correction to this decay. The first purpose of this Comment is to show that the condition imposed on the system; the site energy of the first site is set in the center of the band, limits the generality of the results. A decomposition based on the spectral properties of the system removes this restriction [2]. Other point of this Comment is that, for the weak coupling limit, the author stated that a Zeno effect occurs for t less than t*, where t* is the smallest root of the equation g_eff(t*)=g_0, and for the strong coupling limit an anti-Zeno effect occurs for t close to t**, where t** is the first peak of g_eff. By using a spectral formulation we show that, the anti-Zeno effect not only requires a strong coupling limit, also is necessary to choose the resonance energy and width such that a destructive interference can occur. We present this interference and give an analytical expression and physically interpretation for t* and t**.

abstract: We discuss a possibility of implementing a universal quantum XOR gate, by using two coupled quantum dots subjected to external magnetic fields that are parallel and slightly different. We consider this system in two different field configurations. In the first case, parallel external fields with the intensity difference at each spin being proportional to the time-dependent interaction between the spins. General exact solution describing this system is presented and analyzed to adjust parameters of the field. Then we consider parallel fields with intensity difference at each spin being constant and the interaction between the spins switching on and off adiabatically. In both cases we adjust characteristics of the external fields (their intensities and duration) in order to have the parallel pulse adequate for constructing the XOR gate. In order to provide a complete theoretical description of all the cases, we derive relations between the spin interaction, the inter-dot distance, and the external field.

For only 7 mW of pump power it has a created spectral radiance of 0.08 pairs per coherence length and a bandwidth of 10 pm (1.2 GHz). The effectively emitted spectral brightness reaches 3.9*10^5 pairs /(s pm). Furthermore, when combined with low jitter single photon detectors, such sources allow for the implementation of quantum communication protocols without any active synchronization or path length stabilization. A HOM-Dip with photons from two autonomous CW sources has been realized demonstrating the setup's stability and performance.

abstract: We analyze a class of non-Hermitian quadratic Hamiltonians, which are of the form $ H = {\cal{A}}^{\dagger} {\cal{A}} + \alpha {\cal{A}} ^2 + \beta {\cal{A}}^{\dagger 2} $, where $ \alpha, \beta $ are real constants, with $ \alpha \neq \beta $, and ${\cal{A}}^{\dagger}$ and ${\cal{A}}$ are generalized creation and annihilation operators. Thus these Hamiltonians may be classified as generalized Swanson models. It is shown that the eigenenergies are real for a certain range of values of the parameters. A similarity transformation $\rho$, mapping the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian $H$ to a Hermitian one $h$, is also obtained. It is shown that $H$ and $h$ share identical energies. As explicit examples, the solutions of a couple of models based on the trigonometric Rosen-Morse I and the hyperbolic Rosen-Morse II type potentials are obtained. We also study the case when the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is ${\cal{PT}}$ symmetric.

abstract: Uncertainty relations lie at the very core of quantum mechanics, and form the cornerstone of essentially all quantum cryptographic applications. In particular, they play an important role in cryptographic protocols in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where proving the security of all existing protocols ultimately reduces to bounding such relations. Yet, very little is known about such uncertainty relations for more than two measurements. Here, we prove optimal entropic uncertainty relations for anti-commuting binary observables for the Shannon entropy, and nearly optimal relations for the collision entropy. Our results have immediate applications to quantum cryptography.

abstract: We demonstrate a formally exact quantum-classical correspondence between the stationary coherent states associated with the commensurate anisotropic two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the classical Lissajous orbits. Our derivation draws upon earlier work of Louck et al [1973 \textit {J. Math. Phys.} \textbf {14} 692] wherein they have provided a non-bijective canonical transformation that maps, within a degenerate eigenspace, the commensurate anisotropic oscillator on to the isotropic oscillator. This mapping leads, in a natural manner, to a Schwinger realization of SU(2) in terms of the canonically transformed creation and annihilation operators. Through the corresponding coherent states built over a degenerate eigenspace, we directly effect the classical limit via the expectation values of the underlying generators. Our work completely accounts for the fact that the SU(2) coherent state in general corresponds to an ensemble of Lissajous orbits.

abstract: Intervention theories of causality define a relationship as causal if appropriately specified interventions to manipulate a putative cause tend to produce changes in the putative effect. Interventionist causal theories are commonly formalized by using directed graphs to represent causal relationships, local probability models to quantify the relationship between cause and effect, and a special kind of conditioning operator to represent the effects of interventions. Such a formal model represents a family of joint probability distributions, one for each allowable intervention policy. This paper interprets the von Neumann formalization of quantum theory as an interventionist theory of causality, describes its relationship to interventionist theories popular in the artificial intelligence literature, and presents a new family of graphical models that extends causal Bayesian networks to quantum systems.

abstract: In ion traps, entangling gate operations can be realized by a bichromatic pair of laser beams that collectively interact with the ions. In this paper, a new method of modelling the laser-ion interaction is introduced that turns out to be superior to standard techniques for the description of gate operations on optical qubits. The treatment allows for a comparison of the performance of gates based on $\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z$ and M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen interactions on optical transitions where the bichromatic laser field can be realized by an amplitude-modulated laser resonant with the qubit transition. Shaping the amplitude of the bichromatic laser pulse is shown to make the gates more robust against experimental imperfections.

abstract: We report on the all-optical detection of Rydberg states in a effusive atomic beam of strontium atoms using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Using narrow-linewidth CW lasers we obtain an EIT linewidth of 5 MHz. To illustrate the high spectroscopic resolution offered by this method, we have measured isotope shifts of the 5s18d ^1D_2 and 5s19s ^1S_0 Rydberg states. This technique could be applied to high-resolution, non-destructive measurements of ultra-cold Rydberg gases and plasmas.

abstract: We formulate a scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation that works effectively against highly biased noise, where dephasing is far stronger than all other types of noise. In our scheme, the fundamental operations performed by the quantum computer are single-qubit preparations, single-qubit measurements, and conditional-phase (CPHASE) gates, where the noise in the CPHASE gates is biased. We show that the accuracy threshold for quantum computation can be improved by exploiting this noise asymmetry; e.g., if dephasing dominates all other types of noise in the CPHASE gates by four orders of magnitude, we find a rigorous lower bound on the accuracy threshold higher by a factor of five than for the case of unbiased noise.

abstract: We study the rectification process of interacting quantum particles in a periodic potential exposed to the action of an external ac driving. The breaking of spatio-temporal symmetries leads to directed motion already in the absence of interactions. A hallmark of quantum ratcheting is the appearance of resonant enhancement of the current (Europhys. Lett. 79 (2007) 10007 and Phys. Rev. A 75 (2007) 063424). Here we study the fate of these resonances within a Gross-Pitaevskii equation which describes a mean field interaction between many particles. We find, that the resonance is i) not destroyed by interactions, ii) shifting its location with increasing interaction strength. We trace the Floquet states of the linear equations into the nonlinear domain, and show that the resonance gives rise to an instability and thus to the appearance of new nonlinear Floquet states, whose transport properties differ strongly as compared to the case of noninteracting particles.

abstract: We study the resonance fluorescence from a coherently driven four-level atom in the Y-type configuration. The effects of quantum interference induced by spontaneous emission on the fluorescence properties of the atom are investigated. It is found that the quantum interference resulting from cascade emission decays of the atom leads to a splitting of resonances in the excited level populations calculated as a function of light detuning. For some parameters, interference assisted enhancement of inner sidebands and narrowing of central peaks may also occur in the fluorescence spectrum. We present a physical understandingof our numerical results using the dressed state description of the atom-light interaction.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a simple model for quantum decay, where a single state is coupled to a set of discrete states, the pseudo continuum, each coupled to a real continuum of states. We find that for constant matrix elements between the single state and the pseudo continuum the decay occurs via one state in a certain region of the parameters, involving the Dicke and quantum Zeno effects. When the matrix elements are random several cases are identified. For a pseudo continuum with small bandwidth there are weakly damped oscillations in the probability to be in the initial single state. For intermediate bandwidth one finds mesoscopic fluctuations in the probability with amplitude inversely proportional to the square root of the volume of the pseudo continuum space. They last for a long time compared to the non-random case.

abstract: We present a remarkable finding that a recently discovered [G. S. Uhrig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 100504 (2007)] series of pulse sequences, designed to optimally restore coherence to a qubit in the spin-boson model of decoherence, is in fact completely model-independent and generically valid for arbitrary dephasing Hamiltonians given sufficiently short delay times between pulses. The series maximizes qubit fidelity versus number of applied pulses for sufficiently short delay times because the series, with each additional pulse, cancels successive orders of a time expansion for the fidelity decay. The "magical" universality of this property, which was not appreciated earlier, requires that a linearly growing set of "unknowns" (the delay times) must simultaneously satisfy an exponentially growing set of nonlinear equations that involve arbitrary dephasing Hamiltonian operators.

abstract: Photon interference among distant quantum emitters is a promising method to generate large scale quantum networks. Interference is best achieved when photons show long coherence times. For the nitrogen-vacancy defect center in diamond we measure the coherence times of photons via optically induced Rabi oscillations. Experiments reveal a close to Fourier transform (i.e. lifetime) limited width of photons emitted even when averaged over minutes. The projected contrast of two-photon interference (0.8) is high enough to envisage the applications in quantum information processing. We report 12 and 7.8 ns excited state lifetime depending on the spin state of the defect.

abstract: It is shown how a C*-algebra representation of the transformations of a physical system can be derived from two operational postulates: 1) the existence of dynamically independent systems}; 2) the existence of symmetric faithful states. Both notions are crucial for the possibility of performing experiments on the system, in preventing remote instantaneous influences and in allowing calibration of apparatuses. The case of Quantum Mechanics is thoroughly analyzed. The possibility that other no-signaling theories admit a C*-algebra formulation is discussed.

abstract: We show that in a complex d-dimensional vector space, one can find O(d) bases whose elements form a 2-design. Such vector sets generalize the notion of a maximal collection of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). MUBs have manifold applications in quantum information theory (e.g. in state tomography, cloning, or cryptography) -- however it is suspected that maximal sets exist only in prime-power dimensions. Our construction offers an efficient alternative for general dimensions. The findings are based on a framework recently established in [A. Roy and A. Scott, J. Math. Phys. 48, 072110 (2007)], which reduces the construction of such bases to the combinatorial problem of finding certain highly nonlinear functions between abelian groups.

abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum mechanical evolution of systems described by a Hamiltonian that is a function of a solvable one, both classically and quantum mechanically. The case in which the solvable Hamiltonian corresponds to the harmonic oscillator is emphasized. We show that, in spite of the similarities at the classical level, the quantum evolution is very different. In particular, this difference is important in constructing coherent states, which is impossible in most cases. The class of Hamiltonians we consider is interesting due to its pedagogical value and its applicability to some open research problems in quantum optics and quantum gravity.

abstract: We investigate the set a) of positive, trace preserving maps acting on density matrices of size N, and a sequence of its nested subsets: the sets of maps which are b) decomposable, c) completely positive, d) extended by identity impose positive partial transpose and e) are superpositive. Working with the Hilbert-Schmidt (Euclidean) measure we derive tight explicit two-sided bounds for the volumes of all five sets. A sample consequence is the fact that, as N increases, a generic positive map becomes not decomposable and, a fortiori, not completely positive. Due to the Jamiolkowski isomorphism, the results obtained for quantum maps are closely connected to similar relations between the volume of the set of quantum states and the volumes of its subsets (such as states with positive partial transpose or separable states) or supersets. Our approach depends on systematic use of duality to derive quantitative estimates, and on various tools of classical convexity, high-dimensional probability and geometry of Banach spaces, some of which are not standard.

abstract: In measurement-based quantum computation, quantum algorithms are implemented via sequences of measurements. We describe a translationally invariant finite-range interaction on a one-dimensional qudit chain and prove that a single-shot measurement of the energy of an appropriate computational basis state with respect to this Hamiltonian provides the output of any quantum circuit. The required measurement accuracy scales inverse polynomially with the size of the simulated quantum circuit. This shows that the implementation of energy measurements on generic qudit chains is as hard as the realization of quantum computation. Here a ''measurement'' is any procedure that samples from the spectral measure induced by the observable and the state under consideration. As opposed to measurement-based quantum computation, the post-measurement state is irrelevant.

abstract: We analyze the long time behavior of a quantum computer running a quantum error correction (QEC) code in the presence of a correlated environment. Starting from a Hamiltonian formulation of realistic noise models, and assuming that QEC is indeed possible, we find formal expressions for the probability of a faulty path and the residual decoherence encoded in the reduced density matrix. Systems with non-zero gate times (``long gates'') are included in our analysis by using an upper bound on the noise. In order to introduce the local error probability for a qubit, we assume that propagation of signals through the environment is slower than the QEC period (hypercube assumption). This allows an explicit calculation in the case of a generalized spin-boson model and a quantum frustration model. The key result is a dimensional criterion: If the correlations decay sufficiently fast, the system evolves toward a stochastic error model for which the threshold theorem of fault-tolerant quantum computation has been proven. On the other hand, if the correlations decay slowly, the traditional proof of this threshold theorem does not hold. This dimensional criterion bears many similarities to criteria that occur in the theory of quantum phase transitions.

Here the $N$ idle qubits comprise the finite environment. We obtain very good agreement even for small $N$.

At low temperatures we find deviations between these two entropies which are due to the fact that the Brownian particle and its environment are entangled. We give an explanation for these findings and point out that these deviations become important in cases where statements about the information capacity of the subsystem are associated with thermodynamic properties, as it is the case for the Landauer principle.

abstract: We cannot perform the projective measurement of a momentum on a half line since it is not an observable. Nevertheless, we would like to obtain some physical information of the momentum on a half line. We define an optimality for measurement as minimizing the variance between an inferred outcome of the measured system before a measuring process and a measurement outcome of the probe system after the measuring process, restricting our attention to the covariant measurement studied by Holevo. Extending the domain of the momentum operator on a half line by introducing a two dimensional Hilbert space to be tensored, we make it self-adjoint and explicitly construct a model Hamiltonian for the measured and probe systems. By taking the partial trace over the newly introduced Hilbert space, the optimal covariant positive operator valued measure (POVM) of a momentum on a half line is reproduced. We physically describe the measuring process to optimally evaluate the momentum of a particle on a half line.

We analyze the situation for an inhomogeneous trap within the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field theory, as well as a quantum mechanical Josephson model, which addresses complementary aspects of the problem and agrees well otherwise.

abstract: I provide an alternative way of seeing quantum computation. First, I describe an idealized classical problem solving machine that, thanks to a many body interaction, reversibly and nondeterministically produces the solution of the problem under the simultaneous influence of all the problem constraints. This requires a perfectly accurate, rigid, and reversible relation between the coordinates of the machine parts - the machine can be considered the many body generalization of another perfect machine, the bounching ball model of reversible computation. The mathematical description of the machine, as it is, is applicable to quantum problem solving, an extension of the quantum algorithms that comprises the physical representation of the problem-solution interdependence. The perfect relation between the coordinates of the machine parts is transferred to the populations of the reduced density operators of the parts of the computer register. The solution of the problem is reversibly and nondeterministically produced under the simultaneous influence of the state before measurement and the quantum principle. At the light of the present notion of simultaneous computation, the quantum speed up turns out to be "precognition" of the solution, namely the reduction of the initial ignorance of the solution due to backdating, to before running the algorithm, a time-symmetric part of the state vector reduction on the solution; as such, it is bounded by state vector reduction through an entropic inequality.

abstract: We show that the complex $\cal PT$-symmetric periodic potential $V(x) = - ({\rm i} \xi \sin 2x + N)^2$, where $\xi$ is real and $N$ is a positive integer, is quasi-exactly solvable. For odd values of $N \ge 3$, it may lead to exceptional points depending upon the strength of the coupling parameter $\xi$. The corresponding Schr\"odinger equation is also shown to go over to the Mathieu equation asymptotically. The limiting value of the exceptional points derived in our scheme is consistent with known branch-point singularities of the Mathieu equation.

abstract: A possible two-qubit gate for optical quantum computing is the parity gate based on the weak Kerr effect. Two photonic qubits modulate the phase of a coherent state, and a quadrature measurement of the coherent state reveals the parity of the two qubits without destroying the photons. This can be used to create so-called cluster states, a universal resource for quantum computing. Here, the effect of self-phase modulation on the parity gate is studied, introducing generating functions for the Wigner function of a modulated coherent state. For materials with non-EIT-based Kerr nonlinearities, there is typically a self-phase modulation that is half the magnitude of the cross-phase modulation. Therefore, this effect cannot be ignored. It is shown that for a large class of physical implementations of the phase modulation, the quadrature measurement cannot distinguish between odd and even parity. Consequently, weak nonlinear parity gates must be implemented with physical systems where the self-phase modulation is negligable.

abstract: The task of finding a correctable encoding that protects against some physical quantum process is in general hard. Two main obstacles are that an exponential number of experiments are needed to gain complete information about the quantum process, and known algorithmic methods for finding correctable encodings involve operations on exponentially large matrices. However, we show that in some cases it is possible to find such encodings with only partial information about the quantum process. Such useful partial information can be systematically extracted by averaging the channel under the action of a set of unitaries in a process known as "twirling". In this paper we prove that correctable encodings for a twirled channel are also correctable for the original channel. We investigate the particular case of twirling over the set of Pauli operators and qubit permutations, and show that the resulting quantum operation can be characterized experimentally in a scalable manner. We also provide a postprocessing scheme for finding unitarily correctable codes for these twirled channels which does not involve exponentially large matrices.

abstract: We describe an entanglement witness for $N$-qubit mixed states based on the properties of $N$-point correlation functions. Depending on the degree of violation, this witness can guarantee that no more than $M$ qubits are separable from the rest of the state for any $M\leq N$, or that there is some genuine $M$-party or greater multipartite entanglement present. We illustrate the use our criterion by investigating the existence of entanglement in thermal stabilizer states, where we demonstrate that the witness is capable of witnessing bound-entangled states. Intriguingly, this entanglement can be shown to persist in the thermodynamic limit at arbitrary temperature.

abstract: We construct a large class of bipartite M x N quantum states which defines a proper subset of states with positive partial transposes (PPT). Any state from this class is PPT but the positivity of its partial transposition is recognized with respect to canonical factorization of the original density operator. We propose to call elements from this class states with strong positive partial transposes (SPPT). We conjecture that all SPPT states are separable.

abstract: Recently, it has shown that an explicit local realistic model for the values of a correlation function, given in a two-setting Bell experiment (two-setting model), works only for the specific set of settings in the given experiment, but cannot construct a local realistic model for the values of a correlation function, given in a {\it continuous-infinite} settings Bell experiment (infinite-setting model), even though there exist two-setting models for all directions in space. Hence, two-setting model does not have the property which infinite-setting model has. Here, we show that an explicit two-setting model cannot construct a local realistic model for the values of a correlation function, given in a {\it only discrete-three} settings Bell experiment (three-setting model), even though there exist two-setting models for the three measurement directions chosen in the given three-setting experiment. Hence, two-setting model does not have the property which three-setting model has.

abstract: We study some basic quantum confinement effects through investigation a deformed harmonic oscillator algebra. We show that spatial confinement effects on a quantum harmonic oscillator can be represented by a deformation function within the framework of nonlinear coherent states theory. Using the deformed algebra, we construct a quantum field theory in confined space. In particular, we find that the confinement influences on some physical properties of the electromagnetic field and it gives rise to nonlinear interaction. Furthermore, we propose a physical scheme to generate the nonlinear coherent states associated with the electromagnetic field in a confined region.

abstract: We explore the quantum-classical crossover in the behaviour of a quantum field mode. The quantum behaviour of a two-state system - a qubit - coupled to the field is used as a probe. Collapse and revival of the qubit inversion form the signature for quantum behaviour of the field and continuous Rabi oscillations form the signature for classical behaviour of the field. We demonstrate both limits in a single model for the full coupled system, for states with the same average field strength, and so for qubits with the same Rabi frequency.

abstract: The time evolution of a spin-1/2 particle under the influence of a locally applied external magnetic field, and interacting with anisotropic spin environment in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ is studied. The exact analytical form of the reduced density matrix of the central spin is calculated explicitly for finite number of bath spins. The case of an infinite number of environmental spins is investigated using the convergence of the rescaled bath operators to normal Gaussian random variables. In this limit, we derive the analytical form of the components of the Bloch vector for antiferromagnetic interactions within the bath, and we investigate the short-time and long-time behavior of reduced dynamics. The effect of the external magnetic field, the anisotropy and the temperature of the bath on the decoherence of the central spin is discussed.

abstract: We addressed the question of optimality of private quantum channels. We have shown that the Shannon entropy of the classical key necessary to securely transfer the quantum information is lower bounded by the entropy exchange of the private quantum channel $\cal E$ and von Neumann entropy of the ciphertext state $\varrho^{(0)}$. Based on these bounds we have shown that decomposition of private quantum channels into orthogonal unitaries (if exists) is optimizing the entropy. For non-ancillary single qubit PQC we have derived the optimal entropy for arbitrary set of plaintexts. In particular, we have shown that except when the (closure of the) set of plaintexts contains all states, one bit key is sufficient. We characterized and analyzed all the possible single qubit private quantum channels for arbitrary set of plaintexts. For the set of plaintexts consisting of all qubit states we have characterized all possible approximate private quantum channels and we have derived the relation between the security parameter and the corresponding minimal entropy.

The nonlinear equation generates a dynamical group providing a unique deterministic description of irreversible, conservative relaxation towards equilibrium from any non-equilibrium state, and satisfies a very restrictive stability requirement equivalent to Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the second law of thermodynamics. Here, we emphasize its mathematical structure and its applicability also within other contexts, such as Classical and Quantum Statistical Mechanics, and Information Theory.

abstract: We show that the angular spectrum of type-II SPDC contains a continuum of maximally entangled states. For the realization of a bright source of entangled two-photon states, a standard technique is to compensate for the transverse walk-off in the production crystal. We demonstrate that polarization entangled states can be effectively engineered by generalizing this approach. Our method allows to considerably enrich the set of generated entangled states with a controlled tailoring them.

abstract: With this chapter we provide a compact yet complete survey of two most remarkable "representation theorems": every arguesian projective geometry is represented by an essentially unique vector space, and every arguesian Hilbert geometry is represented by an essentially unique generalized Hilbert space. C. Piron's original representation theorem for propositional systems is then a corollary: it says that every irreducible, complete, atomistic, orthomodular lattice satisfying the covering law and of rank at least 4 is isomorphic to the lattice of closed subspaces of an essentially unique generalized Hilbert space. Piron's theorem combines abstract projective geometry with lattice theory. In fact, throughout this chapter we present the basic lattice theoretic aspects of abstract projective geometry: we prove the categorical equivalence of projective geometries and projective lattices, and the triple categorical equivalence of Hilbert geometries, Hilbert lattices and propositional systems.

abstract: A microfabricated Fabry-Perot optical resonator has been used for atom detection and photon production with less than 1 atom on average in the cavity mode. Our cavity design combines the intrinsic scalability of microfabrication processes with direct coupling of the cavity field to single-mode optical waveguides or fibers. The presence of the atom is seen through changes in both the intensity and the noise characteristics of probe light reflected from the cavity input mirror. An excitation laser passing transversely through the cavity triggers photon emission into the cavity mode and hence into the single-mode fiber. These are first steps towards building an optical microcavity network on an atom chip for applications in quantum information processing.

abstract: Quantum theory shares with classical probability theory many important properties. I show that this common core regards at least the following six areas, and I provide details on each of these: the logic of propositions, symmetry, probabilities, composition of systems, state preparation and reductionism. The essential distinction between classical and quantum theory, on the other hand, is shown to be joint decidability versus smoothness; for the latter in particular I supply ample explanation and motivation. Finally, I argue that beyond quantum theory there are no other generalisations of classical probability theory that are relevant to physics.

A `dephasing' contribution is identified from pumping processes that conserve the photon number and do not appear in the photon statistics. We work out examples for a single-atom maser with a precisely controlled coupling and for a laser where the interaction time is broadly distributed. In the latter case, we also assess the convergence of a recently developed uniform Lindblad approximation to the master equation; it is relatively slow.

abstract: In this talk we present a model to demonstrate how time-periodic potential can be used to manipulate quantum metastability of a system. We study metastability of a particle trapped in a well with a time-periodically oscillating barrier in the Floquet formalism. It is shown that the oscillating barrier causes the system to decay faster in general. However, avoided crossings of metastable states can occur with the less stable states crossing over to the more stable ones. If in the static well there exists a bound state, then it is possible to stabilize a metastable state by adiabatically increasing the oscillating frequency of the barrier so that the unstable state eventually cross-over to the stable bound state. It is also found that increasing the amplitude of the oscillating field may change a direct crossing of states into an avoided one. Hence, one can manipulate the stability of different states in a quantum potential by a combination of adiabatic changes of the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillating barrier.

As for $2 \times 2$ systems, the negativity vanishes in finite time for some entangled pure as well as mixed states. While locally equivalent pure states do so asymptotically. Interference between the decay of the two upper levels to the lowest one in the qutrit adds further richness to ESD in this systems.

abstract: The interaction between charged particles and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induces decoherence, and therefore affects the contrast of fringes in an interference experiment. In this article we show that if a double slit experiment is performed near a conducting grating, the fringe visibility is reduced. We find that the reduction of contrast is proportional to the number of grooves in the conducting surface, and that for realistic values of the parameters it could be large enough to be observed. The effect can be understood in terms of the Smith-Purcell radiation produced by the surface currents induced in the conductor.

abstract: Entangled photons can be generated "on demand" in a novel scheme involving unitary time reordering of the photons emitted in a radiative decay cascade. The scheme yields polarization entangled photon pairs, even though prior to reordering the emitted photons carry significant "which path information" and their polarizations are unentangled. This shows that quantum chronology can be manipulated in a way that is lossless and deterministic (unitary). The theory can, in principle, be tested and applied to the biexciton cascade in semiconductor quantum dots.

abstract: We investigate the multiple use of a ferromagnetic spin chain for quantum and classical communications without resetting. We find that the memory of the state transmitted during the first use makes the spin chain a qualitatively different quantum channel during the second transmission, for which we find the relevant Kraus operators. We propose a parameter to quantify the amount of memory in the channel and find that it influences the quality of the channel, as reflected through fidelity and entanglement transmissible during the second use. For certain evolution times, the memory allows the channel to exceed the memoryless classical capacity (achieved by separable inputs) and in some cases it can also enhance the quantum capacity.

The easy combination of individual addressing with the many-device setup proposed in the system presents a distinct merit in comparison with the implementation of topologically protected qubits in a trapped-ion system.

abstract: In this paper we consider an initially excited two-level system coupled to a monomode cavity, and compute exact expressions for the spectra spontaneously emitted by each system in the general case where they have arbitrary linewidths and frequencies. Our method is based on the fact that this problem has an easily solvable classical counterpart, which provides a clear interpretation of the evidenced phenomena. We show that if the cavity linewidth is much lower than the atomic linewidth, photons are emitted at the cavity frequency, even if the atom and the cavity are strongly detuned. We also study the links between the spontaneous emission spectra and the fluorescence spectra emitted when the atom is driven by a classical field of tunable frequency.

In Chapter 3 numerical and analytical means are used to generate estimates of and bounds on the threshold given an error model described by a restricted stochastic Pauli channel. Chapter 4 develops a simple, flexible means of estimating the threshold and applies it to some cases of interest. Finally, a novel method of ancilla construction is proposed in Chapter 5, and the difficulties associated with implementing it are discussed.

Our results provide a rare analytical case for the fidelity susceptibility in describing the universality class in quantum critical behavior. The different critical exponents in two phases are non-trivial results, indicating the fidelity susceptibility is not always extensive.

For the disorder QSWNs, the derivative of the spectrum averaged von Neumann entropy is maximal at a certain density of shortcut links p*, which can be as a signature of the localization delocalization transition of electron states. The transition point p* is agreement with that obtained by the level statistics method. For the quasiperiodic QSWNs, it is found that there are two regions of the potential parameter. The behaviors of electron states in different regions are similar to that of periodic and disorder QSWNs, respectively.

abstract: With the help of von Neumann entropy, we study numerically the localization properties of two interacting particles (TIP) with on-site interactions in one-dimensional disordered, quasiperiodic, and slowly varying potential systems, respectively. We find that for TIP in disordered and slowly varying potential systems, the spectrum-averaged von Neumann entropy <E_v> first increases with interaction U until its peak, then decreases as U gets larger. For TIP in the Harper model[S. N. Evangelou and D. E. Katsanos, Phys. Rev. B 56, 12797(1997)], the functions of <E_v> versus U are different for particles in extended and localized regimes. Our numerical results indicate that for these two-particle systems, the von Neumann entropy is a suitable quantity to characterize the localization properties of particle states. Moreover, our studies propose a consistent interpretation of the discrepancies between previous numerical results.

abstract: Quiet (or sub-Poissonian) oscillators generate a number of dissipation events whose variance is less than the mean. It was shown in 1984 by Golubev and Sokolov that lasers driven by regular pumps are quiet in that sense. The purpose of this paper is to show that, as long as the laser-detector system is strictly stationary, quantization of the optical field is not required to explain such phenomena. The theory presented here is semi-classical, yet exact. Previous theories considering excited-state atoms regularly-injected in resonators, on the other hand, do require in principle light quantization. Specifically, we consider a laser involving a single electron permanently interacting with the field and driven by a constant-potential battery, and point out a similarity with reflex klystrons. The detected noise is found to be only 7/8 of the shot-noise level. It is therefore sub-Poissonian. Our calculations are related to resonance-fluorescence treatments but with different physical interpretations.

abstract: Wheeler has strikingly illustrated the wave-particle duality by the delayed-choice thought experiment, in which the configuration of a 2-path interferometer is chosen after a single-photon light-pulsed has entered it. We present a quantitative theoretical analysis of an experimental realization of Wheeler's proposal.

abstract: We give a quantum algorithm for evaluating formulas over an extended gate set, including all two- and three-bit binary gates (e.g., NAND, 3-majority). The algorithm is optimal on read-once formulas for which each gate's inputs are balanced in a certain sense. The main new tool is a correspondence between a classical linear-algebraic model of computation, "span programs," and weighted bipartite graphs. A span program's evaluation corresponds to an eigenvalue-zero eigenvector of the associated graph. A quantum computer can therefore evaluate the span program by applying spectral estimation to the graph. For example, the classical complexity of evaluating the balanced ternary majority formula is unknown, and the natural generalization of randomized alpha-beta pruning is known to be suboptimal. In contrast, our algorithm generalizes the optimal quantum AND-OR formula evaluation algorithm and is optimal for evaluating the balanced ternary majority formula.

abstract: We use the numerical gradient ascent method from optimal control theory to extend efficient photon storage in Lambda-type media to previously inaccessible regimes and to provide simple intuitive explanations for our optimization techniques. In particular, by using gradient ascent to shape classical control pulses used to mediate photon storage, we open up the possibility of high efficiency photon storage in the non-adiabatic limit, in which analytical solutions to the equations of motion do not exist. This control shaping technique enables an order-of-magnitude increase in the bandwidth of the memory. We also demonstrate that the often discussed connection between time reversal and optimality in photon storage follows naturally from gradient ascent. Finally, we discuss the optimization of controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening.

abstract: We present an approach for the highly sensitive photon detection based on the quantum dots (QDs) operating at temperature of 77K. The detection structure is based on an AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double barrier resonant tunneling diode combined with a layer of self-assembled InAs QDs (QD-RTD). A photon rate of 115 photons per second had induced 10nA photocurrent in this structure, corresponding to the photo-excited carrier multiplication factor of 10^7. This high multiplication factor is achieved by the quantum dot induced memory effect and the resonant tunneling tuning effect of QD-RTD structure.

abstract: In this paper, we report stochastic resonance (SR) in a single electron turnstile. It has been known that SR emerges by the cooperation of a weak periodic signal and noise in a bistable system. A periodic signal produces switching between two stable states by lowering the potential barrier. Even if the amplitude of the signal is not large enough to make the potential barrier disappear, the switching can occur with the help of noise. As a result, an output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which shows how much the switching is synchronized with the signal, can be enhanced by increasing the noise. We have formulated the SR in a single electron turnstile into the adiabatic two-state theory of McNamara-Wiesenfeld and confirmed its manifestation by numerical simulation. These results could be applied to detection of the periodic motion of very small electric charge under noisy environment.

abstract: Recently 't Hooft demonstrated that ``For any quantum system there exists at least one deterministic model that reproduces all its dynamics after prequantization''. An extension is presented here which covers quantum systems that are characterized by a complete set of mutually commuting Hermitian operators (``beables''). We introduce the symmetry of beables: any complete set of beables is as good as any other one which is obtained through a real general linear group transformation. The quantum numbers of a specific set are related to symmetry breaking initial and boundary conditions in a deterministic model. The Hamiltonian, in particular, can be taken as the emergent beable which provides the best resolution of the evolution of the model universe.

abstract: We consider two-mode squeezed states which are parametrized by the squeezing parameter and the phase. We present a scheme for teleporting such entangled states of continuous variables from Alice to Bob. Our protocol is operationalized through the creation of a four-mode entangled state shared by Alice and Bob using linear amplifiers and beam splitters. Teleportation of the entangled state proceeds with local operations and the classical communication of four bits. We compute the fidelity of teleportation and find that it exhibits a trade-off with the magnitude of entanglement of the resultant teleported state.

abstract: Interference dynamics is analyzed in the light of the complex quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, using as a working model the collision of two Gaussian wave packets. Though simple, this model nicely shows that interference in quantum scattering processes gives rise to rich dynamics and trajectory topologies in the complex plane, both ruled by two types of singularities: caustics and vortices, where the former are associated with the regime of free wave-packet propagation, and the latter with the collision (interference) process. Furthermore, an unambiguous picture connecting the complex and real frameworks is also provided and discussed.

abstract: Recently, we have developed a unified approach to QED in arbitrary linearly responding media in equilibrium--media that give rise to absorption [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{75}, (2007) 053813]. In the present paper we show that, under appropriate conditions, the theory can be quite naturally generalized to amplifying media the effect of which is described within the framework of linear response theory. We discuss the limits of validity of the generalized theory and make contact with earlier quantization schemes suggested for the case of linearly and locally responding amplifying dielectric-type media. To illustrate the theory, we present the electromagnetic-field correlation functions that determine the Casimir force in the presence of amplifying media.

abstract: We propose and demonstrate experimentally a projection scheme to measure the quantum phase with a precision beating the standard quantum limit. The initial input state is a twin Fock state $|N,N>$ proposed by Holland and Burnett [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 71}, 1355 (1993)] but the phase information is extracted by a quantum state projection measurement. The phase precision is about $1.4/N$ for large photon number $N$, which approaches the Heisenberg limit of 1/N. Experimentally, we employ a four-photon state from type-II parametric down-conversion and achieve a phase uncertainty of $0.291\pm 0.001$ beating the standard quantum limit of $1/\sqrt{N} = 1/2$ for four photons.

Auxiliary results include a derivation of the conjugacy classes of ${\rm ESL}(2, \mathbb{F}_N)$.

abstract: We determine the capacity of compound classical-quantum channels. As a consequence we obtain the capacity formula for the averaged classical-quantum channels. The capacity result for compound channels demonstrates, as in the classical setting, the existence of reliable universal classical-quantum codes in scenarios where the only a priori information about the channel used for the transmission of information is that it belongs to a given set of memoryless classical-quantum channels. Our approach is based on the universal classical approximation of the quantum relative entropy which in turn relies on the universal hypothesis testing results.

abstract: A single broadband squeezed field constitutes a quantum communication resource that is sufficient for the realization of a large number N of quantum channels based on distributed Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states. Each channel can serve as a resource for, e.g. independent quantum key distribution or teleportation protocols. N-fold channel multiplexing can be realized by accessing 2N squeezed modes at different Fourier frequencies. We report on the experimental implementation of the N=1 case through the interference of two squeezed states, extracted from a single broadband squeezed field, and demonstrate all techniques required for multiplexing (N>1). Quantum channel frequency multiplexing can be used to optimize the exploitation of a broadband squeezed field in a quantum information task. For instance, it is useful if the bandwidth of the squeezed field is larger than the bandwidth of the homodyne detectors. This is currently a typical situation in many experiments with squeezed and two-mode squeezed entangled light.

abstract: We investigate the interplay dynamics of a cavity qed system, where the two-level atoms are trapped in a double-well potential, and the cavity mode, with a frequency largely detuned to the atomic level splitting, is driven by a probe laser. The interaction between the center-of-mass motion of the atoms and the cavity mode is induced by the position dependent atom-field coupling. The dynamics of the system is characterized by two distinct time scales, the inverse of the atomic interwell tunneling rate and the inverse of the cavity loss rate. The system shows drastically different (quasi) steady behaviors in the short-time and long-time intervals.

abstract: For a free falling particle moving in a media which has quadratic velocity force effect on the particle, two equivalent constants of motion, with units of energy, two Lagrangians, and two Hamiltonians are deduced. These quantities describe the dynamics of the same classical system. However, their quantization and the associated statistical mechanics (for an ensemble of particles) describe two completely different quantum and statistical systems. This is shown at first order in the dissipative parameter.

It is then shown that the phase operator of a supersymmetric harmonic oscillator is a Goldstone operator at any strictly positive temperature (finite or infinite).

abstract: Although intrinsic spin is usually viewed as a purely quantum property with no classical analog, we present evidence here that fermion spin has a classical origin rooted in the geometry of three-dimensional physical space. Our approach to the quantum/classical interface is based on a formulation of relativistic classical mechanics that uses spinors. Spinors and projectors arise naturally in the Clifford's geometric algebra of physical space and not only provide powerful tools for solving problems in classical electrodynamics, but also reproduce a number of quantum results. In particular, many properites of elementary fermions, as spin-1/2 particles, are obtained classically and relate spin, the associated g-factor, its coupling to an external magnetic field, and its magnetic moment to Zitterbewegung and de Broglie waves. The relationship is further strengthened by the fact that physical space and its geometric algebra can be derived from fermion annihilation and creation operators. The approach resolves Pauli's argument against treating time as an operator by recognizing phase factors as projected rotation operators.

We determine the temporal behaviour of the fidelity during the algorithm, and we compute the final fidelity as a function of the Rabi frequency. For the latter, we obtained pronounced maxima at frequencies which fulfil the condition of the (2\pi k)-method with respect to the second nearest neighbour interactions.

Using this SU(1,1) description of these transformations, we obtain a new basis for such transformations that lies in a useful representation of this group and lies outside the often-used restriction to Gaussian states. We analyze this basis, show its application to a class of transformations, and discuss its extension to more general quantum optical networks.

Furthermore, when these symmetry conditions are applicable, Leggett's non-local theory also cannot model the observed quantum correlations in previous experiments.

For the first time, nuclear spin coherence is optically excited, detected and characterized in such a crystal. The lifetime of the spin coherence -- the potential storage entity -- is measured by means of Raman echo to be about 300 $\mu$s over a wide range of ground state splittings. This flexibility, attractive for broadband operation, and well fitted to existing quantum sources, results from the simple hyperfine structure, contrasting with Pr- and Eu- doped crystals.

abstract: We investigate continuous variable (CV) quantum teleportation using relevant classes of non-Gaussian states of the radiation field as entangled resources. First, we introduce the class two-mode squeezed symmetric superposition of Fock states, including finite truncations of twin-beam Gaussian states as special realizations. These states depend on a set of free independent parameters that can be adjusted for the optimization of teleportation protocols, with an enhancement of the success probability of teleportation both for coherent and Fock input states. We show that the optimization procedure reduces the entangled resources to truncated twin beam states, which thus represents an optimal class of non-Gaussian resources for quantum teleportation. We then introduce a further class of two-mode non-Gaussian entangled resources, in the form of squeezed cat-like states. We analyze the performance and the properties of such states when optimized for (CV) teleportation, and compare them to the optimized squeezed Bell-like states introduced in a previous work \cite{CVTelepNoi}. We discuss how optimal resources for teleportation are characterized by a suitable balance of entanglement content and squeezed vacuum affinity. We finally investigate the effects of thermal noise on the efficiency of quantum teleportation. To this aim, a convenient framework is to describe noisy entangled resources as linear superpositions of non-Gaussian state and thermal states. Although the presence of the thermal component strongly reduces the teleportation fidelity, noisy non-Gaussian states remain preferred resources when compared to noisy twin-beam Gaussian states.

abstract: In most studies of the capacity of quantum channels, it is assumed that the errors in each use of the channel are independent. However, recent work has begun to investigate the effects of memory or correlations in the error, and has led to suggestions that there can be interesting non-analytic behaviour in the capacity of such channels. In a previous paper we pursued this issue by connecting the study of channel capacities under correlated error to the study of critical behaviour in many-body physics. This connection enables the use of techniques from many-body physics to either completely solve or understand qualitatively a number of interesting models of correlated error with analogous behaviour to associated many-body systems. However, in order for this approach to work rigorously, there are a number of technical properties that need to be established for the lattice systems being considered. In this article we discuss these properties in detail, and establish them for some classes of many-body system.

A prescription is given for constructing the quantum distribution associated with a sequence of measurements. For the case of quantum Brownian motion this prescription is illustrated with a number of explicit examples. In particular it is shown how the prescription can be extended in the form of a general formula for the Wigner function of a Brownian particle entangled with a heat bath.

Our argument is based on a treatment of the Schroedinger dynamics of the composite of a quantum microsystem, S, and a macroscopic measuring apparatus, I, consisting of N interacting particles. The pointer positions of this apparatus are represented by orthogonal subspaces of its representative Hilbert space that are simultaneous eigenspaces of coarse-grained macroscopic observables. By taking explicit account of their macroscopicality via a large deviation principle, we prove that, for a suitably designed apparatus I, the evolution of the composite (S+I) leads both to the reduction of the wave packet of S and to a one-to-one correspondence between the resultant state of this microsystem and the pointer position of I, up to utterly negligible corrections that decrease exponentially with N.

abstract: We investigate the relation between Bell inequalities and nonlocal games by presenting a systematic method for their bilateral conversion. In particular, we show that while to any nonlocal game there naturally corresponds a unique Bell inequality, the converse is not true. As an illustration of the method we present a number of nonlocal games that admit better odds when played using quantum resources

abstract: There can exist topological obstructions to continuously deforming a gapped Hamiltonian for free fermions into a trivial form without closing the gap. These topological obstructions are closely related to obstructions to the existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions. We show that by taking two copies of a gapped, free fermionic system with complex conjugate Hamiltonians, it is always possible to overcome these obstructions. This allows us to write the ground state in matrix product form using Grassman-valued bond variables, and show insensitivity of the ground state density matrix to boundary conditions.

abstract: Manin, Feynman, and Deutsch have viewed quantum computing as a kind of universal physical simulation procedure. Much of the writing about quantum logic circuits and quantum Turing machines has shown how these machines can simulate an arbitrary unitary transformation on a finite number of qubits. The problem of universality has been addressed most famously in a paper by Deutsch, and later by Bernstein and Vazirani as well as Kitaev and Solovay. The quantum logic circuit model, developed by Feynman and Deutsch, has been more prominent in the research literature than Deutsch's quantum Turing machines. Quantum Turing machines form a class closely related to deterministic and probabilistic Turing machines and one might hope to find a universal machine in this class. A universal machine is the basis of a notion of programmability. The extent to which universality has in fact been established by the pioneers in the field is examined and this key notion in theoretical computer science is scrutinised in quantum computing by distinguishing various connotations and concomitant results and problems.

abstract: In spite of the fact that statistical predictions of quantum theory (QT) can only be tested if large amount of data is available a claim has been made that QT provides the most complete description of an individual physical system. Einstein's opposition to this claim and the paradox he presented in the article written together with Podolsky and Rosen in 1935 inspired generations of physicists in their quest for better understanding of QT. Seventy years after EPR article it is clear that without deep understanding of the character and limitations of QT one may not hope to find a meaningful unified theory of all physical interactions, manipulate qubits or construct a quantum computer. In this paper we present shortly the EPR paper and the discussion which followed it. By emphasizing the difference between quantum phenomena and hypothetical invisible sub phenomena we show that paradoxes are only found if incorrect models of sub phenomena are used. The violation of Bell and CHSH inequalities demonstrate clearly that "an entangled pair of photons" resembles neither "a pair of Bertlmann's socks" nor "a pair of fair and random dices". Finally we rephrase the EPR question by asking whether QT provides the complete description of experimental data.

abstract: Recently, Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters introduced the residual entanglement for three qubits to quantify the three-qubit entanglement in Phys. Rev. A 61, 052306 (2000). In Phys. Rev. A 65, 032304 (2007), we defined the residual entanglement for $n$ qubits, whose values are between 0 and 1. In this paper, we want to show that the residual entanglement for $n$ qubits is a natural measure of entanglement by demonstrating the following properties. (1). It is SL-invariant, especially LU-invariant. (2). It is an entanglement monotone. (3). It is invariant under permutations of the qubits. (4). It vanishes or is multiplicative for product states.

abstract: We show by general arguments that networks whose density of states contains few highly degenerate eigenvalues result in inefficient performances of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) over these networks, while systems whose eigenvalues all have the same degeneracy lead to very efficient transport. We exemplify our results by considering CTQW and, for comparison, its classical counterpart, continuous-time random walks, over simple structures, whose eigenvalues and eigenstates can be calculated analytically. Extensions to more complicated, hyper-branched networks are discussed.

abstract: Construction of multi-particle entangled states and direct teleportation of N-(spin 1/2) particles are important areas of quantum information processing. A number of different schemes which have been presented already, address the problem through controlled teleportation. In this article, a criterion based on standard quantum statistical correlations employed in the many body virial expansions is used to determine maximum entanglement for a N-particle state. These states remain entangled through proper traces to states for a smaller number of particles and can be generalized for arbitrary number of particles. It is shown that they are quite useful in generalized, N-particle, direct teleportation. The corresponding quantum gates are also indicated for teleportation schemes from simple computational basis states.

We demonstrate that under the circumstances of the resonant coupling of the excited atom to the surface polariton mode of a vacuum-medium system the nonretarded atom*-atom interaction energy can be enhanced by (several) orders of magnitude in comparison with the van der Waals interaction energy of the two isolated atoms.

abstract: The quantum theory (QT) and new stochastic approaches have no deterministic prediction for a single measurement or for a single time -series of events observed for a trapped ion, electron or any other individual physical system. The predictions of QT being of probabilistic character apply to the statistical distribution of the results obtained in various experiments. The probability distribution is not an attribute of a dice but it is a characteristic of a whole random experiment : '' rolling a dice''. and statistical long range correlations between two random variables X and Y are not a proof of any causal relation between these variable. Moreover any probabilistic model used to describe a random experiment is consistent only with a specific protocol telling how the random experiment has to be performed.In this sense the quantum theory is a statistical and contextual theory of phenomena. In this paper we discuss these important topics in some detail. Besides we discuss in historical perspective various prerequisites used in the proofs of Bell and CHSH inequalities concluding that the violation of these inequalities in spin polarization correlation experiments is neither a proof of the completeness of QT nor of its nonlocality. The question whether QT is predictably complete is still open and it should be answered by a careful and unconventional analysis of the experimental data. It is sufficient to analyze more in detail the existing experimental data by using various non-parametric purity tests and other specific statistical tools invented to study the fine structure of the time-series. The correct understanding of statistical and contextual character of QT has far reaching consequences for the quantum information and quantum computing.

High resolution laser spectroscopy and optical microscopy were combined at T = 1.4 K to identify individual molecules in two independent microscopes. The Stark effect was exploited to shift the transition frequency of a given molecule and thus obtain single photon sources with perfect spectral overlap. Our experimental arrangement sets the ground for the realization of various quantum interference and information processing experiments.

abstract: We investigate the influence of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) on the properties of immersed impurity atoms, which are trapped in an optical lattice. Assuming a weak coupling of the impurity atoms to the BEC, we derive a quantum master equation for the lattice system. In the special case of fixed impurities with two internal states the atoms represent a quantum register and the quantum master equation reproduces the exact evolution of the qubits. We characterise the qubit dephasing which is caused by the interspecies coupling and show that the effect of sub- and superdecoherence is observable for realistic experimental parameters. Furthermore, the BEC phonons mediate an attractive interaction between the impurities, which has an important impact on their spatial distribution. If the lattice atoms are allowed to move, there occurs a sharp transition with the impurities aggregating in a macroscopic cluster at experimentally achievable temperatures. We also investigate the impact of the BEC on the transport properties of the impurity atoms and show that a crossover from coherent to diffusive behaviour occurs with increasing interaction strength.

abstract: We extend the findings and analyses of our two recent studies (Phys. Rev. A, 75, 032326 [2007] and arXiv:0704.3723) by, first, obtaining numerical estimates of the separability function based on the (Euclidean, flat) Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) metric for the 27-dimensional convex set of quaternionic two-qubit systems. The estimated function appears to be strongly consistent with our previously-formulated Dyson-index (beta = 1, 2, 4) ansatz, dictating that the quaternionic (beta=4) separability function should be exactly proportional to the square of the separability function for the 15-dimensional convex set of two-qubit complex (beta=2) systems, as well as the fourth power of the separability function for the 9-dimensional convex set of two-qubit real (beta=1) systems. In particular, we conclude that S_{quat}(mu) =(6/71)^2 ((3-mu^2) mu)^4 =(S_{complex}(mu))^2. Here, mu =(rho_{11} rho_{44}/(rho_{22} rho_{33})^(1/2), where rho is a 4 x 4 two-qubit density matrix. We can, thus, supplement (and fortify) our previous assertion that the HS separability probability of the two-qubit complex states is 8/33= 0.242424, by claiming that its quaternionic counterpart is 72442944/936239725 = 0.0773765. We also comment on and analyze the odd beta=1 and 3 cases.

We predict this protocol to allow the creation of multiatom MQS by measuring the number of atoms coherently outcoupled from a two-component (spinor) Bose-Einstein condensate.

abstract: Under broad conditions, evolutions due to two different Hamiltonians are shown to lead at some moment to orthogonal states. For two spin-1/2 systems subject to precession by different magnetic fields the achievement of orthogonalization is demonstrated for every scenario but a special one. This discrimination between evolutions is experimentally much simpler than procedures proposed earlier based on either sequential or parallel application of the unknown unitaries. A lower bound for the orthogonalization time is proposed in terms of the properties of the two Hamiltonians.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3661
abstract: In the Feshbach projection operator formalism, resonance as well as decay phenomena are described by means of the complex eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the non-Hermitian Hamilton operator $H_{\rm eff}$ that appears in an intermediate stage of the formalism. The formalism can be applied for the description of isolated resonances as well as for resonances in the overlapping regime. Time asymmetry is related to the time operator which is a part of $H_{\rm eff}$. An expression for the decay rates of resonance states is derived. For isolated resonance states $\lambda$, this expression gives the fundamental relation $\tau_\lambda = \hbar / \Gamma_\lambda$ between life time and width of a resonance state. A similar relation holds for the average values obtained for narrow resonances superposed by a smooth background term. In the cross over between these two cases (regime of overlapping resonances), the decay rate decreases monotonously as a function of increasing time.

abstract: A two level system resonantly coupled to a single mode cavity field and subject to ground state occupancy measurement like interaction is considered. For this situation, the solution to the Lindblad master equation for the density matrix is obtained with respect to the Jaynes Cummings eigenstate representation. It is seen that, the rate of decoherence of the superposition of the Jaynes Cummings eigenstates increases monotonically with the increase in the occupancy measurement coupling up to a certain critical value (already reported in the literature in a different context), whereas the rate decreases with the increase in the measurement coupling beyond the same critical value.

We show that an atom-cavity system interacting with an environment characterized by a non-flat spectrum, in the non-Markovian limit, exhibits such a behavior, effectively realizing the preservation of nonclassical states against dissipation. Our results allow to understand the role of cavity losses in hybrid solid state systems and pave the way to the proper description of leakage in the recently developed cavity quantum electrodynamic systems.

abstract: Efficient simulations of quantum evolutions of spin-1/2 systems are relevant for ensemble quantum computation as well as in typical NMR experiments. We propose an efficient method to calculate the dynamics of an observable provided that the initial excitation is "local". It resorts a single entangled pure initial state built as a superposition, with random phases, of the pure elements that compose the mixture. This ensures self-averaging of any observable, drastically reducing the calculation time. The procedure is tested for two representative systems: a spin star (cluster with random long range interactions) and a spin ladder.

abstract: In this paper we give fully analytical description of the dynamics of a collection of $N$-Frenkel excitons in high density regime dispersively coupled to a single mode cavity field, in the presence of both exciton and cavity-field dissipations. By using excitonic operators as q-deformed bosonic operators for the system, we solve analytically the Liouville equation for the density operator at zero temperature and investigate the influence of the number of excitons and the effect of both dissipations on dynamical behavior of the system. We use the solution of master equation to explore the dissipative dynamics of non-classical properties such as, molecule-field entanglement, quadrature squeezing of the field, and molecular dipole squeezing. We find that the non-classical properties are strongly affected by the number of excitons and also by the existence of both dissipations.

By using time-resolved Kerr rotation we observe the initial phase of Larmor precession of electron spins whose coherence is transferred from light. To break the electron-hole spin entanglement, we utilized the big discrepancy between the transverse g-factors of electrons and light holes. The result encourages us to make a quantum media converter between flying photon qubits and stationary electron spin qubits in semiconductors.

abstract: Quantum field theory is assumed to be gauge invariant. However it is well known that when certain quantities, such as the vacuum current, are calculated the results are not gauge invariant. The non-gauge invariant terms have to be removed in order to obtain a physically correct result. It has been shown in Ref. [3] and [4] that this problem may be due to a mathematical inconsistency in the canonical formulation of QFT. In this article we will review this previous work and then examine an alternative formulation of QFT called the functional Schroedinger approach. It will be shown that this approach produces different results then the canonical formulation. In particular it will be shown that in the functional Schroedinger approach the vacuum current is gauge invariant.

We design building blocks for two noncommutable single-logic-qubit gates and a logic controlled phase gate, based on which a universal and scalable quantum information processing robust to dephasing is available in a deterministic way.

After a description of the experimental apparatus we report on a measurement made with thermal photons, discussing its implications for the zero-point photons case. Finally we show the preliminary results for the zero-point case.

abstract: We point out that density matrices can only be used to describe quantum states, so the entanglement contained in a density matrix is just quantum entanglement. This means a bipartite state described by a density matrix contains quantum entanglement, unless the density matrix has the form $\rho_{AB}=\rho_A\otimes \rho_B$.

abstract: A real-time polarization control system employing two nonorthogonal reference signals multiplexed in either time or wavelength with the data signal is presented. It is shown, theoretically and experimentally, that complete control of multiple polarization states can be attained employing polarization controllers in closed-loop configuration. Experimental results show that negligible added penalties, corresponding to an average added optical Quantum Bit Error Rate of 0.044%, can be achieved with response times smaller than 10 ms, without significant introduction of noise counts in the quantum channel.

abstract: We show that one-dimensional Bohmian mechanics is unique, in that, the Bohm trajectories are the only solutions that conserve total left (or right) probability. In Brandt et al., Phys. Lett. A, 249 (1998) 265--270, they define quantile motion--unique trajectories are solved by assuming that the total probability on each side of the particle is conserved. They argue that the quantile trajectories are identical to the Bohm trajectories. Their argument, however, fails to notice the gauge freedom in the definition of the quantum probability current. Our paper sidesteps this under-determinedness of the probability current. The one-dimensional probability conservation can be used for higher dimensional problems if the wave function is separable. Several examples are given using total left probability conservation, most notably, the two-slit experiment.

abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of a quantum Chernoff theorem for asymptotic state discrimination, we investigate the distinguishability of two bipartite mixed states under the constraint of local operations and classical communication (LOCC), in the limit of many copies. While for two pure states a result of Walgate et al. shows that LOCC is just as powerful as global measurements, data hiding states (DiVincenzo et al.) show that locality can impose severe restrictions on the distinguishability of even orthogonal states. Here we determine the optimal error probability and measurement to discriminate many copies of particular data hiding states (extremal d x d Werner states) by a linear programming approach. Surprisingly, the single-copy optimal measurement remains optimal for n copies, in the sense that the best strategy is measuring each copy separately, followed by a simple classical decision rule. We also put a lower bound on the bias with which states can be distinguished by separable operations.

abstract: We theoretically investigate image propagation and storage in hot atomic vapor. A $4f$ system is adopted for imaging and an atomic vapor cell is placed over the transform plane. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of an object in the object plane can thus be transformed into atomic Raman coherence according to the idea of ``light storage''. We investigate how the stored diffraction pattern evolves under diffusion. Our result indicates, under appropriate conditions, that an image can be reconstructed with high fidelity. The main reason for this procedure to work is the fact that diffusion of opposite-phase components of the diffraction pattern interfere destructively.

abstract: We study an ultracold gas of neutral atoms subject to the periodic optical potential generated by a high-$Q$ cavity mode. In the limit of very low temperatures, cavity field and atomic dynamics require a quantum description. Starting from a cavity QED single atom Hamiltonian we use different routes to derive approximative multiparticle Hamiltonians in Bose-Hubbard form with rescaled or even dynamical parameters. In the limit of large enough cavity damping the different models agree. Compared to free space optical lattices, quantum uncertainties of the potential and the possibility of atom-field entanglement lead to modified phase transition characteristics, the appearance of new phases or even quantum superpositions of different phases. Using a corresponding effective master equation, which can be numerically solved for few particles, we can study time evolution including dissipation. As an example we exhibit the microscopic processes behind the transition dynamics from a Mott insulator like state to a self-ordered superradiant state of the atoms, which appears as steady state for transverse atomic pumping.

We enumerate these coordinate systems and we are able to present the path integral representations explicitly in the majority of the cases. In each solution the expansion into the wave-functions is stated. Also, the kernel and the corresponding Green function can be stated in closed form in terms of the invariant distance on the sphere, respectively on the hyperboloid.

abstract: Ashikhmin and Litsyn showed that all binary stabilizer codes - pure or impure - of sufficiently large length obey the quantum Hamming bound, ruling out the possibility that impure codes of large length can outperform pure codes with respect to sphere packing. In contrast we show that impure subsystem codes do not obey the quantum Hamming bound for pure subsystem codes, not even asymptotically. We show that there exist arbitrarily long Bacon-Shor codes that violate the quantum Hamming bound.

abstract: Belief propagation -- a powerful heuristic method to solve inference problems involving a large number of random variables -- was recently generalized to quantum theory. Like its classical counterpart, this algorithm is exact on trees when the appropriate independence conditions are met and is expected to provide reliable approximations when operated on loopy graphs. In this paper, we benchmark the performances of loopy quantum belief propagation (QBP) in the context of finite-tempereture quantum many-body physics. Our results indicate that QBP provides reliable estimates of the high-temperature correlation function when the typical loop size in the graph is large. As such, it is suitable e.g. for the study of quantum spin glasses on Bethe lattices and the decoding of sparse quantum error correction codes.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.4352
abstract: The act of measuring optical emissions from two remote qubits can entangle them. By demanding that a photon from each qubit reaches the detectors, one can ensure than no photon was lost. But the failure rate then rises quadratically with loss probability. In [1] this resulted in 30 successes per billion attempts. We describe a means to exploit the low grade entanglement heralded by the detection of a lone photon: A subsequent perfect operation is quickly achieved by consuming this noisy resource. We require only two qubits per node, and can tolerate both path length variation and loss asymmetry. The impact of photon loss upon the failure rate is then linear; realistic high-loss devices can gain orders of magnitude in performance and thus support QIP.

abstract: We analyse recently proposed physical implementations of a quantum computer based on polar molecules. A set of general requirements for a molecular system is presented, which would provide an optimal combination of quantum gate times, coherence times, number of operations, high gate accuracy and experimental feasibility. We proceed with a detailed analysis of a scheme utilizing switchable dipole-dipole interactions between polar molecules. Switchable dipole-dipole interaction is an efficient tool for realization of two-qubit quantum gates, necessary to construct a universal set of gates. We consider three possible realizations of a phase gate using specific molecules, such as CO, NF, alkali dimers and alkaline-earth monohalides. We suggest suitable electronic states and ransitions and investigate requirements for the pulses driving them. Finally, we analyse possible sources of decoherence.

abstract: We report the experimental characterization of axialization - a method of reducing the magnetron motion of a small number of ions stored in a Penning trap. This is an important step in the investigation of the suitability of Penning traps for quantum information processing. The magnetron motion was coupled to the laser-cooled modified cyclotron motion by the application of a near-resonant oscillating quadrupole potential (the "axialization drive"). Measurement of cooling rates of the radial motions of the ions showed an order-of-magnitude increase in the damping rate of the magnetron motion with the axialization drive applied. The experimental results are in good qualitative agreement with a recent theoretical study. In particular, a classical avoided crossing was observed in the motional frequencies as the axialization drive frequency was swept through the optimum value, proving that axialization is indeed a resonant effect.

In order to make them even more practical, it is necessary to enhance our ability to inject multiple pulses into the condensate. In this paper, we report that dispersion of pulses injected into the condensate can be compensated by optical nonlinearity. In addition, we will present a brief review of our earlier results in which enhancement of light storage capacity is accomplished by utilizing multi-mode light propagation or choosing an optimal set of experimental parameters.

abstract: We consider the possibility of using stabilizer states to perform deterministic dense coding among multiple senders and a single receiver. In the model we studied, the utilized stabilizer state is partitioned into several subsystems and then each subsystem is held by a distinct party. We present a sufficient condition for a stabilizer state to be useful for deterministic distributed dense coding with respect to a given partition plan. The corresponding protocol is also constructed. Furthermore, we propose a method to partially solve a more general problem of finding the set of achievable alphabet sizes for an arbitrary stabilizer state with respect to an arbitrary partition plan. Finally, our work provides a new perspective from the stabilizer formalism to view the standard dense coding protocol and also unifies several previous results in a single framework.

abstract: We propose a scheme for the generation of a two-mode field squeezed state in cavity QED. It is based on two-channel Raman excitations of a beam of three-level atoms with random arrival times by two classical fields and two high-Q resonator modes. It is shown that by suitably choosing the intensities and detunings of fields the dynamical processes can be selective and two-mode squeezing between the cavity modes can be generated at steady state. This proposal does not need the preparation of the initial states of atoms and cavity modes, and is robust against atomic spontaneous decay.

abstract: We demonstrate long-lived coherence in internal hyperfine states of a single \Ca{43} trapped-ion qubit $[T_2=1.2(2)\s]$, and in external motional states of a single \Ca{40} trapped-ion qubit $[T_2'=0.18(4)\s]$, in the same apparatus. The motional decoherence rate is consistent with the heating rate, which was measured to be 3(1) quanta/sec. Long coherence times in the external motional states are essential for performing high-fidelity quantum logic gates between trapped-ion qubits. The internal-state $T_2$ time that we observe in \Ca{43}, which has not previously been used as a trapped-ion qubit, is about one thousand times longer than that of physical qubits based on \Ca{40} ions. Using a single spin-echo pulse to ``re-phase'' the internal state, we can detect no decoherence after 1\s, implying an effective coherence time $T_2^{\mbox{\tiny SE}} \gtish 45\s$. This compares with timescales in this trap for single-qubit operations of \ish 1\us, and for two-qubit operations of \ish 10\us.

We first examine the effect by a stationary phase analysis, with results consistent with those of an earlier analysis of the system. We supplement this analysis by considering the transit of a gaussian wave and find bounds for the validity of the stationary phase result. The propagation of the gaussian wave is illustrated by figures.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.4473
abstract: We present first worldline analytical and numerical results for the nontrivial interplay between geometry and temperature dependencies of the Casimir effect. We show that the temperature dependence of the Casimir force can be significantly larger for open geometries (e.g., perpendicular plates) than for closed geometries (e.g., parallel plates). For surface separations in the experimentally relevant range, the thermal correction for the perpendicular-plates configuration exhibits a stronger parameter dependence and exceeds that for parallel plates by an order of magnitude at room temperature. This effect can be attributed to the fact that the fluctuation spectrum for closed geometries is gapped, inhibiting the thermal excitation of modes at low temperatures. By contrast, open geometries support a thermal excitation of the low-lying modes in the gapless spectrum already at low temperatures.

abstract: The energy spectrum of the electromagnetic normal modes plays a central role in the theory of the van der Waals and Casimir interaction. In dissipative media it appears as if there are distinct normal modes with complex valued energies. The summation of the zero-point energies of these modes render a complex valued result. Using the contour integration, resulting from the use of the generalized argument principle, gives a real valued and different result. We resolve this contradiction and show that the spectrum of true normal modes form a continuum with real frequencies. We illustrate the problem in connection with the van der Waals interaction between two metal half spaces.

abstract: We study the transport of ultracold impurity atoms immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and trapped in a tight optical lattice. Within the strong-coupling regime, we derive an extended Hubbard model describing the dynamics of the impurities in terms of polarons, i.e. impurities dressed by a coherent state of Bogoliubov phonons. Using a generalized master equation based on this microscopic model we show that inelastic and dissipative phonon scattering results in (i) a crossover from coherent to incoherent transport of impurities with increasing BEC temperature and (ii) the emergence of a net atomic current across a tilted optical lattice. The dependence of the atomic current on the lattice tilt changes from ohmic conductance to negative differential conductance within an experimentally accessible parameter regime. This transition is accurately described by an Esaki-Tsu-type relation with the effective relaxation time of the impurities as a temperature-dependent parameter.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.4554
abstract: Two kinds of maps that describe evolution of states of a subsystem coming from dynamics described by a unitary operator for a larger system, maps defined for fixed mean values and maps defined for fixed correlations, are found to be quite different for the same unitary dynamics in the same situation in the larger system. An affine form is used for both kinds of maps to find necessary and sufficient conditions for inverse maps. All the different maps with the same homogeneous part in their affine forms have inverses if and only if the homogeneous part does. Some of these maps are completely positive; others are not, but the homogeneous part is always completely positive. The conditions for an inverse are the same for maps that are not completely positive as for maps that are. For maps defined for fixed mean values, the homogeneous part depends only on the unitary operator for the dynamics of the larger system, not on any state or mean values or correlations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for an inverse are stated several different ways: in terms of the maps of matrices, basis matrices, density matrices, or mean values. The inverse maps are generally not tied to the dynamics the way the maps forward are. A trace-preserving completely positive map that is unital can not have an inverse that is obtained from any dynamics described by any unitary operator for any states of a larger system.

abstract: We use multipolar expansions to find the force on a gold coated sphere above a gold substrate; we study both an empty gold shell and a gold coated polystyrene sphere. We find four characteristic separation ranges. In the first region, which for the empty gold shell occurs for distances, d, smaller than the thickness of the coating, the result agrees with that on a solid gold sphere and varies as d^(-2); for larger separations there is a region where the force behaves as if the coating is strictly two dimensional and varies as d^(-5/2); in the third region the dependence is more unspecific; in the forth region when d is larger than the radius, the force varies as d^(-4). For homogeneous objects of more general shapes we introduce a numerical method based on the solution of an integral equation for the electric field over a system of objects with arbitrary shapes. We study the effect of shape and orientation on the van der Waals interaction between an object and a substrate and between two objects.

abstract: Recently, photon subtracted Gaussian states (PSGSs) were generated by several experimental groups. Those states were called "Schr\"odinger kittens" due to their similarities to superpositions of coherent states (SCSs) with small amplitudes. We compare the ideal SCSs and the PSGSs for experimental tests of certain types of Bell inequalities. In particular, we analyze the effects of the key experimental components used to generate PSGSs: mixedness of the Gaussian states, limited transmittivity of the beam splitter and the avalanche photodetector which cannot resolve photon numbers. As a result of this analysis, the degrees of mixedness and the beam splitter transmittivity that can be allowed for successful tests of Bell inequalities are revealed.

If the occurrence of erasures can be probed, then the decoder enables, in principle, a perfect recovery of the original light states. Otherwise, if supplemented with postselection based on homodyne detection, this code can be turned into an efficient erasure-filtration scheme. The experimental feasibility of the proposed protocol is carefully addressed.

abstract: For an invertible (bounded) linear operator Q acting in a Hilbert space ${\cal H}$, we consider the consequences of the QT-symmetry of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian $H:{\cal H}\to{\cal H}$ where T is the time-reversal operator. If H is symmetric in the sense that ${\cal T} H^\dagger {\cal T}=H$, then QT-symmetry is equivalent to Q^{-1}-weak-pseudo-Hermiticity. But in general this equivalence does not hold. We show this using some specific examples. Among these is a large class of non-PT-symmetric Hamiltonians that share the spectral properties of PT-symmetric Hamiltonians.

Specifically, we find that the free energy consists essentially of two terms, one leading term proportional to T^2, and a next term proportional to T^{5/2}. Both these terms give rise to zero Casimir entropy as T -> 0, thus in accordance with Nernst's theorem.

abstract: The Differential-Phase-Shift (DPS) and the Coherent-One-Way (COW) are among the most practical protocols for quantum cryptography, and are therefore the object of fast-paced experimental developments. The assessment of their security is also a challenge for theorists: the existing tools, that allow to prove security against the most general attacks, do not apply to these two protocols in any straightforward way. We present new upper bounds for their security in the limit of large distances ($d \gtrsim 50$km with typical values in optical fibers) by considering a large class of collective attacks, namely those in which the adversary attaches ancillary quantum systems to each pulse or to each pair of pulses. We introduce also two modified versions of the COW protocol, which may prove more robust than the original one.

abstract: We consider the EPR experiment in the energy-based stochastic reduction framework. A gedanken set up is constructed to model the interaction of the particles with the measurement devices. The evolution of particles' density matrix is analytically derived. We compute the dependence of the disentanglement rate on the parameters of the model, and study the dependence of the outcome probabilities on the noise trajectories. Finally, we argue that these trajectories can be regarded as non-local hidden variables.

abstract: We discuss the Casimir effect between two identical, parallel slabs, emphasizing the role of dissipation and temperature. Starting from quite general assumptions, we analyze the behavior of the Casimir entropy in the limit T->0 and link it to the behavior of the slab's reflection coefficients at low frequencies. We also derive a formula in terms of a sum over modes, valid for dissipative slabs that can be interpreted in terms of a damped quantum oscillator.

abstract: We report on our research effort to generate large-scale multipartite optical-mode entanglement using as few physical resources as possible. We have previously shown that cluster- and GHZ-type N-partite continuous-variable entanglement can be obtained in an optical resonator that contains a suitably designed second-order nonlinear optical medium, pumped by at most O(N^2) fields. In this paper, we show that the frequency comb of such a resonator can be entangled into an arbitrary number of independent 2x2 and 2x3 continuous-variable cluster states by a single optical parametric oscillator pumped by just a few optical modes.

abstract: We propose a method that enables efficient storage and retrieval of a photonic excitation stored in an ensemble quantum memory consisting of Lambda-type absorbers with non-zero Stokes shift. We show that this can be used to implement a multimode quantum memory storing multiple frequency-encoded qubits in a single ensemble, and allowing their selective retrieval. The read-out scheme applies to memory setups based on both electromagnetically-induced transparency and stimulated Raman scattering, and spatially separates the output signal field from the control fields.

For the case of mixed states, these generalized observables can be used to find valid lower bounds on entanglement monotones that can be measured in laboratory experiments in the same fashion as it can also be done for pure states.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5039
abstract: We present an elementary and explicit proof of the separability criterion for continuous variable two-party Gaussian systems. Our proof is based on an elementary formulation of uncertainty relations and an explicit determination of squeezing parameters for which the P-representation condition saturates the $Sp(2,R)\otimes Sp(2,R)$ invariant separability condition. We thus give the explicit formulas of squeezing parameters, which establish the equivalence of the separability condition with the P-representation condition, in terms of the parameters of the standard form of the correlation matrix. Our proof is compared to the past proofs, and it is pointed out that the original proof of the P-representation by Duan, Giedke, Cirac and Zoller(DGCZ) is incomplete. A way to complete their proof is then shown. It is noted that both of the corrected proof of DGCZ and the proof of R. Simon are closely related to our explicit construction despite their quite different appearances.

abstract: We use variable transformation from the real line to finite or semi-infinite spaces where we expand the regular solution of the 1D time-independent Schrodinger equation in terms of square integrable bases. We also require that the basis support an infinite tridiagonal matrix representation of the wave operator. By this requirement, we deduce a class of solvable potentials along with their corresponding bound states and stationary wavefunctions expressed as infinite series in terms of these bases. This approach allows for simultaneous treatment of the discrete (bound states) as well as the continuous (scattering states) spectrum on the same footing. The problem translates into finding solutions of the resulting three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the wavefunction. These are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials, some of which are modified versions of known polynomials. The examples given, which are not exhaustive, illustrate the power of this approach in dealing with 1D quantum problems.

abstract: Doppler laser cooling of a three-level ladder system using two near-resonant laser fields is analyzed in the case of the intermediate level being metastable while the upper level is short-lived. Analytical as well as numerical results for e.g. obtainable scattering rates and achievable temperatures are presented. When appropriate, comparisons with two-level single photon Doppler laser cooling is made. These results are relevant to recent experimental Doppler laser cooling investigations addressing intercombination lines in alkali-earth metal atoms and quadrupole transitions in alkali-earth metal ions.

abstract: We investigated the orbital magnetic moment of electron in the hydrogen atom in deformed space with minimal length. It turned out that corrections to the magnetic moment caused by deformation depend on one parameter in the presence of two-parametric deformation. It is interesting to note that the correction to orbital magnetic moment is similar to the correction that follows from relativistic theory but it has an opposite sign. Using the upper bound for minimal length obtained in previous papers we estimated the upper bound for relative correction to orbital magnetic moment and obtained the value $\sim 10^{-12}$. This is four power less than the relative error for most recent experimental values of Bohr magneton.

abstract: We develop an exact method for computing the Casimir energy between arbitrary compact objects, both with boundary conditions for a scalar field and dielectrics or perfect conductors for the electromagnetic field. The energy is obtained as an interaction between multipoles, generated by quantum source or current fluctuations. The objects' shape and composition enter only through their scattering matrices. The result is exact when all multipoles are included, and converges rapidly. A low frequency expansion yields the energy as a series in the ratio of the objects' size to their separation. As examples, we obtain this series for two spheres with Robin boundary conditions for a scalar field and dielectric spheres for the electromagnetic field. The full interaction at all separations is obtained for spheres with Robin boundary conditions and for perfectly conducting spheres.

title: Weak measurement takes a simple form for cumulants
authors: Graeme Mitchison

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5113
abstract: A weak measurement on a system is made by coupling a pointer weakly to the system and then measuring the position of the pointer. If the initial wavefunction for the pointer is real, the mean displacement of the pointer is proportional to the so-called weak value of the observable being measured. This gives an intuitively direct way of understanding weak measurement. However, if the initial pointer wavefunction takes complex values, the relationship between pointer displacement and weak value is not quite so simple, as pointed out recently by R. Jozsa. This is even more striking in the case of sequential weak measurements. These are carried out by coupling several pointers at different stages of evolution of the system, and the relationship between the products of the measured pointer positions and the sequential weak values can become extremely complicated for an arbitrary initial pointer wavefunction. Surprisingly, all this complication vanishes when one calculates the cumulants of pointer positions. These are directly proportional to the cumulants of sequential weak values. This suggests that cumulants have a fundamental physical significance for weak measurement.

abstract: The title of this article is misleading. The authors have investigated a resonator but not a tunneling barrier see also Refs.\cite{Winful2} The measured superluminal group velocity and discussed is that studied on a Lorentz-Lorenz oscillator by Sommerfeld and Brillouin a hundred years ago \cite{Brillouin}. It is similar to the faster than light experiment by Wang et al. based also on anomalous dispersion with a complex refractive index of a resonator \cite{Wang}. Tunneling, however, is understood and performed by electromagnetic evanescent modes or by tunneling solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation, which have purely imaginary wave numbers. The latter includes a purely imaginary refractive index. Signals with purely evanescent frequency components can travel at a superluminal velocity \cite{NimtzH,Nimtz1}. Inside the barrier tunneling proceeds even instantaneously, i.e.by a process described by virtual photons \cite{Stahlhofen}.

abstract: Trapped ions arranged in Coulomb crystals provide us with the elements to study the physics of a single spin coupled to a boson bath. In this work we show that optical forces allow us to realize a variety of spin-boson models, depending on the crystal geometry and the laser configuration. We study in detail the Ohmic case, which can be implemented by illuminating a single ion with a travelling wave. The mesoscopic character of the phonon bath in trapped ions induces new effects like the appearance of quantum revivals in the spin evolution.

In particular the most general notion of quantum predicate as positive operator valued measure (POVM) is introduced. The previously known quantum weakest precondition result has been extended to cover the case of POVM playing the role of a quantum predicate. Additionally, our result is valid in infinite dimension case and also holds for a quantum programs defined as a positive but not necessary completely positive transformations of a quantum states.

abstract: We derive the lateral Casimir-Polder force on a ground state atom on top of a corrugated surface, up to first order in the corrugation amplitude. Our calculation is based on the scattering approach, which takes into account nonspecular reflections and polarization mixing for electromagnetic quantum fluctuations impinging on real materials. We compare our first order exact result with two commonly used approximation methods. We show that the proximity force approximation (large corrugation wavelengths) overestimates the lateral force, while the pairwise summation approach underestimates it due to the non-additivity of dispersion forces. We argue that a frequency shift measurement for the dipolar lateral oscillations of cold atoms could provide a striking demonstration of nontrivial geometrical effects on the quantum vacuum.

abstract: New solid-state physics based approach is developed for analysis of the paraxial light propagation in two-dimensional (2D) photonic lattices of coupled dielectric waveguides or microcavities. In particular, using Maxwell's equations, a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian eigenproblem with respect to the spinor wave function of a photon is obtained for energy-dissipating photonic microstructures. The Hamiltonian is suitable for almost the entire subclass of 2D structures encompassing arrays of semiconductor microcavities and microstructured photonic crystal fibers, characterized by light propagating mostly normal to the periodic lattice plane. Methods of numerical solution are discussed and the formalism is applied to a square array of coupled semiconductor microcavities, revealing reach possibilities for tailoring photonic band structure both in the photon energy and photon lifetime energy broadening domains. In particular, a feasibility to open a double photonic crystal band gap simultaneously in the energy and lifetime energy broadening domains is demonstrated.

abstract: We explore the subtle relationships between partial separability and entanglement of subsystems in multiqubit quantum states and give experimentally accessible conditions that distinguish between various classes and levels of partial separability in a hierarchical order. These conditions take the form of bounds on the correlations of locally orthogonal observables. Violations of such inequalities give strong sufficient criteria for various forms of partial inseparability and multiqubit entanglement. The strength of these criteria is illustrated by showing that they are stronger than several other well-known entanglement criteria (the fidelity criterion, violation of Mermin-type separability inequalities, the Laskowski-\.Zukowski criterion and the D\"ur-Cirac criterion), and also by showing their great noise robustness for a variety of multiqubit states, including N-qubit GHZ states and Dicke states. Furthermore, for N greater than or equal to 3 they can detect bound entangled states. For all these states, the required number of measurement settings for implementation of the entanglement criteria is shown to be only N+1. If one chooses the familiar Pauli matrices as single-qubit observables, the inequalities take the form of bounds on the anti-diagonal matrix elements of a state in terms of its diagonal matrix elements.

It is shown that an approximate diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian in the second quantized formulation gives rise to a reliable and unambiguous criterion of the adiabatic approximation. This is illustrated for the model of Marzlin and Sanders and a model related to the geometric phase which can be exactly diagonalized in the present sense.

abstract: In this paper we classify the four-qubit states that commute with $U\otimes{U}\otimes{V}\otimes{V}$, where $U$ and $V$ are arbitrary members of the Pauli group. We characterize the set of separable states for this class, in terms of a finite number of entanglement witnesses. Equivalently, we characterize the two-qubit, Bell-diagonal-preserving, completely positive maps that are separable. These separable completely positive maps correspond to protocols that can be implemented with stochastic local operations assisted by classical communication (SLOCC). This allows us to derive a complete set of SLOCC monotones for Bell-diagonal states, which, in turn, provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for converting one two-qubit state to another by SLOCC.

abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have distinct promise as solid-state qubits. This is because of their large dipole moment, convenient level structure and very long room-temperature coherence times. In general, a combination of ion irradiation and subsequent annealing is used to create the centers, however for the rigorous demands of quantum computing all processes need to be optimized, and decoherence due to the residual damage caused by the implantation process itself must be mitigated. To that end we have studied photoluminescence (PL) from NV$^-$, NV$^0$ and GR1 centers formed by ion implantation of 2MeV He ions over a wide range of fluences. The sample was annealed at $600^{\circ}$C to minimize residual vacancy diffusion, allowing for the concurrent analysis of PL from NV centers and irradiation induced vacancies (GR1). We find non-monotic PL intensities with increasing ion fluence, monotonic increasing PL in NV$^0$/NV$^-$ and GR1/(NV$^0$ + NV$^1$) ratios, and increasing inhomogeneous broadening of the zero-phonon lines with increasing ion fluence. All these results shed important light on the optimal formation conditions for NV qubits. We apply our findings to an off-resonant photonic quantum memory scheme using vibronic sidebands.

abstract: No consensus seems to exist as to what constitutes a measurement which is still considered somewhat mysterious in many respects in quantum mechanics. At successive stages mathematical theory of measure, metrology and measurement theory tried to systematize this field but significant questions remain open about the nature of measurement, about the characterization of the observer, about the reliability of measurement processes etc. The present paper attempts to talk about these questions through the information science. We start from the idea, rather common and intuitive, that the measurement process basically acquires information. Next we expand this idea through four formal definitions and infer some corollaries regarding the measurement process from those definitions. Relativity emerges as the basic property of measurement from the present logical framework and this rather surprising result collides with the feeling of physicists who take measurement as a myth. In the closing this paper shows how the measurement relativity wholly consists with some effects calculated in QM and in Einstein's theory.

abstract: We demonstrate pulsed operation of a bidirectionally pumped polarization Sagnac interferometric down-conversion source and its generation of narrowband, high-visibility polarization-entangled photons. Driven by a narrowband, mode-locked pump at 390.35 nm, the phase-stable Sagnac source with a type-II phase-matched periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ crystal is capable of producing 0.01 entangled pair per pulse in a 0.15-nm bandwidth centered at 780.7 nm with 1 mW of average pump power at a repetition rate of 31.1 MHz. We have achieved a mean photon-pair generation rate of as high as 0.7 pair per pulse, at which multi-pair events dominate and significantly reduce the two-photon quantum-interference visibility. For low generation probability $\alpha$, the reduced visibility $V=1-\alpha$ is independent of the throughput efficiency and of the polarization analysis basis, which can be utilized to yield an accurate estimate of the generation rate $\alpha$. At low $\alpha$ we have characterized the source entanglement quality in three different ways: average quantum-interference visibility of 99%, the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt $S$ parameter of $2.739 \pm 0.119$, and quantum state tomography with 98.85% singlet-state fidelity. The narrowband pulsed Sagnac source of entangled photons is suitable for use in quantum information processing applications such as free-space quantum key distribution.

abstract: We analytically investigate the ground-state properties of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with few &#8312;&#8311;Rb atoms inside a high-quality cavity quantum electrodynamics. In the SU(2) representation for atom, this quantum system can be realized a generalized Dicke model with a quadratic term arising from the interatomic interactions, which can be controlled experimentally by Feshbach resonance technique. Moreover, this weak interspecies interaction can give rise to an important zero-temperature quantum phase transition from the normal to the superradiant phases, where the atomic ensemble in the normal phase is collectively unexcited while is macroscopically excited with coherent radiations in the superradiant phase. Finally, we propose to observe this predicted quantum phase transition by measuring the direct and striking signatures of the photon field in terms of a heterodyne detector out of the cavity.

abstract: We study the effect of defects in the Mott insulator phase of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice on the dynamics of resonant excitations. Defects, which can either be empty sites in a Mott insulator state with one atom per site or a singly occupied site for a filling factor two, change the dynamics of Frenkel excitons and cavity polaritons. While the vacancies in first case behave like hard sphere scatters for excitons, singly occupied sites in the latter case can lead to attractive or repulsive scattering potentials. We suggest cavity polaritons as observation tool of such defects, and show how the scattering can be controlled in changing the exciton-photon detuning. In the case of asymmetric optical lattice sites we present how the scattering effective potential can be detuned by the cavity photon polarization direction, with the possibility of a crossover from a repulsive into an attractive potential.

abstract: We review the relation between Casimir effect and geometry, emphasizing deviations from the commonly used Proximity Force Approximation (PFA). We use to this aim the scattering formalism which is nowadays the best tool available for accurate and reliable theory-experiment comparisons. We first recall the main lines of this formalism when the mirrors can be considered to obey specular reflection. We then discuss the more general case where non planar mirrors give rise to non-specular reflection with wavevectors and field polarisations mixed. The general formalism has already been fruitfully used for evaluating the effect of roughness on the Casimir force as well as the lateral Casimir force or Casimir torque appearing between corrugated surfaces. In this short review, we focus our attention on the case of the lateral force which should make possible in the future an experimental demonstration of the nontrivial (i.e. beyond PFA) interplay of geometry and Casimir effect.

abstract: We reconsider the non-Markovian time-continuous measurement of a Heisenberg observable x and show for the first time that it can be realized by an infinite set of entangled von Neumann detectors. The concept of continuous read-out is introduced and used to re-derive the non-Markovian stochastic Schrodinger equation. We can prove that, contrary to recent doubts, the resulting non-Markovian quantum trajectories are true single system trajectories and correspond to the continuous measurement of a retarded functional of x. However, the generic non-Markovian trajectories are mixed state trajectories. This version merges an Erratum [PRL, in print] with my Letter [PRL 100, 080401 (2008)], some corrections follow directly from the recent criticism by Wiseman and Gambetta, further corrections restore the validity of my Letter. Contrary to my suggestion there, the given continuous measurement schemes cannot yield pure state trajectories but mixed-state ones. Yet, it is possible to retain my claim that the non-Markovian stochastic Schrodinger equation describes true time-continuous measurement - with delay and retrodiction.

abstract: We propose a class of schemes for robust population transfer between quantum states that utilize trains of coherent pulses and represent a generalized adiabatic passage via a wave packet. We study piecewise Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage with pulse-to-pulse amplitude variation, and piecewise chirped Raman passage with pulse-to-pulse phase variation, implemented with an optical frequency comb. In the context of production of ultracold ground-state molecules, we show that with almost no knowledge of the excited potential, robust high-efficiency transfer is possible

In the Letter the familiar uncertainty relation follows from the following stronger statement: Of all parallelograms with given sides the rectangle has the largest area.

title: Negativity and contextuality are equivalent notions of nonclassicality

abstract: Two notions of nonclassicality that have been investigated intensively are: (i) negativity, that is, the need to posit negative values when representing quantum states by quasiprobability distributions such as the Wigner representation, and (ii) contextuality, that is, the impossibility of a noncontextual hidden variable model of quantum theory (also known as the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem). Although both of these notions were meant to characterize the conditions under which a classical explanation cannot be provided, we demonstrate that they prove inadequate to the task and we argue for a particular way of generalizing and revising them. With the refined version of each in hand, it becomes apparent that they are in fact one and the same. We also demonstrate the impossibility of noncontextuality or nonnegativity in quantum theory with a novel proof that is symmetric in its treatment of measurements and preparations.

abstract: Quantum algorithms can be analyzed in a query model to compute Boolean functions where input is given in a black box and the aim is to compute function value for arbitrary input using as few queries as possible. We concentrate on quantum query algorithm designing tasks in this paper. The main aim of the research was to find new efficient algorithms and develop general algorithm designing techniques. First, we present several exact quantum query algorithms for certain problems that are better than classical counterparts. Next, we introduce algorithm transformation methods that allow significant enlarging of exactly computable functions sets. Finally, we propose quantum algorithm designing methods. Given algorithms for the set of sub-functions, our methods use them to design a more complex one, based on algorithms described before. Methods are applicable for input algorithms with specific properties and preserve acceptable error probability and number of queries. Methods offer constructions for computing AND, OR and MAJORITY kinds of Boolean functions.

abstract: The metric associated with a quasi-Hermitian Hamiltonian and its physical implications are scrutinised. Consequences of the non-uniqueness such as the question of the probability interpretation and the possible and forbidden choices of additional observables are investigated and exemplified by specific illustrative examples. In particular it is argued that the improper identification of observables lies at the origin of the claimed violation of the brachistchrone transition time between orthogonal states. The need for further physical input to remove ambiguities is pointed out.

abstract: When a stationary reflecting wall acting as a perfect mirror for an atomic beam with well defined incident velocity is suddenly removed, the density profile develops during the time evolution an oscillatory pattern known as diffraction in time. The interference fringes are suppressed or their visibility is diminished by several effects such as averaging over a distribution of incident velocities, apodization of the aperture function, atom-atom interactions, imperfect reflection or environmental noise. However, when the mirror moves with finite velocity along the direction of propagation of the beam, the visibility of the fringes is enhanced. For mirror velocities below beam velocity, as used for slowing down the beam, the matter wave splits into three regions separated by space-time points with classical analogues. For mirror velocities above beam velocity a visibility enhancement occurs without a classical counterpart. When the velocity of the beam approaches that of the mirror the density oscillations rise by a factor 1.8 over the stationary value.

abstract: Rydberg atoms provide a wide range of possibilities to tailor interactions in a quantum gas. Here we report on Rydberg excitation of Bose-Einstein condensed 87Rb atoms. The Rydberg fraction was investigated for various excitation times and temperatures above and below the condensation temperature. The excitation is locally blocked by the van der Waals interaction between Rydberg atoms to a density-dependent limit. Therefore the abrupt change of the thermal atomic density distribution to the characteristic bimodal distribution upon condensation could be observed in the Rydberg fraction. The observed features are reproduced by a simulation based on local collective Rydberg excitations.

abstract: Multiport generalizations of beam splitters are the key component in multipath interferometers, which are important in a range of quantum state engineering and precision measurement schemes. Here we propose a straightforward method for implementing multiport devices for atoms trapped in optical ring lattices. These devices are interesting as atoms have certain properties (such as mass) that photons do not and the ring configuration makes them useful for applications such as precision gyroscopes. We discuss how they could be employed in useful measurement schemes and investigate how practical considerations limit the size of the devices that can be achieved by this method.

abstract: Determining the ultimate classical information carrying capacity of electromagnetic waves requires quantum-mechanical analysis to properly account for the bosonic nature of these waves. Recent work has established capacity theorems for bosonic single-user, broadcast, and wiretap channels, under the presumption of two minimum output entropy conjectures. Despite considerable accumulated evidence that supports the validity of these conjectures, they have yet to be proven. Here we show that the preceding minimum output entropy conjectures are simple consequences of an Entropy Photon-Number Inequality, which is a conjectured quantum-mechanical analog of the Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) from classical information theory.

abstract: We consider two parallel corrugated plates and show that a Casimir torque arises when the corrugation directions are not aligned. We follow the scattering approach and calculate the Casimir energy up to second order in the corrugation amplitudes, taking into account nonspecular reflections, polarization mixing and the finite conductivity of the metals. We compare our results with the proximity force approximation, which overestimates the torque by a factor 2 when taking the conditions that optimize the effect. We argue that the Casimir torque could be measured for separation distances as large as 1 $\mu{\rm m}.$

abstract: We use the matrix product formalism to find exact ground states of two new spin-1 quantum chains with nearest neighbor interactions. One of the models, model I, describes a one-parameter family of quantum chains for which the ground state can be found exactly. In certain limit of the parameter, the Hamiltonian turns into the interesting case $H=\sum_i ({\bf S}_i\cdot {\bf S}_{i+1})^2$. The other model which we label as model II, corresponds to a family of solvable three-state vertex models on square two dimensional lattices. The ground state of this model is highly degenerate and the matrix product states is a generating state of such degenerate states. The simple structure of the matrix product state allows us to determine the properties of degenerate states which are otherwise difficult to determine. For both models we find exact expressions for correlation functions.

abstract: This article provides a convenient framework for quantitative evaluation of the entanglement generated when two structureless, distinguishable particles scatter non-relativistically in one dimension. It explores how three factors determine the amount of entanglement generated: the momentum distributions of the incoming particles, their masses, and the interaction potential. Two important scales emerge, one set by the kinematics and one set by the dynamics. This method also provides two approximate analytic formulas useful for numerical evaluation of entanglement and reveals an interesting connection between purity, linear coordinate transformations, and momentum uncertainties.

abstract: Geometrical phases have been applied in virtually every major branch of physics and they play an important role in topology and knot theory in mathematics and quantum computation. However, most of the early works focus on pure quantum states which are very unrealistic and almost never occur in practice. The two existed definitions -Uhlmann's and Sj\"{o}qvist's- would result in different values for the geometric phase in general. The definition of geometric phase in mixed state scenario is still an open question. Here we present a unified framework for both approaches within one and the same formalism based on simple interferometry. We then present experimental results which confirm both approaches to mixed state geometric phase and clearly demonstrate that their unification is possible. Our experiments are furthermore the first such to measure Uhlmann's mixed state geometric phase and show in addition that it is different to the Sj\"{o}qvist's phase.

abstract: Reliable preparation of entanglement between distant systems is an outstanding problem in quantum information science and quantum communication. In practice, this has to be accomplished via noisy channels (such as optical fibers) that generally result in exponential attenuation of quantum signals at large distances. A special class of quantum error correction protocols--quantum repeater protocols--can be used to overcome such losses. In this work, we introduce a method for systematically optimizing existing protocols and developing new, more efficient protocols. Our approach makes use of a dynamic programming-based searching algorithm, the complexity of which scales only polynomially with the communication distance, letting us efficiently determine near-optimal solutions. We find significant improvements in both the speed and the final state fidelity for preparing long distance entangled states.

abstract: In the present paper, we study the continuous-time quantum walk on quotient graphs. On such graphs, there is a straightforward reduction of problem to a subspace that can be considerably smaller than the original one. Along the lines of reductions, by using the idea of calculation of the probability amplitudes for continuous-time quantum walk in terms of the spectral distribution associated with the adjacency matrix of graphs [Jafarizadeh and Salimi (Ann. Phys 322(2007))], we show the continuous-time quantum walk on original graph $\Gamma$ induces a continuous-time quantum walk on quotient graph $\Gamma_H$. Finally, for example we investigate continuous-time quantum walk on some quotient Cayley graphs.

abstract: We consider the manipulation of multipartite entangled states in the limit of many copies under quantum operations that asymptotically cannot generate entanglement. As announced in [Brandao and Plenio, Nature Physics 4, 8 (2008)], and in stark contrast to the manipulation of entanglement under local operations and classical communication, the entanglement shared by two or more parties can be reversibly interconverted in this setting. The unique entanglement measure is identified as the regularized relative entropy of entanglement, which is shown to be equal to a regularized and smoothed version of the logarithmic robustness of entanglement. Here we give a rigorous proof of this result, which is fundamentally based on a certain recent extension of quantum Stein's Lemma proved in [Brandao and Plenio, Commun. Math. 295, 791 (2010)], giving the best measurement strategy for discriminating several copies of an entangled state from an arbitrary sequence of non-entangled states, with an optimal distinguishability rate equal to the regularized relative entropy of entanglement. We moreover analyse the connection of our approach to axiomatic formulations of the second law of thermodynamics.

We have shown how the entanglement or concurrence evolve as the size of the system being large, i.e. the finite size scaling is obtained. Moreover, It introduces how the renormalization group approach can be implemented to obtain the quantum information properties of a many body system. We have obtained the concurrence as a measure of entanglement, its derivatives and their scaling behavior versus the size of system for the one dimensional Ising model in transverse field. We have found that the derivative of concurrence between two blocks each containing half of the system size diverges at the critical point with the exponent which is directly associated with the divergence of the correlation length.

abstract: We discuss aspects of the convex-roof extension of multipartite entanglement measures, that is, $SL(2,\CC)$ invariant tangles. We highlight two key concepts that contain valuable information about the tangle of a density matrix: the {\em zero-polytope} is a convex set of density matrices with vanishing tangle whereas the {\em convex characteristic curve} readily provides a non-trivial lower bound for the convex roof and serves as a tool for constructing the convex roof outside the zero-polytope. Both concepts are derived from the tangle for superpositions of the eigenstates of the density matrix. We illustrate their application by considering examples of density matrices for two-qubit and three-qubit states of rank 2, thereby pointing out both the power and the limitations of the concepts.

abstract: The dissipative dynamics of Gaussian squeezed states (GSS) and coherent superposition states (CSS) are analytically obtained and compared. Time scales for sustaining different quantum properties such as squeezing, negativity of the Wigner function or photon number distribution are calculated. Some of these characteristic times also depend on initial conditions. For example, in the particular case of squeezing, we find that while the squeezing of CSS is only visible for small enough values of the field intensity, in GSS it is independent of this quantity, which may be experimentally advantageous. The asymptotic dynamics however is quite similar as revealed by the time evolution of the fidelity between states of the two classes.

Thus, we prove the separation between quantum capacities assisted by backward classical communication and two-way classical communication.

abstract: The concept of probability was prominent in the original foundations of quantum mechanics, and continues to be so today. Indeed, the controversies regarding objective and subjective interpretations of probability have again become active. I argue that, although both objective and subjective probabilities have domains of relevance in QM, their roles are quite distinct. Even where both are legitimate, the objective and subjective probabilities differ, both conceptually and numerically. There are quantum probabilities that have no useful subjective interpretations, and there are subjective probabilities that cannot be realized as quantum probabilities.

To elucidate the method, we study a simple model inspired by mesoscopic physics --an asymmetric junction. The system is governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which captures essential aspects of irreversibility.

An extensive set of quantum measures is utilized in our analysis, including von Neumann and generalized quantum entropies, quantum depletion, and the pair correlation function. We find that quantum effects cause the soliton to fill in. Moreover, soliton-soliton collisions become inelastic, in strong contrast to the predictions of mean-field theory. These features show that the lifetime and collision properties of dark solitons in optical lattices provide clear signals of quantum effects.

The flux qubit is cooled by manipulating its states, following an inverse process of state population inversion, and then the qubit is switched on to resonantly interact with the neighboring quantum system. By repeating these steps, the two subsystems can be simultaneously cooled. Our results show that this cooling is robust and effective, irrespective of the chosen quantum systems connected to the qubit.

Possible extensions of the N = 2 supersymmetry are briefly discussed.

abstract: State of the art nanomechanical resonators present quality factors Q ~ 10^3 - 10^5, which are much lower than those that can be naively extrapolated from the behavior of micromechanical resonators. We analyze the dissipation mechanism that arises in nanomechanical beam-structures due to the tunneling of mesoscopic phonons between the beam and its supports (known as clamping losses). We derive the environmental force spectral density that determines the quantum Brownian motion of a given resonance. Our treatment is valid for low frequencies and provides the leading contribution in the aspect ratio. This yields fundamental limits for the Q-values which are described by simple scaling laws and are relevant for state of the art experimental structures. In this context, for resonant frequencies in the 0.1-1GHz range, while this dissipation mechanism can limit flexural resonators it is found to be negligible for torsional ones. In the case of structureless 3D supports the corresponding environmental spectral densities are Ohmic for flexural resonators and super-Ohmic for torsional ones, while for 2D slab supports they yield 1/f noise. Furthermore analogous results are established for the case of suspended semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes. Finally, we provide a general expression for the spectral density that allows to extend our treatment to other geometries and illustrate its use by applying it to a microtoroid. Our analysis is relevant for applications in high precision measurements and for the prospects of probing quantum effects in a macroscopic mechanical degree of freedom.

abstract: Low energy elastic scattering between clouds of Bose condensed atoms leads to the well known s-wave halo with atoms emerging in all directions from the collision zone. In this paper we discuss the emergence of Hanbury Brown and Twiss coincidences between atoms scattered in nearly parallel directions. We develop a simple model that explains the observations in terms of an interference involving two pairs of atoms each associated with the elementary s wave scattering process.

abstract: This paper seeks to expand the scope of the alkaline seepage site hydrothermal mound scenario of Russell et al, by appealing to its wider canvas for hypothesizing self-assembly of gregite clusters via interplay of forces within the gel phase of FeS membranes: directed heat transport a la Rayleigh-Benard convection for dissociation, vs oriented attachment (small clusters) and magnetic forces (large clusters) for association, the latter assisted by magnetic mound constituents. The directed movement of tiny clusters through cluster layers are reminiscent of processes like budding, molecular motors, pre-RNA world on the lines of Cairns-Smith's hypothesis, and optical polarity. Higher rate of (soft) multinucleate formation vs growth rate of (rigid) microcrystals, correlates with icosahedral (forbidden crystallographically!) framboidal morphology. This pattern indicates a link to phylotaxis, thus reinforcing the quasi-periodicity connection which can provide a natural access to features like surface limit, anomalous transport and low thermal conductivity, while facilitating diffusion through clusters. And magnetism offers a hierarchy of features: primordial multicellularity; phase correlations of assembled molecules; overcoming thermal decoherence. These dynamical nested structures offer possibilities for iterative computations, adaptive learning, and coherent quantum searches. The link between enzymatic FeS clusters and the Hadean ocean floor is seen as part of a larger conceptual framework uncovering a role for Magnetism and the Origin of Life.

We explore all the possible signs of the potentials and discuss their bound-state solutions for fermions and antifermions. The cases of mixed vector and scalar P\"{o}schl-Teller-like and pseudoscalar kink-like potentials, already analyzed in previous works, are obtained as particular cases.

abstract: At half filling, the electronic structure of graphene can be modelled by a pair of free two-dimensional Dirac fermions. We explicitly demonstrate that in the presence of a geometrically induced gauge field, an everywhere-real Kekule modulation of the hopping matrix elements can correspond to a non-real Higgs field with non-trivial vorticity. This provides a natural setting for fractionally charged vortices with localized zero modes. For fullerene-like molecules we employ the index theorem to demonstrate the existence of six low-lying states that do not depend strongly on the Kekule-induced mass gap.

abstract: Exact analytic solutions are found for the Dirac equation in 2+1 dimensions for a spin-one-half particle in a combination of the Lorentz 3-vector and scalar Coulomb as well as Aharonov--Bohm potentials. We employ the two-component Dirac equation which contains a new parameter introduced by Hagen to describe the spin of the spin-1/2 particle. We derive a transcendental equations that implicitly determine the energy spectrum of an electron near the negative-energy continuum boundary and the critical charges for some electron states. Fermion pair production from a vacuum by a strong Coulomb field in the presence of the magnetic flux tube of zero radius is considered. It is shown that the presence of the Ahanorov--Bohm flux tends to stabilize the system.

abstract: We present a general, model-independent, quantum statistical treatment of the connection between the quantum and hydrodynamical pictures of reservoir driven macroscopic systems. This treatment is centred on the large scale properties of locally conserved hydrodynamical observables and is designed to form a bridge between quantum microdynamics and classical macroscopic continuum mechanics, rather than a derivation of the latter from the former. The key assumptions on which the treatment is based are hypotheses of chaoticity and local equilibrium for the hydrodynamical fluctuations around nonequilibrium steady states, together with an extension of Onsager's regrssion hypothesis to those states. On this basis, we establish canonical generalisations of both the Onsager reciprocity relations and the Onsager-Machlup fluctuation theory to nonequilibrium steady states, and we show that the spatial correlations of the hydrodynamical fluctuations are generically of long range in these states.

abstract: The probabilistic character of the measurement process is one of the most puzzling and fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics. In many-body systems quantum mechanical noise reveals non-local correlations of the underlying many-body states. Here, we provide a complete experimental analysis of the shot-to-shot variations of interference fringe contrast for pairs of independently created one-dimensional Bose condensates. Analyzing different system sizes we observe the crossover from thermal to quantum noise, reflected in a characteristic change in the distribution functions from Poissonian to Gumbel-type, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions based on the Luttinger liquid formalism. We present the first experimental observation of quasi long-range order in one-dimensional atomic condensates, which is a hallmark of quantum fluctuations in one-dimensional systems. Furthermore, our experiments constitute the first analysis of the full distribution of quantum noise in an interacting many-body system.

abstract: We propose a new method of creating solitons in elongated Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) by sweeping three laser beams through the BEC. If one of the beams is in the first order (TEM10) Hermite-Gaussian mode, its amplitude has a transversal phase slip which can be transferred to the atoms creating a soliton. Using this method it is possible to circumvent the restriction set by the diffraction limit inherent to conventional methods such as phase imprinting. The method allows one to create multicomponent (vector) solitons of the dark-bright form as well as the dark-dark combination. In addition it is possible to create in a controllable way two or more dark solitons with very small velocity and close to each other for studying their collisional properties.

abstract: A chain of singly-charged particles, confined by a harmonic potential, exhibits a sudden transition to a zigzag configuration when the radial potential reaches a critical value, depending on the particle number. This structural change is a phase transition of second order, whose order parameter is the crystal displacement from the chain axis. We study analytically the transition using Landau theory and find full agreement with numerical predictions by [J. Schiffer Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 818 (1993)] and [Piacente et al Phys. Rev. B 69, 045324 (2004)]. Our theory allows us to determine analytically the system's behaviour at the transition point.

abstract: We study numerically the behavior of qubit coupled to a quantum dissipative driven oscillator (resonator). Above a critical coupling strength the qubit rotations become synchronized with the oscillator phase. In the synchronized regime, at certain parameters, the qubit exhibits tunneling between two orientations with a macroscopic change of number of photons in the resonator. The life times in these metastable states can be enormously large. The synchronization leads to a drastic change of qubit radiation spectrum with appearance of narrow lines corresponding to recently observed single artificial-atom lasing [O. Astafiev {\it et al.} Nature {\bf 449}, 588 (2007)].

abstract: We observe large density modulations in time-of-flight images of elongated Bose-Einstein condensates, initially confined in a harmonic trap and in the presence of weak disorder. The development of these modulations during the time-of-flight and their dependence with the disorder are investigated. We render an account of this effect using numerical and analytical calculations. We conclude that the observed large density modulations originate from the weak initial density modulations induced by the disorder, and not from initial phase fluctuations (thermal or quantum).

abstract: We investigate entanglement of strongly interacting fermions in spatially inhomogeneous environments. To quantify entanglement in the presence of spatial inhomogeneity, we propose a local-density approximation (LDA) to the entanglement entropy, and a nested LDA scheme to evaluate the entanglement entropy on inhomogeneous density profiles. These ideas are applied to models of electrons in superlattice structures with different modulation patterns, electrons in a metallic wire in the presence of impurities, and phase-separated states in harmonically confined many-fermion systems, such as electrons in quantum dots and atoms in optical traps. We find that the entanglement entropy of inhomogeneous systems is strikingly different from that of homogeneous systems.

Now the q-oscillator stands on the equal footing to the ordinary harmonic oscillator.

Along the way to characterise the system, connections with classical statistical mechanics and integrable models are explored. Finally, the relevance of the model in the physics of low dimensional anti-ferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators is discussed.

abstract: A harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian augmented by a non-Hermitian \pt-symmetric part and its su(1,1) generalizations, for which a family of positive-definite metric operators was recently constructed, are re-examined in a supersymmetric context. Quasi-Hermitian supersymmetric extensions of such Hamiltonians are proposed by enlarging su(1,1) to a ${\rm su}(1,1/1) \sim {\rm osp}(2/2, \R)$ superalgebra. This allows the construction of new non-Hermitian Hamiltonians related by similarity to Hermitian ones. Some examples of them are reviewed.

abstract: Holographic reduced representations (HRR) are based on superpositions of convolution-bound $n$-tuples, but the $n$-tuples cannot be regarded as vectors since the formalism is basis dependent. This is why HRR cannot be associated with geometric structures. Replacing convolutions by geometric products one arrives at reduced representations analogous to HRR but interpretable in terms of geometry. Variable bindings occurring in both HRR and its geometric analogue mathematically correspond to two different representations of $Z_2\times...\times Z_2$ (the additive group of binary $n$-tuples with addition modulo 2). As opposed to standard HRR, variable binding performed by means of geometric product allows for computing exact inverses of all nonzero vectors, a procedure even simpler than approximate inverses employed in HRR. The formal structure of the new reduced representation is analogous to cartoon computation, a geometric analogue of quantum computation.

abstract: We investigate a paradigm example of cavity quantum electrodynamics with many body systems: an ultracold atomic gas inside a pumped optical resonator. In particular, we study the stability of atomic insulator-like states, confined by the mechanical potential emerging from the cavity field spatial mode structure. As in open space, when the optical potential is sufficiently deep, the atomic gas is in the Mott-like state. Inside the cavity, however, the potential depends on the atomic distribution, which determines the refractive index of the medium, thus altering the intracavity field amplitude. We derive the effective Bose-Hubbard model describing the physics of the system in one dimension and study the crossover between the superfluid -- Mott insulator quantum states. We determine the regions of parameters where the atomic insulator states are stable, and predict the existence of overlapping stability regions corresponding to competing insulator-like states. Bistable behavior, controlled by the pump intensity, is encountered in the vicinity of the shifted cavity resonance.

abstract: The activated surface diffusion of interacting adsorbates is described in terms of the so-called interacting single adsorbate approximation, which is applied to the diffusion of Na atoms on Cu(001) for coverages up to 20% in quasielastic He atom scattering experiments. This approximation essentially consists of solving the standard Langevin equation with two noise sources and frictions: a Gaussian white noise accounting for the friction with the substrate, and a white shot noise characterized by a collisional friction simulating the adsorbate-adsorbate collisions. The broadenings undergone by the quasielastic peak are found to be in very good agreement with the experimental data reported at two surface temperatures 200 and 300 K.

abstract: The understanding of the underlying dynamical mechanisms which determine the macroscopic laws of heat conduction is a long standing task of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. A better understanding of the mechanism of heat conduction may lead to potentially interesting applications based on the possibility to control the heat flow. Indeed, different models of thermal rectifiers has been recently proposed in which heat can flow preferentially in one direction. Although these models are far away from a prototype realization, the underlying mechanisms are of very general nature and, as such, are suitable of improvement and may eventually lead to real applications. We briefly discuss the problem of heat transport in classical and quantum systems and its relation to the chaoticity of the dynamics. We then study the phenomenon of thermal rectification and briefly discuss the different types of microscopic mechanisms that lead to the rectification of heat flow.

abstract: In this paper we discuss Bose-Einstein spinor condensates for F=1 atoms in the context of 87Rb, as studied experimentally by the Stamper-Kurn group [Sadler et al. Nature (2006)]. The dynamical quantum fluctuations of a sample that starts as a condensate of N atoms in a pure F=1, m_F = 0 state are described in analogy to the `two-mode squeezing' of quantum optics in terms of an su(1,1) algebra. In this system the initial m_F=0 condensate acts as a source (`pump') for the creation pairs of m_F =+1,-1 atoms. We show that even though the system as a whole is described by a pure state with zero entropy, the reduced density matrix for the m_F = +1 degree of freedom, obtained by tracing out the m_F = -1,0 degrees of freedom, corresponds to a thermal state. Furthermore, these quantum fluctuations of the initial dynamics of the system provide the seeds for the formation of domains of ferromagnetically aligned spins.

abstract: A GaAs/AlGaAs based two-qubit quantum device that allows the controlled generation and straightforward detection of entanglement by measuring a stationary current-voltage characteristic is proposed. We have developed a two-particle Green's function method of open systems and calculate the properties of three-dimensional interacting entangled systems non-perturbatively. We present concrete device designs and detailed, charge self-consistent predictions. One of the qubits is an all-electric Mach-Zehnder interferometer that consists of two electrostatically defined quantum wires with coupling windows, whereas the second qubit is an electrostatically defined double quantum dot located in a second two-dimensional electron gas beneath the quantum wires. We find that the entanglement of the device can be controlled externally by tuning the tunneling coupling between the two quantum dots.

We also describe an application in quantum theory.

abstract: We show that the coherence of an electron spin interacting with a bath of nuclear spins can exhibit a well-defined purely exponential decay for special (`narrowed') bath initial conditions in the presence of a strong applied magnetic field. This is in contrast to the typical case, where spin-bath dynamics have been investigated in the non-Markovian limit, giving super-exponential or power-law decay of correlation functions. We calculate the relevant decoherence time T_2 explicitly for free-induction decay and find a simple expression with dependence on bath polarization, magnetic field, the shape of the electron wave function, dimensionality, total nuclear spin I, and isotopic concentration for experimentally relevant heteronuclear spin systems.

abstract: We propose a symmetric version of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization Ansatz (MERA) in two spatial dimensions (2D) and use this Ansatz to find an unknown ground state of a 2D quantum system. Results in the simple 2D quantum Ising model on the $8\times8$ square lattice are found to be very accurate even with the smallest non-trivial truncation parameter.

abstract: It has been demonstrated, using variational methods, that quantum vacuum energy gravitates according to the equivalence principle, at least for the finite Casimir energies associated with perfectly conducting parallel plates. This conclusion holds independently of the orientation of the plates. We review these arguments and add further support to this conclusion by considering parallel semitransparent plates, that is, $\delta$-function potentials, acting on a massless scalar field, in a spacetime defined by Rindler coordinates. We calculate the force on systems consisting of one or two such plates undergoing acceleration perpendicular to the plates. In the limit of small acceleration we recover (via the equivalence principle) the situation of weak gravity, and find that the gravitational force on the system is just $M\mathbf{g}$, where $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration and $M$ is the total mass of the system, consisting of the mass of the plates renormalized by the Casimir energy of each plate separately, plus the energy of the Casimir interaction between the plates. This reproduces the previous result in the limit as the coupling to the $\delta$-function potential approaches infinity. Extension of this latter work to arbitrary orientation of the plates, and to general compact quantum vacuum energy configurations, is under development.

abstract: We present calculations of Casimir energy (CE) in a system of quantized electromagnetic (EM) field interacting with an infinite circular cylindrical shell (which we call `the defect'). Interaction is described in the only QFT-consistent way by Chern-Simon action concentrated on the defect, with a single coupling constant $a$. For regularization of UV divergencies of the theory we use % physically motivated Pauli-Villars regularization of the free EM action. The divergencies are extracted as a polynomial in regularization mass $M$, and they renormalize classical part of the surface action. We reveal the dependence of CE on the coupling constant $a$. Corresponding Casimir force is attractive for all values of $a$. For $a\to\infty$ we reproduce the known results for CE for perfectly conducting cylindrical shell first obtained by DeRaad and Milton.

abstract: The Kerr-Newman spinning particle displays some remarkable relations to the Dirac electron and has a reach spinor structure which is based on a twistorial description of the Kerr congruence determined by the Kerr theorem. We consider the relation between this spinor-twistorial structure and spinors of the Dirac equation, and show that the Dirac equation may naturally be incorporated into Kerr-Schild formalism as a master equation controlling the twistorial structure of Kerr geometry. As a result, the Dirac electron acquires an extended space-time structure having clear coordinate description with natural incorporation of a gravitational field. The relation between the Dirac wave function and Kerr geometry is realized via a chain of links: {\it Dirac wave function $ \Rightarrow $ Complex Kerr-Newman Source $ \Rightarrow $ Kerr Theorem $ \Rightarrow $ Real Kerr geometry.} As a result, the wave function acquires the role of an ``order parameter'' which controls spin, dynamics, and twistorial polarization of Kerr-Newman space-time.

abstract: Exact-diagonalization calculations for N=3 electrons in anisotropic quantum dots, covering a broad range of confinement anisotropies and strength of inter-electron repulsion, are presented for zero and low magnetic fields. The excitation spectra are analyzed as a function of the strength of the magnetic field and for increasing quantum-dot anisotropy. Analysis of the intrinsic structure of the many-body wave functions through spin-resolved two-point correlations reveals that the electrons tend to localize forming Wigner molecules. For certain ranges of dot parameters (mainly at strong anisotropy), the Wigner molecules acquire a linear geometry, and the associated wave functions with a spin projection S_z=1/2 are similar to the representative class of strongly entangled states referred to as W-states. For other ranges of parameters (mainly at intermediate anisotropy), the Wigner molecules exhibit a more complex structure consisting of two mirror isosceles triangles. This latter structure can be viewed as an embryonic unit of a zig-zag Wigner crystal in quantum wires. The degree of entanglement in three-electron quantum dots can be quantified through the use of the von Neumann entropy.

abstract: In the context of constrained quantum mechanics, reference systems are used to construct relational observables that are invariant under the action of the symmetry group. Upon measurement of a relational observable, the reference system undergoes an unavoidable measurement "back-action" that modifies its properties. In a quantum-gravitational setting, it has been argued that such a back-action may produce effects that are described at an effective level as a form of deformed (or doubly) special relativity. We examine this possibility using a simple constrained system that has been extensively studied in the context of quantum information. While our conclusions support the idea of a symmetry deformation, they also reveal a host of other effects that may be relevant to the context of quantum gravity, and could potentially conceal the symmetry deformation.

abstract: Among ${\cal P}$-pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H ={\cal P}^{-1} H^\dagger \cal P}$ with real spectra, the ''weakly pseudo-Hermitian" ones (i.e., those employing non-self-adjoint ${\cal P} \neq {\cal P}^\dagger$) form a remarkable subfamily. We list some reasons why it deserves a special attention. In particular we show that whenever ${\cal P} \neq {\cal P}^\dagger$, the current involutive operator of charge ${\cal C}$ gets complemented by a nonequivalent alternative involutive quasiparity operator ${\cal Q}$. We show how, in this language, the standard quantum mechanics is restored via the two alternative inner products in the physical Hilbert space of states, with $<\psi_1|{\cal PQ}|\psi_2>=< \psi_1|{\cal CP}|\psi_2>$.

We give a theoretical description of this effect supported by extensive numerical simulations. The proposed scheme can be implemented with existing experimental setups.

We also present the generalization of the parabolic coordinates, in which this system admits the separation of variables. Finally, we get the spherical analog of the presented MICZ-Kepler-like system.

abstract: We investigate how to create entangled states of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices by dynamically manipulating the shape of the lattice potential. We consider an additional potential (the superlattice) that allows both the splitting of each site into a double well potential, and the control of the height of potential barrier between sites. We use superlattice manipulations to perform entangling operations between neighbouring qubits encoded on the Zeeman levels of the atoms without having to perform transfers between the different vibrational states of the atoms. We show how to use superlattices to engineer many-body entangled states resilient to collective dephasing noise. Also, we present a method to realize a 2D resource for measurement-based quantum computing via Bell-pair measurements. We analyze measurement networks that allow the execution of quantum algorithms while maintaining the resilience properties of the system throughout the computation.

abstract: We demonstrate the operation of an atom interferometer based on a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We strongly reduce the interaction induced decoherence that usually limits interferometers based on trapped condensates by tuning the s-wave scattering length almost to zero via a magnetic Feshbach resonance. We employ a $^{39}$K condensate trapped in an optical lattice, where Bloch oscillations are forced by gravity. With a control of the scattering length better that 0.1 $a_0$ we achieve coherence times of several hundreds of ms. The micrometric sizes of the atomic sample make our sensor an ideal candidate for measuring forces with high spatial resolution. Our technique can be in principle extended to other measurement schemes opening new possibilities in the field of trapped atom interferometry.

Also the opposite task can be fulfilled, to construct an evolution leading to a prescribed stationary state.

abstract: We explore theoretically the novel superfluidity of harmonically-trapped polarized ultracold fermionic atoms in a two-dimensional (2D) optical lattice by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The pairing amplitude is found to oscillate along the radial direction at low particle density and along the angular direction at high density. The former is consistent with the existing experiments and the latter is a newly predicted Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which can be tested in experiments.

abstract: We study both numerically and analytically the possibility of using an adiabatic passage control method to construct a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in the time domain, in exact one-to-one correspondence with the traditional optical MZI that involves two beam splitters and two mirrors. The interference fringes one obtains from such a minimum-disturbance set up clearly demonstrates that, fundamentally, an atom laser is not monochromatic due to interatomic interactions. We also consider how the amount of entanglement in the system correlates to the interference fringes.

abstract: In our previous paper \cite{co1} we have shown that the theory of circulant matrices allows to recover the result that there exists $p+1$ Mutually Unbiased Bases in dimension $p$, $p$ being an arbitrary prime number. Two orthonormal bases $\mathcal B, \mathcal B'$ of $\mathbb C^d$ are said mutually unbiased if $\forall b\in \mathcal B, \forall b' \in \mathcal B'$ one has that $$| b\cdot b'| = \frac{1}{\sqrt d}$$ ($b\cdot b'$ hermitian scalar product in $\mathbb C^d$). In this paper we show that the theory of block-circulant matrices with circulant blocks allows to show very simply the known result that if $d=p^n$ ($p$ a prime number, $n$ any integer) there exists $d+1$ mutually Unbiased Bases in $\mathbb C^d$. Our result relies heavily on an idea of Klimov, Munoz, Romero \cite{klimuro}. As a subproduct we recover properties of quadratic Weil sums for $p\ge 3$, which generalizes the fact that in the prime case the quadratic Gauss sums properties follow from our results.

abstract: We discuss non-Hermitian field theories where the spectrum of the Hamiltonian involves only real energies. We make three observations. (i) The theories obtained from supersymmetric theories by nonanticommutative deformations belong in many cases to this class. (ii) When the deformation parameter is small, the deformed theory enjoys the same supersymmetry algebra as the undeformed one. Half of the supersymmetries are manifest and the existence of another half can be deduced from the structure of the spectrum. (iii) Generically, the conventionally defined S--matrix is not unitary for such theories.

We will explain how such singular Schr\"odinger operators can be properly defined for different codimensions of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, we are going to discuss their properties, in particular, the way in which the geometry of $\Gamma$ influences their spectra and the scattering, strong-coupling asymptotic behavior, and a discrete counterpart to leaky-graph Hamiltonians using point interactions. The subject cannot be regarded as closed at present, and we will add a list of open problems hoping that the reader will take some of them as a challenge.

abstract: Validation is often defined as the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of its intended uses. Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend increasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In this article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to formulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the process occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal representation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby replace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model by an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better adapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure factors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for validation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations. We illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum Mechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several concrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a cellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for solar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid dynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

abstract: For a positive integer $k$, the rank-$k$ numerical range $\Lambda_k(A)$ of an operator $A$ acting on a Hilbert space $\cH$ of dimension at least $k$ is the set of scalars $\lambda$ such that $PAP = \lambda P$ for some rank $k$ orthogonal projection $P$. In this paper, a close connection between low rank perturbation of an operator $A$ and $\Lambda_k(A)$ is established. In particular, for $1 \le r < k$ it is shown that $\Lambda_k(A) \subseteq \Lambda_{k-r}(A+F)$ for any operator $F$ with $\rank (F) \le r$. In quantum computing, this result implies that a quantum channel with a $k$-dimensional error correcting code under a perturbation of rank $\le r$ will still have a $(k-r)$-dimensional error correcting code. Moreover, it is shown that if $A$ is normal or if the dimension of $A$ is finite, then $\Lambda_k(A)$ can be obtained as the intersection of $\Lambda_{k-r}(A+F)$ for a collection of rank $r$ operators $F$. Examples are given to show that the result fails if $A$ is a general operator. The closure and the interior of the convex set $\Lambda_k(A)$ are completely determined. Analogous results are obtained for $\Lambda_\infty(A)$ defined as the set of scalars $\lambda$ such that $PAP = \lambda P$ for an infinite rank orthogonal projection $P$. It is shown that $\Lambda_\infty(A)$ is the intersection of all $\Lambda_k(A)$ for $k = 1, 2, >...$. If $A - \mu I$ is not compact for any $\mu \in \IC$, then the closure and the interior of $\Lambda_\infty(A)$ coincide with those of the essential numerical range of $A$. The situation for the special case when $A-\mu I$ is compact for some $\mu \in \IC$ is also studied.

We have calculated the reflection and transmission coefficients by the matching conditions on the wavefunctions, and investigated the condition for the existence of transmission resonances. Furthermore, we have demonstrated how the transmission-resonance condition depends on the shape of the potential.
