**1.    Quantum Walks and Gauge Fields in Discrete Space-Time**  
Pablo Arnault, Fabrice Debbasch  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00038  
<blockquote>
<p>
The connection between gauge fields and Discrete Time Quantum Walks (DTQWs) is revisited on a new family of (1 + 2)-dimensional walks whose continuous limit coincides with the dynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to arbitrary electromagnetic fields. The electromagnetic interpretation is extended beyond the continuous limit by proving that these DTQWs exhibit an exact discrete local $U(1)$ gauge invariance and by constructing a gauge-invariant discrete electromagnetic field. Numerical simulations outside the scope of the continuous limit confirm the existence of phenomena typical of the electromagnetic coupling, such as Bloch oscillations and the $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ drift. Applications to quantum simulations and quantum algorithmics are discussed.

**2.    Recursive quantum spatial search does not need ancilla qubit**  
Avatar Tulsi  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.00207  
<blockquote>
<p>
Spatial search is a widely studied application of quantum algorithms. Several algorithms have been proposed for spatial search without using ancilla qubits which are easier to implement physically. All such algorithms are based on the widely studied quantum walk approach. Here we consider another approach by Aaronson and Ambainis based on the recursive application of Grover's algorithm rather than quantum walks. Their algorithm needs one ancilla qubit for successful implementation. We present a different recursive algorithm which does not need any ancilla qubit and hence it offers physical implementation advantages.

**3.    Hyperentanglement-enhanced Weak Value Amplification with High-Order Correlation Function**  
Jing-Zheng Huang, Qin-Zheng Li, Chen Fang, Gui-Hua Zeng  
J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 48 (2015) 195501  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01268  
<blockquote>
<p>
By exploiting the hyperentanglement, we propose a new concrete scheme to realize weak value amplification, which can be implemented by N hyperentangled photons along with coincidence detection. Our scheme can optimally increase the amplification factor by a factor of N compared to the usage of N uncorrelated photons, and achieve the Heisenberg limit for the purpose of parameter estimation. We expect our study can inspire a further investigation on the usage of hyperentanglement in weak measurement and quantum metrology.

**4.    Spatial search by quantum walk is optimal for almost all graphs**  
Shantanav Chakraborty, Leonardo Novo, Andris Ambainis, Yasser Omar  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01327  
<blockquote>
<p>
Finding a given node in a network exploiting the speed-up offered by quantum search was only known to hold for a handful of specific graphs. In this work, we prove that for Erd\"os-Renyi random graphs, i.e.\ graphs of $n$ vertices where each edge exists with probability $p$, search by continuous time quantum walk is \textit{almost surely} optimal as long as $p\geq \log^{3/2}(n)/n$. Consequently, we prove that quantum spatial search is in fact optimal for \emph{almost all} graphs, meaning that the fraction of graphs of $n$ vertices for which this optimality holds tends to one in the asymptotic limit. Finally, we show that we can extend our results on search to establish high fidelity quantum communication between two arbitrary nodes of a random network of interacting qubits, namely to perform quantum state transfer, as well as entanglement generation. Our work shows that quantum information tasks typically designed for structured systems retain performance in very disordered structures.

**5.    Entanglement formation under random interactions**  
Christoph Wick, Jaegon Um, Haye Hinrichsen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01652  
<blockquote>
<p>
The temporal evolution of the entanglement between two qubits evolving by random interactions is studied analytically and numerically. Two different types of randomness are investigated. Firstly we analyze an ensemble of systems with randomly chosen but time-independent interaction Hamiltonians. Secondly we consider the case of a temporally fluctuating Hamiltonian, where the unitary evolution can be understood as a random walk on the SU (4) group manifold. As a by-product we compute the metric tensor and its inverse as well as the Laplace-Beltrami for SU (4).

**6.    Experimental quantum-walk revival with a time-dependent coin**  
Peng Xue, Rong Zhang, Hao Qin, Xiang Zhan, Zhihao Bian, Jian Li, Barry C. Sanders  
Physical Review Letters 114, 140502 (2015)  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.01989  
<blockquote>
<p>
We demonstrate a quantum walk with time-dependent coin bias. With this technique we realize an experimental single-photon one-dimensional quantum walk with a linearly-ramped time-dependent coin flip operation and thereby demonstrate two periodic revivals of the walker distribution. In our beam-displacer interferometer, the walk corresponds to movement between discretely separated transverse modes of the field serving as lattice sites, and the time-dependent coin flip is effected by implementing a different angle between the optical axis of half-wave plate and the light propagation at each step. Each of the quantum-walk steps required to realize a revival comprises two sequential orthogonal coin-flip operators, with one coin having constant bias and the other coin having a time-dependent ramped coin bias, followed by a conditional translation of the walker.

**7.    Two-dimensional quantum walk under artificial magnetic field**  
?. Yal??nkaya, Z. Gedik  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.03083  
<blockquote>
<p>
We introduce the Peierls substitution to two-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk on a square lattice to examine the spreading dynamics and the coin-position entanglement in the presence of an artificial gauge field. We use the ratio of magnetic flux through unit cell to the flux quantum as a control parameter. For a given flux ratio, we obtain faster spreading for small number of steps and the walker tends to be highly localized around the origin. Moreover, the spreading of the walk can be suppressed and decreased within a limited time interval for specific rational values of flux ratio. When the flux ratio is an irrational number, even for large number of steps, the spreading exhibit diffusive behavior rather than the well-known ballistic one as in the classical random walk and there is a significant probability to find the walker at the origin. We also analyse the coin-position entanglement and show that asymptotic behavior vanishes when the flux ratio is different from zero and the coin-position entanglement become maximal in a periodic manner at long-time range.

**8.    Simulating the discrete-time quantum walk dynamics with simultaneous coin and shift operators**  
Jalil Khatibi Moqadam, Marcos Cesar de Oliveira  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.05270  
<blockquote>
<p>
We implement the discrete-time quantum walk model using the continuous-time evolution of the Hamiltonian that includes both the shift and the coin generators. Based on the Trotter-Suzuki first-order approximation, we consider an optimization problem in which the Hellinger distance between the walker probability distributions resulted from the evolution of such Hamiltonian and the quantum walk dynamics is minimized. The phase space implementation of the quantum walk is considered where the walker state is encoded on the coherent state of a resonator and the coin on the two-level state of a qubit. In this approach, no mechanism for switching between the coin and the shift operators is included. We show the Hellinger distance is bounded for large number of time steps. The distance is small when we deviate from the standard quantum walk model, namely, when the walker is allowed to move in between the sites. In simulating the standard quantum walk model, the distance is large but bounded by $26\%$ for a relevant number of time steps. Even so, the system evolution shows the essential characteristics of the standard quantum walk dynamics, namely, the ballistic evolution of the probability distribution and the linear growth of the corresponding standard deviation. Moreover, the entanglement generated in this approach is approximately the same as the entanglement generated in the standard quantum walk dynamics. Finally, the system dynamics under the influence of the decoherence also shows the similar quantum-to-classical transition as in the standard quantum walk dynamics.

**9.    Quantum simulation of the Anderson Hamiltonian with an array of coupled nanoresonators: delocalization and thermalization effects**  
J. Lozada-Vera, A. Carrillo, O. P. de S�� Neto, J. Khatibi Moqadam, M. D. LaHaye, M. C. de Oliveira  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.06984  
<blockquote>
<p>
The possibility of using nanoelectromechanical systems as a simulation tool for quantum many-body effects is explored. It is demonstrated that an array of electrostatically coupled nanoresonators can effectively simulate the Bose-Hubbard model without interactions, corresponding in the single-phonon regime to the Anderson tight-binding model. Employing a density matrix formalism for the system coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, we study the interplay between disorder and thermalization, focusing on the delocalization process. It is found that the phonon population remains localized for low enough temperatures even if the total population of excitations is lost from the array due to dissipative effects; with increasing temperatures the localization is lost due to thermal pumping of excitations into the array, producing in the steady regime a fully thermalized system. Finally, we consider a possible experimental design to measure the phonon population in the array by means of a superconducting qubit coupled to individual nanoresonators. We also consider the possibility of using the proposed quantum simulator for realizing continuous-time quantum walks.

**10.    Symmetry Protected Topological Phases and Majorana Mode in One-dimensional Quantum Walk with Boundary**  
Ho Tat Lam, Yue Yu, Kwok Yip Szeto  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.07528  
<blockquote>
<p>
The topological phases in one-dimensional quantum walk can be classified by the coin parameters. By solving for the general exact solutions of bound states in one-dimensional quantum walk with boundaries specified by different coin parameters, we show that these bound states are Majorana modes with quasi-energy $E=0,\pi$. These modes are qualitatively different for different boundary conditions used. For two-boundary system with symmetric boundary conditions, the interaction energy between two Majorana bound states can be computed, as in the case of a finite wire. Suggestion of observing these modes are provided.

**11.    Generic Quantum Walks with Memory**  
Dan Li, Michael Mc Gettrick, Fei Gao, Jie Xu, Qiao-Yan Wen  
http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1508.07674  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks with memory are a type of modified quantum walk that records the walker's latest path. In this work, we show that a quantum walk with memory on a digraph can be transformed as a quantum walk without memory on the line digraph of the original one. With this correspondence, we construct a model which includes all possible standard quantum walks with memory on regular graphs. This construction would help us to study quantum walks with memory and also help in corresponding experiments. Based on this model, by taking the straight line as example, we study the general properties of quantum walks with memory, such as variance, occupancy rate and localization. Interestingly, we find that a quantum walk with memory can produce the same probability distribution as that of a standard quantum walk whose initial spin state is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}|0\rangle_p(|1\rangle_c+i|-1\rangle_c)$.
