**1.    Quantum scattering theory on graphs with tails**  
Martin Varbanov, Todd A. Brun  
Phys. Rev. A 80, 052330 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2825  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum walks on a finite graphs to which infinite tails are attached. We explore how the propagating and bound states depend on the structure of the finite graph. The S-matrix for such graphs is defined. Its unitarity is proved as well as some other of its properties such as its transformation under time reversal. A spectral decomposition of the identity for the Hamiltonian of the graph is derived using its eigenvectors. We derive formulas for the S-matrix of a graph under certain operation such as cutting a tail, attaching a tail or connecting two tails to form an edge.

**2.    Inhomogeneous Quantum Walks**  
Noah Linden, James Sharam  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3692  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study a natural construction of a general class of inhomogeneous quantum walks (namely walks whose transition probabilities depend on position). Within the class we analyze walks that are periodic in position and show that, depending on the period, such walks can be bounded or unbounded in time; in the latter case we analyze the asymptotic speed. We compare the construction to others in the existing literature. As an example we give a quantum version of a non-irreducible classical walk: the Polya Urn.
