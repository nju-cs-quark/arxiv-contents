**1.    Quantum searches on highly symmetric graphs**  
Daniel Reitzner, Mark Hillery, Edgar Feldman, Vladimir Buzek  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 012323 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1237  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study scattering quantum walks on highly symmetric graphs and use the walks to solve search problems on these graphs. The particle making the walk resides on the edges of the graph, and at each time step scatters at the vertices. All of the vertices have the same scattering properties except for a subset of special vertices. The object of the search is to find a special vertex. A quantum circuit implementation of these walks is presented in which the set of special vertices is specified by a quantum oracle. We consider the complete graph, a complete bipartite graph, and an $M$-partite graph. In all cases, the dimension of the Hilbert space in which the time evolution of the walk takes place is small (between three and six), so the walks can be completely analyzed analytically. Such dimensional reduction is due to the fact that these graphs have large automorphism groups. We find the usual quadratic quantum speedups in all cases considered.

**2.    Recurrence properties of unbiased coined quantum walks on infinite $d$-dimensional lattices**

The P\'olya number characterizes the recurrence of a random walk. We apply the generalization of this concept to quantum walks [M. \v{S}tefa\v{n}\'ak, I. Jex and T. Kiss, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{100}, 020501 (2008)] which is based on a specific measurement scheme. The P\'olya number of a quantum walk depends in general on the choice of the coin and the initial coin state, in contrast to classical random walks where the lattice dimension uniquely determines it. We analyze several examples to depict the variety of possible recurrence properties. First, we show that for the class of quantum walks driven by independent coins for all spatial dimensions, the P\'olya number is independent of the initial conditions and the actual coin operators, thus resembling the property of the classical walks. We provide an analytical estimation of the P\'olya number for this class of quantum walks. Second, we examine the 2-D Grover walk, which exhibits localisation and thus is recurrent, except for a particular initial state for which the walk is transient. We generalize the Grover walk to show that one can construct in arbitrary dimensions a quantum walk which is recurrent. This is in great contrast with the classical walks which are recurrent only for the dimensions $d=1,2$. Finally, we analyze the recurrence of the 2-D Fourier walk. This quantum walk is recurrent except for a two-dimensional subspace of the initial states. We provide an analytical formula of the P\'olya number in its dependence on the initial state.

**3.    Improved constructions of quantum automata**  
Andris Ambainis, Nikolajs Nahimovs  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1686  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a simple construction of quantum automata which achieve an exponential advantage over classical finite automata. Our automata use \frac{4}{\epsilon} \log 2p + O(1) states to recognize a language that requires p states classically. The construction is both substantially simpler and achieves a better constant in the front of \log p than the previously known construction of Ambainis and Freivalds (quant-ph/9802062). Similarly to Ambainis and Freivalds, our construction is by a probabilistic argument. We consider the possibility to derandomize it and present some results in this direction.

**4.    Environment-Assisted Quantum Walks in Photosynthetic Energy Transfer**  
Masoud Mohseni, Patrick Rebentrost, Seth Lloyd, Al��n Aspuru-Guzik  
Journal of Chemical Physics 129, 174106 (2008)

<blockquote>
<p>
Energy transfer within photosynthetic systems can display quantum effects such as delocalized excitonic transport. Recently, direct evidence of long-lived coherence has been experimentally demonstrated for the dynamics of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein complex [Engel et al., Nature 446, 782 (2007)]. However, the relevance of quantum dynamical processes to the exciton transfer efficiency is to a large extent unknown. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying the role of quantum interference effects in energy transfer dynamics of molecular arrays interacting with a thermal bath within the Lindblad formalism. To this end, we generalize continuous-time quantum walks to non-unitary and temperature-dependent dynamics in Liouville space derived from a microscopic Hamiltonian. Different physical effects of coherence and decoherence processes are explored via a universal measure for the energy transfer efficiency and its susceptibility. In particular, we demonstrate that for the FMO complex an effective interplay between free Hamiltonian and thermal fluctuations in the environment leads to a substantial increase in energy transfer efficiency from about 70% to 99%.

**5.    Winding up by a quench: Insulator to superfluid phase transition in a ring of BECs**  
J. Dziarmaga, J. Meisner, W.H. Zurek  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 115701 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.1025  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study phase transition from the Mott insulator to superfluid in a periodic optical lattice. Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts buildup of winding number through random walk of BEC phases, with the step size scaling as a the third root of transition rate. We confirm this and demonstrate that this scaling accounts for the net winding number after the transition.
