**1.    Spatial entanglement using a quantum walk on a many-body system**  
Sandeep K. Goyal, C. M. Chandrashekar

<blockquote>
<p>
The evolution of a many-particle system on a one-dimensional lattice, subjected to a quantum walk can cause spatial entanglement in the lattice position, which can be exploited for quantum information/communication purposes. We demonstrate the evolution of spatial entanglement and its dependence on the quantum coin operation parameters, the number of particles present in the lattice and the number of steps of quantum walk on the system. Thus, spatial entanglement can be controlled and optimized using a many-particle discrete-time quantum walk.

**2.    Faster transport with a directed quantum walk**  
Stephan Hoyer, David A. Meyer  
Phys. Rev. A 79, 024307 (2009)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1007  
<blockquote>
<p>
We give the first example of faster transport with a quantum walk on an inherently directed graph, on the directed line with a variable number of self-loops at each vertex. These self-loops can be thought of as adding a number of small dimensions. This is a discrete time quantum walk using the Fourier transform coin, where the walk proceeds a distance $\Theta(1)$ in constant time compared to $\Theta(1/n)$ classically, independent of the number of these small dimensions. The analysis proceeds by reducing this walk to a walk with a two dimensional coin.

**3.    Asymptotic entanglement in a two-dimensional quantum walk**

<p>
The evolution operator of a discrete-time quantum walk involves a conditional shift in position space which entangles the coin and position degrees of freedom of the walker. After several steps, the coin-position entanglement (CPE) converges to a well defined value which depends on the initial state. In this work we provide an analytical method which allows for the exact calculation of the asymptotic reduced density operator and the corresponding CPE for a discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional lattice. We use the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator as an entanglement measure. The method is applied to the case of a Hadamard walk for which the dependence of the resulting CPE on initial conditions is obtained. Initial states leading to maximum or minimum CPE are identified and the relation between the coin or position entanglement present in the initial state of the walker and the final level of CPE is discussed. The CPE obtained from separable initial states satisfies an additivity property in terms of CPE of the corresponding one-dimensional cases. Non-local initial conditions are also considered and we find that the extreme case of an initial uniform position distribution leads to the largest CPE variation.

**4.    Matrix valued Szego polynomials and quantum random walks**  
M. J. Cantero, F. A. Gr��nbaum, L. Moral, L. Velazquez

<blockquote>
<p>
We consider quantum random walks (QRW) on the integers, a subject that has been considered in the last few years in the framework of quantum computation. We show how the theory of CMV matrices gives a natural tool to study these processes and to give results that are analogous to those that Karlin and McGregor developed to study (classical) birth-and-death processes using orthogonal polynomials on the real line. In perfect analogy with the classical case the study of QRWs on the set of non-negative integers can be handled using scalar valued (Laurent) polynomials and a scalar valued measure on the circle. In the case of classical or quantum random walks on the integers one needs to allow for matrix valued versions of these notions. We show how our tools yield results in the well known case of the Hadamard walk, but we go beyond this translation invariant model to analyze examples that are hard to analyze using other methods. More precisely we consider QRWs on the set of non- negative integers. The analysis of these cases leads to phenomena that are absent in the case of QRWs on the integers even if one restricts oneself to a constant coin. This is illustrated here by studying recurrence properties of the walk, but the same method can be used for other purposes. The presentation here aims at being selfcontained, but we re- frain from trying to give an introduction to quantum random walks, a subject well surveyed in the literature we quote. For two excellent reviews, see [1, 18]. See also the recent notes [19].

**5.    Quantum Walk-based Generation of Entanglement Between Two Walkers**  
Salvador E. Venegas-Andraca, Sougato Bose  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3946  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks can be used either as tools for quantum algorithm development or as entanglement generators, potentially useful to test quantum hardware. We present a novel algorithm based on a discrete Hadamard quantum walk on a line with one coin and two walkers whose purpose is to generate entanglement between walkers. We provide several classical computer simulations of our quantum algorithm in which we show that, although the asymptotical amount of entanglement generated between walkers does not reach the highest degree of entanglement possible at each step for either coin measurement outcome, the entanglement ratio (entanglement generated/highest value of entanglement possible, for each step) tends to converge, and the actual convergence value depends on the coin initial state and on the coin measurement outcome. Furthermore, our numerical simulations show that, for the quantum walks used in our algorithm, the value towards which entanglement ratio converges also depends on the position probability distribution symmetry of a quantum walk computed with one single walker and the same coin initial state employed in the corresponding quantum walk with two walkers.

**6.    Group Velocity of Discrete-Time Quantum Walks**  
Achim Kempf, Renato Portugal  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4237  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that certain types of quantum walks can be modeled as waves that propagate in a medium with phase and group velocities that are explicitly calculable. Since the group and phase velocities indicate how fast wave packets can propagate causally, we propose the use of these wave velocities in a new definition for the hitting time of quantum walks. The new definition of hitting time has the advantage that it requires neither the specification of a walker's initial condition nor of an arrival probability threshold. We give full details for the case of quantum walks on the Cayley graphs of Abelian groups. This includes the special cases of quantum walks on the line and on hypercubes.

**7.    Absorption Probabilities for the Two-Barrier Quantum Walk**  
Eric Bach, Lev Borisov  
http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4349  
<blockquote>
<p>
Let p_j^(n) be the probability that a Hadamard quantum walk, started at site j on the integer lattice {0,...,n}, is absorbed at 0. We give an explicit formula for p_j^(n). Our formula proves a conjecture of John Watrous, concerning an empirically observed linear fractional recurrence relation for the numbers p_1^(n).
