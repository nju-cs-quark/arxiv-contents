**1.    Survival probability in a one-dimensional quantum walk on a trapped lattice**  
Meltem Gonulol, Ekrem Aydiner, Yutaka Shikano, Ozgur E. Mustecaplioglu  
New J. Phys. 13, 033037 (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0085  
<blockquote>
<p>
The dynamics of the survival probability of quantum walkers on a one-dimensional lattice with random distribution of absorbing immobile traps are investigated. The survival probability of quantum walkers is compared with that of classical walkers. It is shown that the time dependence of survival probability of quantum walkers has a piecewise stretched exponential character depending on the density of traps in numerical and analytical observations. The crossover between the quantum analogs of the Rosenstock and Donsker-Varadhan behaviors is identified.

**2.    Limit theorems for a localization model of 2-state quantum walks**  
Takuya Machida  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1116  
<blockquote>
<p>
We consider 2-state quantum walks (QWs) on the line, which are defined by two matrices. One of the matrices operates the walk at only half-time. In the usual QWs, localization does not occur at all. However, our walk can be localized around the origin. In this paper, we present two limit theorems, that is, one is a stationary distribution and the other is a convergence theorem in distribution.

**3.    Universal quantum computation by discontinuous quantum walk**  
Michael S. Underwood, David L. Feder  
Phys. Rev. A 82, 042304 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3578  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum walks are the quantum-mechanical analog of random walks, in which a quantum `walker' evolves between initial and final states by traversing the edges of a graph, either in discrete steps from node to node or via continuous evolution under the Hamiltonian furnished by the adjacency matrix of the graph. We present a hybrid scheme for universal quantum computation in which a quantum walker takes discrete steps of continuous evolution. This `discontinuous' quantum walk employs perfect quantum state transfer between two nodes of specific subgraphs chosen to implement a universal gate set, thereby ensuring unitary evolution without requiring the introduction of an ancillary coin space. The run time is linear in the number of simulated qubits and gates. The scheme allows multiple runs of the algorithm to be executed almost simultaneously by starting walkers one timestep apart.

**4.    Quantum walks: decoherence and coin-flipping games**  
Alejandro Romanelli, Guzm��n Hern��ndez  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3924  
<blockquote>
<p>
We investigate the global chirality distribution of the quantum walk on the line when decoherence is introduced either through simultaneous measurements of the chirality and particle position, or as a result of broken links. The first mechanism drives the system towards a classical diffusive behavior. This is used to build new quantum games, similar to the spin-flip game. The second mechanism involves two different possibilities: (a) All the quantum walk links have the same probability of being broken. (b) Only the quantum walk links on a half-line are affected by random breakage. In case (a) the decoherence drives the system to a classical Markov process, whose master equation is equivalent to the dynamical equation of the quantum density matrix. This is not the case in (b) where the asymptotic global chirality distribution unexpectedly maintains some dependence with the initial condition. Explicit analytical equations are obtained for all cases.

**5.    Localization of discrete-time quantum walks on a half line via the CGMV method**  
Norio Konno, Etsuo Segawa  
Quantum Information and Computation 11 (2011) pp. 0485-0495  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5109  
<blockquote>
<p>
We study discrete-time quantum walks on a half line by means of spectral analysis. Cantero et al. [1] showed that the CMV matrix, which gives a recurrence relation for the orthogonal Laurent polynomials on the unit circle [2], expresses the dynamics of the quantum walk. Using the CGMV method introduced by them, the name is taken from their initials, we obtain the spectral measure for the quantum walk. As a corollary, we give another proof for localization of the quantum walk on homogeneous trees shown by Chisaki et al. [3].

**6.    Parrondo's game using a discrete-time quantum walk**  
C. M. Chandrashekar, Subhashish Banerjee  
Physics Letters A 375 (2011), pp. 1553-1558  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.5121  
<blockquote>
<p>
We present a new form of a Parrondo game using discrete-time quantum walk on a line. The two players A and B with different quantum coins operators, individually losing the game can develop a strategy to emerge as joint winners by using their coins alternatively, or in combination for each step of the quantum walk evolution. We also present a strategy for a player A (B) to have a winning probability more than player B (A). Significance of the game strategy in information theory and physical applications are also discussed.

**7.    Collective modes in multiband superfluids and superconductors: Multiple dynamical classes**  
Yukihiro Ota, Masahiko Machida, Tomio Koyama, Hideo Aoki  
Phys. Rev. B 83, 060507(R) (2011)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3212  
<blockquote>
<p>
One important way to characterize the states having a gauge symmetry spontaneously broken over multibands should be to look at their collective excitation modes. We find that a three-band system has multiple Leggett modes with significantly different masses, which can be classified into different dynamical classes according to whether multiple inter-band Josephson currents add or cancel. This provides a way to dynamically characterize multiband superconductivity while the pairing symmetry is a static property.

**8.    Noise-enhanced trapping in chaotic scattering**  
Eduardo G. Altmann, Antonio Endler  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 205, 244102 (2010)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3935  
<blockquote>
<p>
We show that noise enhances the trapping of trajectories in scattering systems. In fully chaotic systems, the decay rate can decrease with increasing noise due to a generic mismatch between the noiseless escape rate and the value predicted by the Liouville measure of the exit set. In Hamiltonian systems with mixed phase space we show that noise leads to a slower algebraic decay due to trajectories performing a random walk inside Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser islands. We argue that these noise-enhanced trapping mechanisms exist in most scattering systems and are likely to be dominant for small noise intensities, which is confirmed through a detailed investigation in the Henon map. Our results can be tested in fluid experiments, affect the fractal Weyl's law of quantum systems, and modify the estimations of chemical reaction rates based on phase-space transition state theory.
