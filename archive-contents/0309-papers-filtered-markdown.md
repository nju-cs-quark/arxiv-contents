**1.    One dimensional quantum walk with unitary noise**  
Daniel Shapira, Ofer Biham, A.J. Bracken, Michelle Hackett  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309063  
<blockquote>
<p>
The effect of unitary noise on the discrete one-dimensional quantum walk is studied using computer simulations. For the noiseless quantum walk, starting at the origin (n=0) at time t=0, the position distribution Pt(n) at time t is very different from the Gaussian distribution obtained for the classical random walk. Furthermore, its standard deviation, sigma(t) scales as sigma(t) ~ t, unlike the classical random walk for which sigma(t) ~ sqrt{t}. It is shown that when the quantum walk is exposed to unitary noise, it exhibits a crossover from quantum behavior for short times to classical-like behavior for long times. The crossover time is found to be T ~ alpha^(-2) where alpha is the standard deviation of the noise.

**2.    Weak limits for quantum random walks**  
Geoffrey Grimmett, Svante Janson, Petra Scudo  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309135  
<blockquote>
<p>
We formulate and prove a general weak limit theorem for quantum random walks in one and more dimensions. With $X_n$ denoting position at time $n$, we show that $X_n/n$ converges weakly as $n \to \infty$ to a certain distribution which is absolutely continuous and of bounded support. The proof is rigorous and makes use of Fourier transform methods. This approach simplifies and extends certain preceding derivations valid in one dimension that make use of combinatorial and path integral methods.

**3.    Fluctuations of Quantum Random Walks on Circles**  
Norio Inui, Yoshinao Konishi, Norio Konno, Takahiro Soshi  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0309204  
<blockquote>
<p>
Temporal fluctuations in the Hadamard walk on circles are studied. A temporal standard deviation of probability that a quantum random walker is positive at a given site is introduced to manifest striking differences between quantum and classical random walks. An analytical expression of the temporal standard deviation on a circle with odd sites is shown and its asymptotic behavior is considered for large system size. In contrast with classical random walks, the temporal fluctuation of quantum random walks depends on the position and initial conditions, since temporal standard deviation of the classical case is zero for any site. It indicates that the temporal fluctuation of the Hadamard walk can be controlled.
