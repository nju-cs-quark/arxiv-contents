abstract: The ionization of atoms by strong, low-frequency fields can generally be described well by assuming that the photoelectron is, after the ionization step, completely at the mercy of the laser field. However, certain phenomena, like the recent discovery of low-energy structures in the long-wavelength regime, require the inclusion of the Coulomb interaction with the ion once the electron is in the continuum. We explore the first-principles inclusion of this interaction, known as analytical R-matrix theory, and its consequences on the corresponding quantum orbits. We show that the trajectory must have an imaginary component, and that this causes branch cuts in the complex time plane when the real trajectory revisits the neighbourhood of the ionic core. We provide a framework for consistently navigating these branch cuts based on closest-approach times, which satisfy the equation $\mathbf{r}(t) \cdot \mathbf{v}(t) = 0$ in the complex plane. We explore the geometry of these roots and describe the geometrical structures underlying the emergence of LES in both the classical and quantum domains.

abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is calculated exactly for mode-partitioned isolated systems such as the two-mode squeezed state and the multi-mode Silbey-Harris polaron ansatz state. Effective thermodynamic descriptions of the correlated partitions are constructed to present quantum information theory concepts in the language of thermodynamics. Boltzmann weights are obtained from the entanglement spectrum by deriving the exact relationship between an effective temperature and the physical entanglement parameters. The partition function of the resulting effective thermal theory can be obtained directly from the single-copy entanglement.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.00068
abstract: The standard treatment of the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) effect assumes one can calculate the phase without accounting for the source (solenoid) quantum mechanically. Recently, Vaidman, using a semi-classical calculation, showed that the source may indeed matter. He argued for what might be called a local field hypothesis---the idea that in quantum theory, as in classical physics, only field-producing potentials have physical effects. His calculation indicates that the electron's non-relativistic electric field, acting on a semi-classically treated solenoid, produces the A-B phase shift. Here, employing a model of the solenoid consisting of charged particles, we give a quantum mechanical treatment of their contribution to the phase shift under the influence of the circulating electron's electric field. We show that the phase shift of the field-producing non-relativistic vector potential gives the A-B phase shift, and how this confirms Vaidman's semi-classical prediction of that phase shift. However, we also show that the phase shift of the field-producing relativistic (retarded) scalar potential gives the negative of the A-B phase shift. This cancellation allows one to effectively treat the source as a classical entity as is done in the standard derivation of the A-B effect. We close by remarking that the apparent necessity for relativistic considerations suggests the possibility that the A-B phase shift may yet be explained in terms of field-producing potentials alone, which may vindicate the local field hypothesis.

abstract: We propose a quantum processor for the scalable quantum computation based on microwave photons in 1D superconducting resonators. Different from the previous processors which are composed of some resonators coupled to a superconducting qubit, our processor is composed of some resonators $r_i$ and a common resonator R acting as a quantum bus, which makes it have the capability of integrating more resonators simply by coupling them to the bus $R$ in different positions. R is coupled to only one transmon qutrit, and the coupling strengths between $r_i$ and R can be fully tuned. To show the processor can be used to achieve universal quantum computation effectively, we present a scheme to complete the high-fidelity quantum state transfer between two microwave-photon resonators and another one for the high-fidelity controlled-phase gate on them.

We determine the limit of the resolution for the sensitivity of the magnetometry achieved using either single-photon or multiphoton inputs. For the case of a microwave cavity containing an ensemble of Nitrogen-vacancy defects in diamond, we obtain a magnetometry sensitivity exceeding $0.5~\text{\nano\tesla}/\sqrt{\text{\hertz}}$, utilizing a single photon probe field, while for a multiphoton input we achieve a sensitivity about $1 \text{\femto\tesla}/\sqrt{\text{\hertz}}$, using a coherent probe microwave field with power of $P_\text{in}=1~\text{\nano\watt}$.

abstract: We present an efficient scheme for the generation of NOON states of photons in circuit QED assisted by a superconducting charge qutrit. It is completed with two kinds of manipulations, that is, the resonant operation on the qutrit and the resonator, and the single-qubit operation on the qutrit, and they both are high-fidelity operations. Compared with the one by a superconducting transmon qutrit proposed by Su et al. (Sci. Rep. 4, 3898 (2014)), our scheme does not require to maintain the qutrit in the third excited state with a long time, which relaxes the difficulty of its implementation in experiment. Moreover, the level anharmonicity of a charge qutrit is larger and it is better for us to tune the different transitions of the charge qutrit resonant to the resonator, which makes our scheme faster than others.

abstract: We propose a superconducting circuit comprising a dc-SQUID with mechanically compliant arm embedded in a coplanar microwave cavity that realizes an optomechanical system with a degenerate or non-degenerate parametric interaction generated via the dynamical Casimir effect. For experimentally feasible parameters, this setup is capable of reaching the single-photon, ultra-strong coupling regime, while simultaneously possessing a parametric coupling strength approaching the renormalized cavity frequency. This opens up the possibility of observing the interplay between these two fundamental nonlinearities at the single-photon level.

The two entanglement-based schemes consist of an entanglement distribution protocol with an untrusted source and an entanglement swapping protocol with an untrusted relay. Simulation results show that the noiseless linear amplifiers can improve the performance of these two protocols, in terms of maximal transmission distances, when we consider small amounts of entanglement, as typical in realistic setups.

abstract: We study the photon statistics properties of few-photon transport in an optomechanical system where an optomechanical cavity couples to two empty cavities. By analytically deriving the one- and two-photon currents in terms of a zero-time-delayed two-order correlation function, we show that a photon blockade can be achieved in both the single-photon strong-coupling regime and the single-photon weak-coupling regime due to the nonlinear interacting and multipath interference. Furthermore, our systems can be applied as a quantum optical diode, a single-photon source, and a quantum optical capacitor. It is shown that this the photon transport controlling devices based on photon antibunching does not require the stringent single-photon strong-coupling condition. Our results provide a promising platform for the coherent manipulation of optomechanics, which has potential applications for quantum information processing and quantum circuit realization.

abstract: In a hybrid optomechanical setup consisting of a two-level atom in a cavity with a pendular end-mirror, the interplay between the light field's radiation pressure on the mirror and the dipole interaction with the atom can lead to a blockade effect, which manifests itself in a suppression of Rabi oscillations in the atomic population. This effect is present when the system is in the single photon strong coupling regime and has an analogy in the photon blockade of optomechanics.

abstract: Consider a two-party correlation that can be generated by performing local measurements on a bipartite quantum system. A question of fundamental importance is to understand how many resources, which we quantify by the dimension of the underlying quantum system, are needed to reproduce this correlation. In this paper, we identify an easy-to-compute lower bound on the smallest Hilbert space dimension needed to generate a given two-party quantum correlation. We show that our bound is tight on the correlations generated by optimal quantum strategies for the CHSH Game and the Magic Square Game. We also identify sufficient conditions for showing that a correlation cannot be generated using finite-dimensional quantum strategies. Using this we give alternative proofs that a family of PR-boxes and all correlations corresponding to perfect strategies for the Fortnow-Feige-Lov\'asz Game cannot be realized using finitely many qubits.

abstract: We consider the recent relativistic bit commitment protocol introduced by Lunghi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2015] and present a new security analysis against classical attacks. In particular, while the initial complexity of the protocol scaled double-exponentially with the commitment time, our analysis shows that the correct dependence is only linear. This has dramatic implications in terms of implementation: in particular, the commitment time can easily be made arbitrarily long, by only requiring both parties to communicate classically and perform efficient classical computation.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.00240
abstract: We consider the related notions of two-prover and of relativistic commitment schemes. In recent work, Lunghi et al. proposed a new relativistic commitment scheme with a multi-round sustain phase that enables to keep the binding property alive as long as the sustain phase is running. They prove security of their scheme against classical attacks; however, the proven bound on the error parameter is very weak: it blows up doubly exponentially in the number of rounds. In this work, we give a new analysis of the multi-round scheme of Lunghi et al., and we show a linear growth of the error parameter instead (also considering classical attacks only). Our analysis is based on a new and rather general composition theorem for two-prover commitment schemes. The proof of our composition theorem is based on a better understanding of the binding property of two-prover commitments that we provide in the form of new definitions and relations among them. These new insights are certainly of independent interest and are likely to be useful in other contexts as well. Finally, our work gives rise to several interesting open problems, for instance extending our results to the quantum setting, where the dishonest provers are allowed to perform measurements on an entangled quantum state in order to try to break the binding property.

abstract: We study the role of quantum statistics in the self-ordering of ultracold bosons and fermions moving inside an optical resonator with transverse coherent pumping. For few particles we numerically compute the nonequilibrium dynamics of the density matrix towards the self-ordered stationary state of the coupled atom-cavity system. We include quantum fluctuations of the particles and the cavity field. These fluctuations in conjunction with cavity cooling determine the stationary distribution of the particles, which exhibits a transition from a homogeneous to a spatially ordered phase with the appearance of a superradiant scattering peak in the cavity output spectrum. At the same time the cavity field $Q$-function changes from a single to a double peaked distribution. While the ordering threshold is generally lower for bosons, we confirm the recently predicted zero pump strength threshold for superradiant scattering for fermions when the cavity photon momentum coincides with twice the Fermi momentum.

abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle as constraint on fermionic occupation numbers is a consequence of the much deeper fermionic exchange statistics. Just recently, it was shown by Klyachko that this antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions leads to further restrictions on natural occupation numbers. These so-called generalized Pauli constraints (GPC) significantly strengthen Pauli's exclusion principle. Our first goal is to develop an understanding of the mathematical concepts behind Klyachko's work, in the context of quantum marginal problems. Afterwards, we explore the physical relevance of GPC and study concrete physical systems from that new viewpoint. In the first part of this thesis we review Klyachko's solution of the univariate quantum marginal problem. In particular we break his abstract derivation based on algebraic topology down to a more elementary level and reveal the geometrical picture behind it. The second part explores the possible physical relevance of GPC. We review the effect of pinning, i.e. the saturation of some GPC by given natural occupation numbers and explain its consequences. Although this effect would be quite spectacular we argue that pinning is unnatural. Instead, we conjecture the effect of quasipinning, defined by occupation numbers close to (but not exactly on) the boundary of the allowed region. In the third part we study concrete fermionic quantum systems from the new viewpoint of GPC. In particular, we compute the natural occupation numbers for the ground state of a family of interacting fermions in a harmonic potential. Intriguingly, we find that the occupation numbers are strongly quasipinned, even up to medium interaction strengths. We identify this as an effect of the lowest few energy eigenstates, which provides first insights into the mechanism behind quasipinning.

abstract: The quantum relative entropy between two states satisfies a monotonicity property meaning that applying the same quantum channel to both states can never increase their relative entropy. It is known that this inequality is only tight when there is a "recovery map" that exactly reverses the effects of the quantum channel on both states. In this paper we strengthen this inequality by showing that the difference of relative entropies is bounded below by the measured relative entropy between the first state and a recovered state from its processed version. The recovery map is a convex combination of rotated Petz recovery maps and perfectly reverses the quantum channel on the second state. As a special case we reproduce recent lower bounds on the conditional mutual information such as the one proved in [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664]. Our proof only relies on elementary properties of pinching maps and the operator logarithm.

abstract: In this paper we return to the problem of reduced-state dynamics in the presence of an interacting environment. The question we investigate is how to appropriately model a particular system evolution given some knowledge of the system-environment interaction. When the experimenter takes into account certain known features of the interaction such as its invariant subspaces or its non-local content, it may not be possible to consistently model the system evolution over a certain time interval using a standard Stinespring dilation, which assumes the system and environment to be initially uncorrelated. Simple examples demonstrating how restrictions can emerge are presented below. When the system and environment are qubits, we completely characterize the set of unitaries that always generate reduced dynamics capable of being modeled using a consistent Stinespring dilation. Finally, we show how any initial correlations between the system and environment can be certified by observing the system transformation alone during certain joint evolutions.

abstract: We control the relative coupling strength of carrier and first order motional sideband interactions of a trapped ion by placing it in a resonant optical standing wave. Our configuration uses the surface of a microfabricated chip trap as a mirror, avoiding technical challenges of in-vacuum optical cavities. Displacing the ion along the standing wave, we show a periodic suppression of the carrier and sideband transitions with the cycles for the two cases $180^\circ$ out of phase with each other. This technique allows for suppression of off-resonant carrier excitations when addressing the motional sidebands, with applications in quantum simulation and quantum control. Using the standing wave fringes, we measure the relative ion height as a function of applied electric field, allowing for a precise measurement of ion displacement and, combined with measured micromotion amplitudes, a validation of trap numerical models.

abstract: Based on homodyne detection, we discuss how the presence of an event horizon affects quantum communication between an inertial partner, Alice, and a uniformly accelerated partner, Rob. We show that there exists a low frequency cutoff for Rob's homodyne detector that maximizes the signal to noise ratio and it approximately corresponds to the Unruh frequency. In addition, the low frequency cutoff which minimizes the conditional variance between Alice's input state and Rob's output state is also approximately equal to the Unruh frequency. Thus the Unruh frequency provides a natural low frequency cutoff in order to optimize quantum communication of both classical and quantum information between Alice and Rob.

The temperature of the diamond is inversely proportional to its size. An inertial observer can detect this thermal radiation by coupling to the diamond modes using an appropriate energy scaled detector. We further investigate the correlations between various diamonds and find that entanglement between adjacent diamonds dominates.

abstract: Span programs are a model of computation that have been used to design quantum algorithms, mainly in the query model. For any decision problem, there exists a span program that leads to an algorithm with optimal quantum query complexity, but finding such an algorithm is generally challenging. We consider new ways of designing quantum algorithms using span programs. We show how any span program that decides a problem $f$ can also be used to decide "property testing" versions of $f$, or more generally, approximate the span program witness size, a property of the input related to $f$. For example, using our techniques, the span program for OR, which can be used to design an optimal algorithm for the OR function, can also be used to design optimal algorithms for: threshold functions, in which we want to decide if the Hamming weight of a string is above a threshold or far below, given the promise that one of these is true; and approximate counting, in which we want to estimate the Hamming weight of the input. We achieve these results by relaxing the requirement that 1-inputs hit some target exactly in the span program, which could make design of span programs easier. We also give an exposition of span program structure, which increases the understanding of this important model. One implication is alternative algorithms for estimating the witness size when the phase gap of a certain unitary can be lower bounded. We show how to lower bound this phase gap in some cases. As applications, we give the first upper bounds in the adjacency query model on the quantum time complexity of estimating the effective resistance between $s$ and $t$, $R_{s,t}(G)$, of $\tilde O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{3/2}}n\sqrt{R_{s,t}(G)})$, and, when $\mu$ is a lower bound on $\lambda_2(G)$, by our phase gap lower bound, we can obtain $\tilde O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}n\sqrt{R_{s,t}(G)/\mu})$, both using $O(\log n)$ space.

abstract: In bipartite quantum systems commutation relations between the Hamiltonian of each subsystem and the interaction impose fundamental constraints on the dynamics of each partition. Here we investigate work, heat and entropy production in bipartite systems characterized by particular commutators between their local Hamiltonians and the interaction operator. We consider the formalism of [Weimer, EPL, 83:30008, 2008], in which heat (work) is identified with energy changes that (do not) alter the local von Neumann entropy, as observed in an effective local measurement basis. We demonstrate the consequences of the commutation relations on the work and heat fluxes into each partition, and extend the formalism to open quantum systems where one, or both, partitions are subject to a Markovian thermal bath. We also discuss the relation between heat and entropy in bipartite quantum systems out of thermal equilibrium, and reconcile the aforementioned approach with the second law of thermodynamics.

The presence of entanglement in the initial state can modify this behavior, enhancing and accelerating the growth of correlations. In this paper we give a quantitative description, in the form of Lieb-Robinson-type bounds on equal-time correlation functions, of the interplay of dynamics vs. initial entanglement in quantum lattice models out of equilibrium. We test the bounds against model calculations, and also discuss applications to quantum quenches, quantum channels, and Kondo physics.

abstract: We develop a thermodynamical theory to describe the behavior of the entanglement between a single two-level atom with a single mode of the electromagnetic field. The resonant Jaynes-Cummings model is used to study both the entanglement thermodynamics, in particular the entanglement temperature, and its connection with the average number of photons in the optical cavity. We find that this entanglement temperature has a strong dependence with the initial conditions of the atom. We show that the entanglement temperature between the photons and the atom defined in this work is the same temperature obtained within the Jaynes-Cummings model at finite temperature developed in the Thermo-Field Dynamics formalism.

abstract: Anonymous Veto (AV) and Dining cryptographers (DC) are two basic primitives for the cryptographic problems that can hide the identity of the sender(s) of classical information. They can be achieved by classical methods and the security is based on computational hardness or requires pairwise shared private keys. In this regard, we present a secure quantum protocol for both DC and AV problems by exploiting the GHZ correlation. We first solve a generalized version of the DC problem with the help of multiparty GHZ state. This allow us to provide a secure quantum protocol for the AV problem. Security of both the protocols rely on some novel and fundamental features of the GHZ correlation known as GHZ paradox.

abstract: A new non-Hermitian E2-quasi-exactly solvable model is constructed containing two previously known models of this type as limits in one of its three parameters. We identify the optimal finite approximation to the double scaling limit to the complex Mathieu Hamiltonian. A detailed analysis of the vicinity of the exceptional points in the parameter space is provided by discussing the branch cut structures responsible for the chirality when exceptional points are surrounded and the structure of the corresponding energy eigenvalue loops stretching over several Riemann sheets. We compute the Stieltjes measure and momentum functionals for the coefficient functions that are univariate weakly orthogonal polynomials in the energy obeying three-term recurrence relations.

abstract: We have unveiled coherent multiphoton interferences originating from different quantum paths taken by the Auger electron induced by a high-intensity x-ray/XUV pulse under the presence of a strong optical field. These interferences give rise to a clear signature in the angle-resolved Auger electron spectrum: an asymmetry with respect to the energy of the Auger decay channel. In order to illustrate this effect we have considered the resonant Auger decay of the transition $2p^{5} \!\leftrightarrow\! 1s^{-1}2p^{6}$ in Ne$^{+}$. The simulations show that these interferences are very sensitive to the parameters of the x-ray and optical fields.

These attacks outperform current strategies based on port-based teleportation for a large class of practical protocols. We then introduce the Interleaved Product protocol, a new scheme for position verification involving only the preparation and measurement of single-qubit states for which the best available attacks have a complexity exponential in the number of classical bits transmitted.

abstract: We inverse engineer realizable time-dependent semiclassical pulses to invert or manipulate a two- level system faster than adiabatically when the rotating-wave approximation cannot be applied. Different inversion routes, based on a counterdiabatic approach or invariants, lead quite generally to singular fields. Making use of the relation between the invariants of motion and the Hamiltonian, and canceling the troublesome singularities, an inversion scheme is put forward for the regime in which the pulse spans few oscillations. For many oscillations an alternative numerical minimization method is proposed and demonstrated.

abstract: The independence of the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift on particle velocity is one of its defining properties. The classical counterpart to this dispersionless behavior is the absence of forces along the direction of motion of the particle. A reevaluation of the experimental demonstration that forces are absent in the AB physical system is given, including previously unpublished data. It is shown that the debate on the presence or absence of forces is not settled, and an experiment searching for dispersionless forces is proposed.

comments: 
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.00715
abstract: In this article we propose a stroboscopic approach to complex vector reconstruction in the context of quantum tomography. There are two underlying assumptions behind our reasoning. The first one claims that the evolution of a d-level pure quantum system is given by the Schr\"odinger equation with a time-independent Hamiltonian and the other states that the knowledge about the quantum state is provided from projective measurements, also called intensity measurements. The problem of quantum state reconstruction is connected with the notion known as phase retrieval - recovering a complex vector from modulus of inner product with frame vectors. We believe that the stroboscopic approach can significantly improve the effectiveness of the vector reconstruction as it aims to decrease the number of distinct projectors by taking advantage of the knowledge about the evolution. General conditions and observations are applied to a specific unitary model.

abstract: We show that a quantum-limited phase-preserving amplifier can act as a which-path information eraser when followed by detection of both quadratures. This beam splitter with gain implements a continuous joint measurement on the signal sources. As an application, we propose heralded remote entanglement generation between two qubits coupled dispersively to separate cavities. Dissimilar qubit-cavity pairs can be made indistinguishable by simple engineering of the cavity driving fields providing experimental flexibility and the prospect for scalability. Additionally, we find an analytic solution for the stochastic master equation, a quantum filter, yielding a thorough physical understanding of the nonlinear measurement process leading to an entangled state of the qubits.

We consider qubit Hamiltonians for which we have an upper bound on the number of terms in which each qubit participates, and find asymptotically optimal bounds for the operator norm and ground-state energy of such Hamiltonians under this constraint. In each case the bound is achieved by a product state which can be found efficiently using a classical algorithm.

abstract: The Berry phase has found applications in building topological order parameters for certain condensed matter systems. The question whether some geometric phase for mixed states can serve the same purpose has been raised, and proposals are on the table. We analyze the intricate behaviour of Uhlmann's geometric phase in the Kitaev chain at finite temperature, and then argue that it captures quite different physics from that intended. We also analyze the behaviour of a geometric phase introduced in the context of interferometry. For the Kitaev chain, this phase closely mirrors that of the Berry phase, and we argue that it merits further investigation.

abstract: Holonomic quantum computation (HQC) may not show its full potential in quantum speedup due to the prerequisite of a long coherent runtime imposed by the adiabatic condition. Here we show that the conventional HQC can be dramatically accelerated by using external control fields, of which the effectiveness is exclusively determined by the integral of the control fields in the time domain. This control scheme is fault tolerant against fluctuation and noise, significantly relaxing the experimental constraints. We demonstrate how to realize the scheme via decoherence-free subspaces. In this way we unify quantum robustness merits of this fault tolerant control scheme, the conventional HQC and decoherence-free subspace, and propose an {\em expedited} holonomic quantum computation protocol.

abstract: Relying on an exact time evolution scheme, we identify a novel transient energy transfer phe- nomenon in an exactly-solvable quantum microscopic model consisting of a three-level system coupled to two non-Markovian zero-temperature bosonic baths through two separable quantum channels. The dynamics of this model can be solved exactly using the quantum-state-diffusion equation formalism, demonstrating finite intervals of unidirectional energy flow across the system, typically, from the non-Markovian environment towards the more Markovian bath. Furthermore, when introducing a spatial asymmetry into the system, an analogue of the rectification effect is realized. In the long time limit, the dynamics arrives at a stationary state and the effects recede. Understanding temporal characteristics of directional energy flow will aid in designing microscopic energy transfer devices.

abstract: Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in an asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler are studied. The asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler is composed of a linear waveguide ($\chi^{\left(1\right)}$) and a nonlinear waveguide ($\chi^{\left(2\right)}$) interacting with each other through the evanescent waves. The nonlinear waveguide has quadratic nonlinearity and it operates under second harmonic generation. A completely quantum mechanical description is used to describe the system. The closed form analytic solutions of Heisenberg's equations of motion for the different field modes are obtained using Sen-Mandal perturbative approach. In the coupler, the linear waveguide acts as a probe on the system (nonlinear waveguide). The effect of the presence of the probe (linear waveguide) on the photon statistics of the second harmonic mode of the system is considered as quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects. Further,it is also shown that in the stimulated case, it is easy to switch between quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects just by controlling the phase of the second harmonic mode of the asymmetric coupler

abstract: Most studies for postselected weak measurement focus on using pure Gaussian state as a pointer, which can only give an amplification limit reaching the ground state fluctuation. In this paper we use the thermal state pointer. We find that its amplification limit can reach thermal fluctuations and we also give the amplification mechanism different from the one with pure Gaussian state pointer. To illustrate the results, we propose two schemes to implement room temperature amplification of the mechanical oscillator's displacement caused by one photon in optomechanical system. The two schemes can both enhance the original displacement by nearly seven orders of magnitude, attaining sensitivity to displacements of ~ 0.26 nm. Such amplification effect can be used to observe the impact of a single photon on a room temperature mechanical oscillator which is impossible to detect in traditional measurement.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Information Theory (cs.IT); Mathematical Physics (math-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.00903
abstract: We analyse quantum state tomography in scenarios where measurements and states are both constrained. States are assumed to live in a semi-algebraic subset of state space and measurements are supposed to be rank-one POVMs, possibly with additional constraints. Specifically, we consider sets of von Neumann measurements and sets of local observables. We provide upper bounds on the minimal number of measurement settings or outcomes that are required for discriminating all states within the given set. The bounds exploit tools from real algebraic geometry and lead to generic results that do not only show the existence of good measurements but guarantee that almost all measurements with the same dimension characteristic perform equally well. In particular, we show that on an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space any two states of a semi-algebraic subset can be discriminated by $k$ generic von Neumann measurements if $k(n-1)$ is larger than twice the dimension of the subset. In case the subset is given by states of rank at most $r$, we show that $k$ generic von Neumann measurements suffice to discriminate any two states provided that $k(n-1)>4r(n-r)-2$. Furthermore, we obtain corresponding results for low-rank matrix recovery of hermitian matrices and the phase retrieval problem.

abstract: A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is an unusual localized state that is embedded in a continuum of extended states. Here, we present the general condition for BICs to arise from wave equation separability and show that the directionality and dimensionality of their resonant radiation can be controlled by exploiting perturbations of certain symmetry. Using this general framework, we construct new examples of separable BICs in realistic models of optical potentials for ultracold atoms, photonic systems, and systems described by tight binding. Such BICs with easily reconfigurable radiation patterns allow for applications such as the storage and release of waves at a controllable rate and direction, systems that switch between different dimensions of confinement, and experimental realizations in atomic, optical, and electronic systems.

abstract: This review paper is intended for scholars with different backgrounds, possibly in only one of the subjects covered, and therefore little background knowledge is assumed. The first part is an introduction to classical and quantum information theory (CIT, QIT): basic definitions and tools of CIT are introduced, such as the information content of a random variable, the typical set, and some principles of data compression. Some concepts and results of QIT are then introduced, such as the qubit, the pure and mixed states, the Holevo theorem, the no-cloning theorem, and the quantum complementarity. In the second part, two applications of QIT to open problems in theoretical physics are discussed. The black hole (BH) information paradox is related to the phenomenon of the Hawking radiation (HR). Consid- ering a BH starting in a pure state, after its complete evaporation only the Hawking radiation will remain, which is shown to be in a mixed state. This either describes a non-unitary evolution of an isolated system, contradicting the evolution postulate of quantum mechanics and violating the no-cloning theorem, or it implies that the initial information content can escape the BH, therefore contradicting general relativity. The progress toward the solution of the paradox is discussed. The renormalization group (RG) aims at the extraction of the macroscopic description of a physical system from its microscopic description. This passage from microscopic to macroscopic can be described in terms of several steps from one scale to another, and is therefore formalized as the action of a group. The c-theorem proves the existence, under certain conditions, of a function which is monotonically decreasing along the group transformations. This result suggests an interpretation of this function as entropy, and its use to study the information flow along the RG transformations.

abstract: Quantum light-matter interfaces (QLMIs) connecting stationary qubits to photons will enable optical networks for quantum communications, precise global time keeping, photon switching, and studies of fundamental physics. Rare-earth-ion (REI) doped crystals are state-of-the-art materials for optical quantum memories and quantum transducers between optical photons, microwave photons and spin waves. Here we demonstrate coupling of an ensemble of neodymium REIs to photonic nano-cavities fabricated in the yttrium orthosilicate host crystal. Cavity quantum electrodynamics effects including Purcell enhancement (F=42) and dipole-induced transparency are observed on the highly coherent 4I9/2-4F3/2 optical transition. Fluctuations in the cavity transmission due to statistical fine structure of the atomic density are measured, indicating operation at the quantum level. Coherent optical control of cavity-coupled REIs is performed via photon echoes. Long optical coherence times (T2~100 microseconds) and small inhomogeneous broadening are measured for the cavity-coupled REIs, thus demonstrating their potential for on-chip scalable QLMIs.

abstract: The change in the decay rate of an excited atom that is brought about by extinction and thermal-radiation effects in a nearby dielectric medium is determined from a quantummechanical model. The medium is a collection of randomly distributed thermally-excited spherical scatterers with absorptive properties. The modification of the decay rate is described by a set of correction functions for which analytical expressions are obtained as sums over contributions from the multipole moments of the scatterers. The results for the modified decay rate as a function of the distance between the excited atom and the dielectric medium show the influence of absorption, scattering and thermal-radiation processes. Some of these processes are found to be mutually counteractive. The changes in the decay rate are compared to those following from an effective-medium theory in which the discrete scatterers are replaced by a continuum.

abstract: Most continuous-variable quantum key distribution schemes are based on the Gaussian modulation of coherent states followed by continuous quadrature detection using homodyne detectors. In all previous schemes, the Gaussian modulation has been carried out in conjugate quadratures thus requiring two independent modulators for their implementations. Here, we propose and experimentally test a largely simplified scheme in which the Gaussian modulation is performed in a single quadrature. The scheme is shown to be asymptotically secure against collective attacks. A single-quadrature modulation approach renders the need for a costly amplitude modulator unnecessary, and thus facilitates commercialization of continuous-variable quantum key distribution.

abstract: This paper defines what constitutes the Observed World in the Quantum Mechanical framework, based strictly on what is actually observed beyond doubt, instead of building observables on what is inferred from actual observations. Such principle narrows down considerably what can be considered as being part of the Observed World. On the other hand, we argue that some information - that is in general assumed as granted - should actually be considered as being part of the Observed World. We discuss the implications of such assertion, in the way we perceive time evolution, information growth and causality.

abstract: Statistical fluctuation problems are faced by all quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols under finite-key condition. Most of the current statistical fluctuation analysis methods work based on independent random samples, however, the precondition cannot be always satisfied on account of different choice of samples and actual parameters. As a result, proper statistical fluctuation methods are required to figure out this problem. Taking the after-pulse contributions into consideration, we give the expression of secure key rate and the mathematical model for statistical fluctuations, focusing on a decoy-state QKD protocol (Sci Rep. 3, 2453, 2013) with biased basis choice. On this basis, a classified analysis of statistical fluctuation is represented according to the mutual relationship between random samples. First for independent identical relations, we make a deviation comparison between law of large numbers and standard error analysis. Secondly, we give a sufficient condition that Chernoff bound achieves a better result than Hoeffding's inequality based on independent relations only. Thirdly, by constructing the proper martingale, for the first time we represent a stringent way to deal with statistical fluctuation issues upon dependent ones through making use of Azuma's inequality. In numerical optimization, we show the impact on secure key rate, the ones and respective deviations under various kinds of statistical fluctuation analyses.

abstract: We explore bounds of {\em time-space tradeoffs} in language recognition on two-way finite automata for some special languages. We prove: (1) a time-space tradeoff upper bound for recognition of the languages $L_{EQ}(n)$ on {\em two-way probabilistic finite automata} (2PFA): $TS={\bf O}(n\log n)$, whereas a time-space tradeoff lower bound on {\em two-way deterministic finite automata} is ${\bf \Omega}(n^2)$; (2) a time-space tradeoff upper bound for recognition of the languages $L_{INT}(n)$ on {\em two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states} (2QCFA): $TS={\bf O}(n^{3/2}\log n)$, whereas a lower bound on 2PFA is $TS={\bf \Omega}(n^2)$; (3) a time-space tradeoff upper bound for recognition of the languages $L_{NE}(n)$ on exact 2QCFA: $TS={\bf O}(n^{1.87} \log n)$, whereas a lower bound on 2PFA is $TS={\bf \Omega}(n^2)$. It has been proved (Klauck, STOC'00) that the exact one-way quantum finite automata have no advantage comparing to classical finite automata in recognizing languages. However, the result (3) shows that the exact 2QCFA do have an advantage in comparison with their classical counterparts, which has been the first example showing that the exact quantum computing have advantage in time-space tradeoff comparing to classical computing. Usually, two communicating parties, Alice and Bob, are supposed to have an access to arbitrary computational power in {\em communication complexity} model that is used. Instead of that we will consider communication complexity in such a setting that two parties are using only finite automata and we prove in this setting that quantum automata are better than classical automata and also probabilistic automata are better than deterministic automata for some well known tasks.

abstract: Recently, a broadcasting multiple blind signature scheme based on quantum teleportation has been proposed for the ?rst time. It is claimed to have unconditional security and properties of quantum multiple signature and quantum blind signature. In this paper, we analyze the security of the protocol and show that the signatory Ui can learn the signed message m by a single particle measurement and the signed message m can be modi?ed at random by anyone according to the scheme. Furthermore, there are some participant attacks and external attacks existing in the scheme. Finally we present an improved protocol and show that the improved scheme can resist all of the mentioned attacks. Meanwhile, the secret keys can be used again and again, which will make it more e?cient and practical.

abstract: The direction of the steady-state heat currents across a generic quantum system connected to multiple baths may be engineered so as to realize virtually any thermodynamic cycle. In spite of their versatility such continuous energy-conversion systems are generally unable to operate at maximum efficiency due to non-negligible sources of irreversible entropy production. In this paper we introduce a minimal model of irreversible absorption chiller. We identify and characterize the different mechanisms responsible for its irreversibility, namely heat leaks and internal dissipation, and gauge their relative impact in the overall cooling performance. We also propose reservoir engineering techniques to minimize these detrimental effects. Finally, by looking into a known three-qubit embodiment of the absorption cooling cycle, we illustrate how our simple model may help to pinpoint the different sources of irreversibility naturally arising in more complex practical heat devices.

abstract: Existing experimental implementations of continuous-variable quantum key distribution require shot-noise limited operation, achieved with shot-noise limited lasers. However, loosening this requirement on the laser source would allow for cheaper, potentially integrated systems. Here, we implement a theoretically proposed prepare-and-measure continuous-variable protocol and experimentally demonstrate the robustness of it against preparation noise stemming for instance from technical laser noise. Provided that direct reconciliation techniques are used in the post-processing we show that for small distances large amounts of preparation noise can be tolerated in contrast to reverse reconciliation where the key rate quickly drops to zero. Our experiment thereby demonstrates that quantum key distribution with non-shot-noise limited laser diodes might be feasible.

abstract: We demonstrate how the physics of multiboson correlation interference leads to the computational complexity of linear optics interferometers based on correlation measurements in the inner degrees of freedom of the input bosons. In particular, we address the task of MultiBoson Correlation Sampling (MBCS) from the probability distribution associated with polarization- and time-resolved detections at the output of random linear optical networks. We show that the MBCS problem is hard to solve classically even for input photons of different colors. These results manifest the quantum computational supremacy inherent to the fundamental nature of quantum interference.

abstract: We investigate the thermal Casimir force between two parallel plates made of different isotropic materials which are separated by a uniaxial anisotropic film. Numerical computations of the Casimir pressure at T=300K are performed using the complete Lifshitz formula adapted for an anisotropic intervening layer and in the nonrelativistic limit. It is shown that the standard (nonrelativistic) theory of the van der Waals force is not applicable in this case, because the effects of retardation contribute significantly even for film thicknesses of a few nanometers. We have also obtained simple analytic expressions for the classical Casimir free energy and pressure for large film thicknesses (high temperatures). Unlike the case of isotropic intervening films, for two metallic plates the classical Casimir free energy and pressure are shown to depend on the static dielectric permittivities of an anisotropic film. One further interesting feature is that the classical limit is achieved at much shorter separations between the plates than for a vacuum gap. Possible applications of the obtained results are discussed.

abstract: In 1964, John Bell proved that quantum mechanics is "unreasonable" (to use Einstein's term): there are nonlocal bipartite quantum correlations. But they are not the most nonlocal bipartite correlations consistent with relativistic causality ("no superluminal signalling"): also maximally nonlocal "superquantum" (or "PR-box") correlations are consistent with relativistic causality. I show that---unlike quantum correlations---these correlations do not have a classical limit consistent with relativistic causality. The generalization of this result to all stronger-than-quantum nonlocal correlations is a derivation of Tsirelson's bound---a theorem of quantum mechanics---from the three axioms of relativistic causality, nonlocality, and the existence of a classical limit. But is it reasonable to derive (a part of) quantum mechanics from the unreasonable axiom of nonlocality?! I consider replacing the nonlocality axiom with an equivalent axiom that even Bell and Einstein might have considered reasonable: an axiom of local retrocausality.

abstract: Entanglement is a key ingredient for quantum technologies and a fundamental signature of quantumness in a broad range of phenomena encompassing many-body physics, thermodynamics, cosmology, and life sciences. For arbitrary multiparticle systems, the quantification of entanglement typically involves hard optimisation problems, and requires demanding tomographical techniques. In this paper we show that such difficulties can be overcome by developing an experimentally friendly method to evaluate measures of multiparticle entanglement via a geometric approach. The method provides exact analytical results for a relevant class of mixed states of $N$ qubits, and computable lower bounds to entanglement for any general state. For practical purposes, the entanglement determination requires local measurements in just three settings for any $N$. We demonstrate the power of our approach to quantify multiparticle entanglement in $N$-qubit bound entangled states and other states recently engineered in laboratory using quantum optics and trapped ion setups.

abstract: Cryptographic protocols, such as protocols for secure function evaluation (SFE), have played a crucial role in the development of modern cryptography. The extensive theory of these protocols, however, deals almost exclusively with classical attackers. If we accept that quantum information processing is the most realistic model of physically feasible computation, then we must ask: what classical protocols remain secure against quantum attackers? Our main contribution is showing the existence of classical two-party protocols for the secure evaluation of any polynomial-time function under reasonable computational assumptions (for example, it suffices that the learning with errors problem be hard for quantum polynomial time). Our result shows that the basic two-party feasibility picture from classical cryptography remains unchanged in a quantum world.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: For commuting operations, multiple data values exist simultaneously in quantum mechanics. For non-commuting operations data are conditional on prior outcomes, or they may be predicted as alternative outcomes of the non-commuting operations. The classical situation is similar, even though the fact of non-commutation is not recognized in an overarching formalism as it is in quantum mechanics. Given the qualitative differences, there would seem to be no a priori reason why correlation functions among commuting variables should be the same as those among non-commuting variables as Bell assumed. When data for commuting and non-commuting operations are explicitly computed quantum mechanically for the Bell case, the correlations are different, and they satisfy the Bell inequality.

abstract: Standard heat machines (engine, heat pump, refrigerator) are composed of a system ("working fluid") coupled to at least two equilibrium baths at different temperatures and periodically driven by an external device (piston or rotor) called sometimes work reservoir. The aim of this paper is to go beyond this scheme by considering environments which are stationary but cannot be decomposed into few baths at thermal equilibrium. Such situations are important, for example in solar cells, chemical machines in biology, various realizations of laser cooling or nanoscopic machines driven by laser radiation. We classify non-equilibrium baths depending on their thermodynamic behavior and show that the efficiency of heat machines operating under their influences is limited by a generalized Carnot bound.

abstract: As a result of the quantum, wave-like nature of the physical world, a harmonic oscillator can never be completely at rest. Even in the quantum ground state, its position will always have fluctuations, called the zero-point motion. Although the zero-point fluctuations are unavoidable, they can be manipulated. In this work, using microwave frequency radiation pressure, we both prepare a micron-scale mechanical system in a state near the quantum ground state and then manipulate its thermal fluctuations to produce a stationary, quadrature-squeezed state. We deduce that the variance of one motional quadrature is 0.80 times the zero-point level, or 1 dB of sub-zero-point squeezing. This work is relevant to the quantum engineering of states of matter at large length scales, the study of decoherence of large quantum systems, and for the realization of ultra-sensitive sensing of force and motion.

abstract: Classical correlations without predefined causal order arise from processes where parties manipulate random variables, and where the order of these interactions is not predefined. No assumption on the causal order of the parties is made, but the processes are restricted to be logically consistent under any choice of the parties' operations. It is known that for three parties or more, this set of processes is larger than the set of processes achievable in a predefined ordering of the parties. Here, we model all classical processes without predefined causal order geometrically and find that the set of such processes forms a polytope. Additionally, we model a smaller polytope --- the deterministic-extrema polytope --- where all extremal points represent deterministic processes. This polytope excludes probabilistic processes that must be --- quite unnaturally --- fine-tuned, because any variation of the weights in a decomposition into deterministic processes leads to a logical inconsistency.

abstract: The generation of quantum entanglement of macroscopic or mesoscopic bodies in mechanical systems is generally bounded by the thermal fluctuation exerted by their environments. Here we propose a scheme to establish stationary entanglement between two mechanically oscillating mirrors of a cavity. It is revealed that, by applying a broadband squeezed laser acting as a squeezed-vacuum reservoir to the cavity, a stable entanglement between the mechanical oscillators can be generated. Using the adiabatic elimination and master equation methods, we analytically find that the generated entanglement is essentially determined by the squeezing of the relative momentum of the mechanical oscillators, which is transferred from the squeezed reservoir through the cavity. Numerical verification indicates that our scheme is within the present experimental state of the art of optomachanics.

abstract: We prove an extended continuity property for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), which are general and apply to any case whether associated metrology is closed-system or open system. These properties imply that the QFI and the SLD do not seem to be continuous functions of density matrices; they, however, have this property that for two close density matrices with close first derivatives both the QFIs and the SLDs would be respectively close too. In some special cases these properties reduce to continuity. As an interesting and important result, we establish a bound on the QFI of a quantum state in terms of its manybody entanglement measured by the geometric measure of entanglement. We show that, under some conditions, nonvanishing entanglement seems necessary for a quantum metrology scenario to exhibit quantum-enhanced regime of accuracy. Interestingly, most quantum states chosen randomly from Hilbert space of a manybody system of identical probe systems appear to be sufficiently good to feature such enhanced metrology.

abstract: Quantum Mechanics (QM) predicts that the correlation between measurements performed in remote regions of a spatially spread entangled state is higher than allowed by the intuitive concepts of Locality and Realism (LR). This high correlation forbids the introduction of nonlinear operators of evolution in QM (which would be desirable for several reasons), for it would lead to faster-than-light signaling. As a way out of this situation, it has been hypothesized that the high quantum correlation can be observed only after a time longer than L/c has elapsed (where L is the spatial spread of the entangled state and c is the speed of light). In shorter times, a correlation compatible with LR would be observed instead. A simple model following this hypothesis is described. It has not been disproved by any of the performed experiments to date, but a test that can be achieved with accessible means is proposed. The data recorded in a similar but incomplete experiment (which was done in 2012 with a different purpose) are analyzed, and are found consistent with the described model. Yet, we stress that a specific experiment is absolutely needed.

abstract: Many phenomena in solid-state physics can be understood in terms of their topological properties. Recently, controlled protocols of quantum walks are proving to be effective simulators of such phenomena. Here we report the realization of a photonic quantum walk showing both the trivial and the non-trivial topologies associated with chiral symmetry in one-dimensional periodic systems, as in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model of polyacetylene. We find that the probability distribution moments of the walker position after many steps behave differently in the two topological phases and can be used as direct indicators of the quantum transition: while varying a control parameter, these moments exhibit a slope discontinuity at the transition point, and remain constant in the non-trivial phase. Extending this approach to higher dimensions, different topological classes, and other typologies of quantum phases may offer new general instruments for investigating quantum transitions in such complex systems.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-mode laser system by extending the two-mode Tavis-Cummings model with dissipative channels and incoherent pumping and by applying the mean-field approximation in the thermodynamic limit. To this end we analytically calculate up to four possible non-equilibrium steady states (fixed points) and determine the corresponding complex phase diagram. Various possible phases are distinguished by the actual number of fixed points and their stability. In addition, we apply three time-delayed Pyragas feedback control schemes. Depending on the time delay and the strength of the control term this can lead to the stabilization of unstable fixed points or to the selection of a particular cavity mode that is macroscopically occupied.

abstract: Time-bin entangled photons are ideal for long-distance quantum communication via optical fibers. Here we present a source where, even at high creation rates, each excitation pulse generates at most one time-bin entangled pair. This is important for the accuracy and security of quantum communication. Our site-controlled quantum dot generates single polarization-entangled photon pairs, which are then converted, without loss of entanglement strength, into single time-bin entangled photon pairs.

Lastly, we present some useful quantum program analysis scenarios and discuss their implications, specifically with an elaborate discussion of timing analysis for critical path estimation. Our work focuses on bridging the gap between high-level quantum algorithm specifi- cations and low-level physical implementations, while providing good scalability to larger and more interesting problems

By time-tuning a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer fed with frequency-displaced coherent states, the output photons can be synchronously heralded following sub-Poisson statistics, which is indicated by the second-order correlation function ($g^2\left(0\right)=0.556$). When compared to state-of-the-art asynchronous spontaneous parametric down-conversion-based sources, the technique presents comparable yield and at least one order of magnitude higher coherence time.

abstract: The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) is the phenomenon where the unitary evolution of a quantum state is suppressed e.g. due to frequent measurements. Here, we investigate the use of the QZE in a class of communication complexity problems (CCPs). Quantum entanglement is known to solve certain CCPs beyond classical constraints. However, recent developments have yielded CCPs where super-classical results can be obtained using only communication of a single d-level quantum state (qudit) as a resource. In the class of CCPs considered here, we show quantum reduction of complexity in three ways: using i) entanglement and the QZE, ii) single qudit and the QZE, iii) single qudit. The final protocol is motivated by experimental feasibility, and we have performed a proof of concept experimental demonstration.

Our result can be used to extend the study of continuous-variable protocols, such as quantum teleportation and cloning, beyond the current one-mode or two-mode analyses, and paves the way to solve general problems in quantum metrology and quantum hypothesis testing with arbitrary multimode Gaussian resources.

abstract: In general relativity, the picture of spacetime assigns an ideal clock to each spacetime point. Being ideal, gravitational effects due to these clocks are ignored and the flow of time according to one clock is not affected by the presence of surrounding clocks. However, if time is defined operationally, as a pointer position of a physical clock that obeys the laws of quantum mechanics and general relativity, such a picture is at most a convenient fiction. We show that the mass-energy equivalence implies gravitational interaction between the clocks, while the superposition of energy eigenstates leads to a non-fixed metric background. Based only on the assumption that both quantum mechanics and general relativity are valid in this situation, we show that the clocks necessarily get entangled through time dilation effect, which eventually leads to a loss of coherence of a single clock. Hence, the time as measured by a single clock is not well-defined. However, the general relativistic notion of time is recovered in the classical limit of clocks.

abstract: We present a method for quantum entanglement distribution over a so-called code-division-multiple-access network, in which two pairs of users share the same quantum channel to transmit information. The main idea of this method is to use different broad-band chaotic phase shifts, generated by electro-optic modulators (EOMs) and chaotic Colpitts circuits, to encode the information-bearing quantum signals coming from different users, and then recover the masked quantum signals at the receiver side by imposing opposite chaotic phase shifts. The chaotic phase shifts given to different pairs of users are almost uncorrelated due to the randomness of chaos and thus the quantum signals from different pair of users can be distinguished even when they are sent via the same quantum channel. It is shown that two maximally-entangled states can be generated between two pairs of users by our method mediated by bright coherent lights, which can be more easily implemented in experiments compared with single-photon lights. Our method is robust under the channel noises if only the decay rates of the information-bearing fields induced by the channel noises are not quite high. Our study opens up new perspectives for addressing and transmitting quantum information in future quantum networks.

abstract: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was originally posed for the limit of the accuracy of simultaneous measurement of non-commuting observables as stating that canonically conjugate observables can be measured simultaneously only with the constraint that the product of their mean errors should be no less than a limit set by Planck's constant. However, Heisenberg with the subsequent completion by Kennard has long been credited only with a constraint for state preparation represented by the product of the standard deviations. Here, we show that Heisenberg actually proved the constraint for the accuracy of simultaneous measurement but assuming an obsolete postulate for quantum mechanics. This assumption, known as the repeatability hypothesis, formulated explicitly by von Neumann and Schr\"{o}dinger, was broadly accepted until the 1970s, but abandoned in the 1980s, when completely general quantum measurement theory was established. We also survey the author's recent proposal for a universally valid reformulation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle under the most general assumption on quantum measurement.

abstract: We investigate the feasibility of precision frequency metrology with large ion crystals. For clock candidates with a negative differential static polarisability, we show that micromotion effects should not impede the performance of the clock. Using Lu+ as a specific example, we show that quadrupole shifts due to the electric fields from neighbouring ions do not significantly affect clock performance. We also show that effects from the tensor polarisability can be effectively managed with a compensation laser at least for a small number of ions (<1000). These results provide new possibilities for ion-based atomic clocks, allowing them to achieve stability levels comparable to neutral atoms in optical lattices and a viable path to greater levels of accuracy.

abstract: We present a simple and robust construction of a real-time quantum random number generator (QRNG). Our minimalist approach ensures stable operation of the device as well as its simple and straightforward hardware implementation as a stand-alone module. As a source of randomness the device uses measurements of time intervals between clicks of a single-photon detector. The obtained raw sequence is then filtered and processed by a deterministic randomness extractor, which is realized as a look-up table. This enables high speed on-the-fly processing without the need of extensive computations. The overall performance of the device is around 1 random bit per detector click, resulting in 1.2 Mbit/s generation rate in our implementation.

abstract: We outline a general perturbative method of evaluating scattering features of finite-range complex potentials and use it to examine complex perturbations of a rectangular barrier potential. In optics, these correspond to modulated refractive index profiles of the form $n(x)=n_0+f(x)$, where $n_0$ is real, $f(x)$ is complex-valued, and $|f(x)|\ll1\leq n_0$. We give a comprehensive description of the phenomenon of unidirectional invisibility for such media, proving five general theorems on its realization in ${\cal PT}$-symmetric and non-${\cal PT}$-symmetric material. In particular, we establish the impossibility of unidirectional invisibility for ${\cal PT}$-symmetric samples whose refractive index has a constant real part and show how a simple scaling transformation of a unidirectionally invisible ${\cal PT}$-symmetric index profile with $n_0=1$ may be used to generate a hierarchy of unidirectionally invisible ${\cal PT}$-symmetric index profiles with $n_0>1$. The results pertaining unidirectional invisibility for $n_0>1$ open up the way for the experimental studies of this phenomenon in a variety of active material. As an application of our general results, we show that a medium with $n(x)=n_0+\zeta e^{iK x}$, $\zeta$ and $K$ real, and $|\zeta|\ll 1$ can support unidirectional invisibility only for $n_0=1$. We then construct unidirectionally invisible index profiles of the form $n(x)=n_0+\sum_\ell z_\ell e^{iK_\ell x}$, with $z_\ell$ complex, $K_\ell$ real, $|z_\ell|\ll 1$, and $n_0>1$.

abstract: In this paper, I argue that photons do not exist as physical objects and that light is a continuous classical electromagnetic wave, while the observed so-called quantum nature of the interaction of light with matter is connected to the discrete (atomic) structure of matter and to the specific nature of the light-atom interaction. From this point of view, the Born rule for light is derived, and the double-slit experiment is analysed in detail. I show that the double-slit experiment can be explained without using the concept of a "photon", solely on the basis of classical electrodynamics. I show that within this framework, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for a "photon" has a simple physical meaning not related to the fundamental limitations in accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of position and momentum or time and energy.

title: Invariant Set Theory: Violating Measurement Independence without Fine Tuning, Conspiracy, Constraints on Free Will or Retrocausality

abstract: Invariant Set (IS) theory is a locally causal ontic theory of physics based on the Cosmological Invariant Set postulate that the universe $U$ can be considered a deterministic dynamical system evolving precisely on a (suitably constructed) fractal dynamically invariant set in $U$'s state space. IS theory violates the Bell inequalities by violating Measurement Independence. Despite this, IS theory is not fine tuned, is not conspiratorial, does not constrain experimenter free will and does not invoke retrocausality. The reasons behind these claims are discussed in this paper. These arise from properties not found in conventional ontic models: the invariant set has zero measure in its Euclidean embedding space, has Cantor Set structure homeomorphic to the p-adic integers ($p \ggg 0$) and is non-computable. In particular, it is shown that the p-adic metric encapulates the physics of the Cosmological Invariant Set postulate, and provides the technical means to demonstrate no fine tuning or conspiracy. Quantum theory can be viewed as the singular limit of IS theory when when $p$ is set equal to infinity. Since it is based around a top-down constraint from cosmology, IS theory suggests that gravitational and quantum physics will be unified by a gravitational theory of the quantum, rather than a quantum theory of gravity. Some implications arising from such a perspective are discussed.

abstract: Tomograms are obtained as probability distributions and are used to reconstruct a quantum state from experimentally measured values. We study the evolution of tomograms for different quantum systems, both finite and infinite dimensional. In realistic experimental conditions, the quantum states are exposed to the ambient environment and hence subject to effects like decoherence and dissipation, which are dealt with here, consistently, using the formalism of open quantum systems. This is extremely relevant from the perspective of experimental implementation and issues related to state reconstruction in quantum computation and communication. These considerations are also expected to affect the quasiprobability distribution obtained from experimentally generated tomograms and nonclassicality observed from them.

abstract: We show gapped critical environment could remarkably prevent an enhanced decay of decoherence factor and quantum correlations at the critical point, which is nontrivially different from the ones in a gapless critical environment (Quan, et.al Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{96}, 140604 (2006)). The quantum correlations display very fast decaying to their local minimum at the critical point while maximum decaying occurs away from this point. In particular, our results imply that collapse of decoherence factor is not indicator of a quantum phase transition of environment as opposed to what happens in a gapless criticallity. In the week coupling regime, the relaxation time, at which the quantum correlations touch rapidly local minima, shows a power-law singularity as a function of gap. Furthermore, quantum correlations decay exponentially with second power of relaxation time. Our results are important for a better understanding and characterisation of gap critical environment and its ability as entanglers in open quantum systems.

abstract: If a particular situation is not physically possible, then one has a no-go theorem. For instance, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) theorem serves as such a no-go theorem for nonexistence of local hidden variable models by presenting a full contradiction "1=-1" for the multipartite GHZ states. However, the elegant GHZ argument for Bell's nonlocality is not valid for the bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state. Recent study on quantum nonlocality has shown that the more precise description of EPR's original scenario is "steering", i.e., the nonexistence of local hidden state models. In this work, we present a very simple GHZ-like contradiction "2=1" for any bipartite pure entangled state, thus proving a no-go theorem for nonexistence of local hidden state models in the EPR paradox.

abstract: Four-wave mixing in atomic vapor allows for the generation of multi-spatial-mode states of light containing many pairs of two-mode entangled vacuum beams. This in principle can be used to send independent secure keys to multiple parties simultaneously using a single light source. In our experiment, we demonstrate this spatial multiplexing of information by selecting three independent pairs of entangled modes and performing continuous-variable measurements to verify the correlations between entangled partners. In this way, we generate three independent pairs of correlated random bit streams that could be used as secure keys. We then demonstrate a classical four-party secret sharing scheme as an example for how this spatially multiplexed source could be used.

abstract: Preparation of a non-classically correlated state is the first step of any quantum-enhanced interferometric protocol. An efficient method is the one-axis twisting, which entangles a collection of initially uncorrelated particles by means of two-body interactions. Here we investigate the limits of the quantum improvement which can be reached with this method in realistic experimental conditions. We demonstrate that the usefulness of this entangling mechanism is a result of fine structures introduced into the quantum state. The scale at which these structures vary allows us to identify the minimal requirements for the precision of the complete interferometric sequence. Our results---especially the explanation of the underlying principle of the entangling method---may help to develop ultra-precise interferometers.

Entanglement of the states which belong to this manifold is investigated.

The fitting parameters are compared to the classical optical beat when bright versions of the sources are used. The results show the equivalence between both techniques.

abstract: By means of the divisibility criterion, i.e., the non-positivity of the dynamical matrix for some intermediate time, we characterize the dynamics of a qubit interacting with an arbitrary quadratic fermionic environment. We obtain an analytical expression for the Kraus decomposition of the quantum map, and check its non-positivity with a simple function. With an efficient sufficient criterion to map the non-Markovian regions of the dynamics, we analyze the particular case of an environment described by the Ising Hamiltonian with a transverse field.

abstract: Von Neumann projections are the main operations by which information can be extracted from the quantum to the classical realm. They are however static processes that do not adapt to the states they measure. Advances in the field of adaptive measurement have shown that this limitation can be overcome by "wrapping" the von Neumann projectors in a higher-dimensional circuit which exploits the interplay between measurement outcomes and measurement settings. Unfortunately, the design of adaptive measurement has often been ad hoc and setup-specific. We shall here develop a unified framework for designing optimized measurements. Our approach is two-fold: The first is algebraic and formulates the problem of measurement as a simple matrix diagonalization problem. The second is algorithmic and models the optimal interaction between measurement outcomes and measurement settings as a cascaded network of conditional probabilities. Finally, we demonstrate that several figures of merit, such as Bell factors, can be improved by optimized measurements. This leads us to the promising observation that measurement detectors which---taken individually---have a low quantum efficiency can be be arranged into circuits where, collectively, the limitations of inefficiency are compensated for.

abstract: We introduce the maximal steered coherence for bipartite quantum systems. This is a measure that describes the extent to which quantum steering can remotely create coherence. When Alice and Bob share a composite quantum state $\rho$, a local measurement by Alice can steer Bob's state; our proposed measure, $\mathcal C(\rho)$, is defined as the maximal coherence of Bob's steered state in the eigenbasis of the original reduced state $\rho_B$, where the maximization is taken over all possible positive-operator valued measurements for Alice. We prove that $\mathcal C$ vanishes only for states that are zero quantum discord for Bob ("classical" states). Although $\mathcal C$ is invariant under local unitary operations, a trace-preserving channel performed by Bob can increase $\mathcal C$ when applied to either classical or entangled states. For a two-qubit state, we find that Bob's channel can increase $\mathcal C$ if and only if it is neither unital nor semi-classical, which coincides with the condition for increasing quantum discord. On the one hand, this result relates the increase of discord-like correlations to the power of quantum steering for coherence generation. On the other hand, the proposed quantity $\mathcal C$ is distinct from discord and other existing measures of quantum correlation.

abstract: The studies on quantum open system play key roles not only in fundamental problems in quantum mechanics but also in quantum computing and information processes. Here we propose a scheme to use a one dimensional coupling cavity array (CCA) as an artificial electromagnetic environment of a two-level atom. For a finite length of CCA, we find that after a turning time the population of excited state deviates suddenly from the exponential decay. We show that physically this phenomena corresponds to a transition from a naked atom decay to a dressed state decay. We hope that our finding will promote the studies on quantum system with a finite size environment.

abstract: We review modern achievements and problems in physics of the van der Waals and Casimir forces which arise due to zero-point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field between closely spaced material surfaces. This subject attracted great experimental and theoretical attention during the last few years because the fluctuation-induced forces find a lot of applications in both fundamental physics and nanotechnology. After a short introduction to the subject, we describe main experimental and theoretical results obtained in the field during the last fifteen years. In the following presentation, we discuss some of the recent results by the authors and their collaborators which are of high promise for future developments. Specifically, we consider new features of the Casimir force acting between a gold sphere and an indium tin oxide plate, present the experimental and theoretical results on measuring the Casimir interaction between two gold surfaces by means of dynamic atomic force microscope, and outline first measurements of the Casimir interaction between magnetic surfaces and related theory. Special attention is devoted to the Casimir effect for graphene, which is the prospective material for microelectromechanical devices of next generations.

abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference between independent photon sources (HOMI-IPS) is the fundamental block for quantum information processing, such as quantum gate, Shor's algorithm, Boson sampling, etc. All the previous HOMI-IPS experiments were carried out in time-domain, however, the spectral information during the interference was lost, due to technical difficulties. Here, we investigate the HOMI-IPS in spectral domain using the recently developed fast fiber spectrometer, and demonstrate the spectral distribution during the HOM interference between two heralded single-photon sources, and two thermal sources. This experiment can not only deepen our understanding of HOMI-IPS in the spectral domain, but also be utilized to improve the visibility by post-processing spectral filtering.

Hence present work clearly demonstates that as such we, do not have a general eigenvalue condition in Quantum Physics. Here it is shown that existing all the three eigenvalue conditions namely: Hermiticity, PT symmetry and Pseudo-Hermiticity, are not sufficient enough even to explain the spectra of Harmonic Oscillator under non-Hermitian transformation of momentum, co-ordinate or both, on appearance of complex energy eigenvalues. In fact complex energy eigenvalues become an inherent feature of transformed oscillator, when its frequency of oscillation matches with that of variational based calculation.

abstract: We propose a new dark-state cooling method of trapped ion systems in the Lamb-Dicke limit. With application of microwave dressing the ion, we can obtain two electromagnetically induced transparency structures. The heating effects caused by the carrier and the blue sideband transition vanish due to the EIT effects and the final mean phonon numbers can be much less than the recoil limit. Our scheme is robust to fluctuations of microwave power and laser intensities which provides a broad cooling bandwidth to cool motional modes of a linear ion chain. Moreover, it is more suitable to cool four-level ions on a large-scale ion chip.

abstract: Using random matrices, we study the reduced dynamics of a two level system interacting with a generic environment. In the weak coupling limit, the result can be obtained directly from known results for purity decay, and result in Markovian dynamics. We then focus on the case of strong coupling, when the dynamics is known to be non-Markovian. In this regime, the coupling dominates over the local parts of the Hamiltonian, and thus we treat the latter as a perturbation of the former. With the help of the linear response approximation, this allows us to obtain an analytical description of the reduced dynamics. Finally, we find a transition from non-Markovian to Markovian dynamics at a point where the coupling and the local Hamiltonian are comparable in size.

abstract: For the paradigmatic case of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator we present two measurement-based feedback schemes to control the stability of its fixed point. The first scheme feeds back a Pyragas-like time-delayed reference signal and the second uses a predetermined instead of time-delayed reference signal. We show that both schemes can reverse the effect of the damping by turning the stable fixed point into an unstable one. Finally, by taking the classical limit $\hbar\rightarrow0$ we explicitly distinguish between inherent quantum effects and effects, which would be also present in a classical noisy feedback loop. In particular, we point out that the correct description of a classical particle conditioned on a noisy measurement record is given by a non-linear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation and not a Langevin equation, which has observable consequences on average as soon as feedback is considered.

abstract: We put forward an experimentally feasible scheme for heralded entanglement generation between two distant macroscopic mechanical resonators. The protocol exploits a hybrid quantum device, a qubit interacting with a mechanical resonator as well as a cavity mode, for each party. The cavity modes interfere on a beam-splitter followed by suitable heralding detections which post-select a hybrid entangled state with success probability 1/2. Subsequently, by local measurements on the qubits a mechanical entangled coherent state can be achieved. The mechanical entanglement can be further verified via monitoring the entanglement of the qubit pair. The setup is envisioned as a test bench for sensing gravitational effects on the quantum dynamics of gravitationally coupled massive objects. As a concrete example, we illustrate the implementation of our protocol using the current circuit QED architectures.

We analyze the feasibility of the implementation in realistic circuit quantum electrodynamics setups, where the interactions are either realized via capacitive couplings or mediated by microwave resonators.

abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to transfer polarization from electron spins to nuclear spins. The resulting nuclear polarization enhancement can, in theory, be two or three orders of magnitude depending on the sample. In solid state systems, however, there are competing mechanisms of DNP, which, when occurring simultaneously, reduce the net polarization enhancement of the nuclear spin. We present a simple quantum description of DNP and apply optimal control theory (OCT) with an open quantum system framework to design pulses that select one DNP process and suppress the others. We demonstrate experimentally an order of magnitude improvement in the DNP enhancement using OCT pulses.

abstract: Quantum annealing provides a promising route for the development of quantum optimization devices, but the usefulness of such devices will be limited in part by the range of implementable problems as dictated by hardware constraints. To overcome constraints imposed by restricted connectivity between qubits, a larger set of interactions can be approximated using minor embedding techniques whereby several physical qubits are used to represent a single logical qubit. However, minor embedding introduces new types of errors due to its approximate nature. We introduce and study quantum annealing correction schemes designed to improve the performance of quantum annealers in conjunction with minor embedding, thus leading to a hybrid scheme defined over an encoded graph. We argue that this scheme can be efficiently decoded using an energy minimization technique provided the density of errors does not exceed the per-site percolation threshold of the encoded graph. We test the hybrid scheme using a D-Wave Two processor on problems for which the encoded graph is a 2-level grid and the Ising model is known to be NP-hard. The problems we consider are frustrated Ising model problem instances with "planted" (a priori known) solutions. Applied in conjunction with optimized energy penalties and decoding techniques, we find that this approach enables the quantum annealer to solve minor embedded instances with significantly higher success probability than it would without error correction. Our work demonstrates that quantum annealing correction can and should be used to improve the robustness of quantum annealing not only for natively embeddable problems, but also when minor embedding is used to extend the connectivity of physical devices.

abstract: We study the role that both vacuum fluctuations and vacuum entanglement of a scalar field play in identifying the spacetime topology, which is not prescribed from first principles---neither in general relativity or quantum gravity. We analyze how the entanglement and observable correlations acquired between two particle detectors are sensitive to the spatial topology of spacetime. We examine the detector's time evolution to all orders in perturbation theory and then study the phenomenon of vacuum entanglement harvesting in Minkowski spacetime and two flat topologically distinct spacetimes constructed from identifications of the Minkowski space. We show that, for instance, if the spatial topology induces a preferred direction, this direction may be inferred from the dependence of correlations between the two detectors on their orientation. We therefore show that vacuum fluctuations and vacuum entanglement harvesting makes it, in principle, possible to distinguish spacetimes with identical local geometry that differ only in their topology.

abstract: In [7] the authors of this paper argued in favor of the possibility to consider a Paraconsistent Approach to Quantum Superpositions (PAQS). We claimed that, even though most interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) attempt to escape contradictions, there are many hints -coming from present technical and experimental developments in QM- that indicate it could be worth while to engage in a research of this kind. Recently, Arenhart and Krause have raised several arguments against the PAQS [1, 2, 3]. In [11, 12] it was argued that their reasoning presupposes a metaphysical stance according to which the physical representation of reality must be exclusively considered in terms of the equation: Actuality = Reality. However, from a different metaphysical standpoint their problems disappear. It was also argued that, if we accept the idea that quantum superpositions exist in a (contradictory) potential realm, it makes perfect sense to develop QM in terms of a paraconsistent approach and claim that quantum superpositions are contradictory, contextual existents. Following these ideas, and taking as a standpoint an interpretation in terms of the physical notions of power and potentia put forward in [10, 12, 15], we present a paraconsistent formalization of quantum superpositions that attempts to capture the main features of QM.

abstract: Fast entangling gates for trapped ions offer vastly improved gate operation times relative to implemented gates, as well as approaches to trap scaling. Gates on neighbouring ions only involve local ions when performed sufficiently fast, and we find that even a fast gate between distant ions with few degrees of freedom restores all the motional modes given more stringent gate speed conditions. We compare pulsed fast gate schemes, defined by a timescale faster than the trap period, and find that our proposed scheme has less stringent requirements on laser repetition rate for achieving arbitrary gate time targets and infidelities well below $10^{-4}$. By extending gate schemes to ion crystals, we explore the effect of ion number on gate fidelity for coupling neighbouring pairs of ions in large crystals. Inter-ion distance determines the gate time, and a factor of five increase in repetition rate, or correspondingly the laser power, reduces the infidelity by almost two orders of magnitude. We also apply our fast gate scheme to entangle the first and last ions in a crystal. As the number of ions in the crystal increases, significant increases in the laser power are required to provide the short gate times corresponding to fidelity above 0.99.

abstract: Extensive efforts have been expended in developing hybrid quantum systems to overcome the short coherence time of superconducting circuits by introducing the naturally long-lived spin degree of freedom. Among all the possible materials, single-crystal yttrium iron garnet has shown up very recently as a promising candidate for hybrid systems, and various highly coherent interactions, including strong and even ultra-strong coupling, have been demonstrated. One distinct advantage of these systems is that the spins are in the form of well-defined magnon modes, which allows flexible and precise tuning. Here we demonstrate that by dissipation engineering, a non-Markovian interaction dynamics between the magnon and the microwave cavity photon can be achieved. Such a process enables us to build a magnon gradient memory to store information in the magnon dark modes, which decouple from the microwave cavity and thus preserve a long life-time. Our findings provide a promising approach for developing long-lifetime, multimode quantum memories.

abstract: Bare-state population inversion is demonstrated in a two-level system with all dipole matrix elements nonzero. A laser field is resonantly driving the sample whereas a second weaker and lower frequency coherent field additionally pumps it near resonance with the dynamically-Stark-splitted states. Due to existence of differing permanent dipole moments in the excited and ground bare states, quantum coherences among the involved dressed-states are induced leading to inversion in the steady-state. Furthermore, large refractive indices are feasible as well as the determination of the diagonal matrix elements via the absorption or emission spectra. The results apply to available biomolecular, spin or asymmetric quantum dot systems.

abstract: An adiabatic change of parameters along a closed path may interchange the (quasi-)eigenenergies and eigenspaces of a closed quantum system. Such discrepancies induced by adiabatic cycles are refereed to as the exotic quantum holonomy, which is an extension of the geometric phase. "Small" adiabatic cycles induce no change on eigenspaces, whereas some "large" adiabatic cycles interchange eigenspaces. We explain the topological formulation for the eigenspace anholonomy, where the homotopy equivalence precisely distinguishes the larger cycles from smaller ones. An application to two level systems is explained. We also examine the cycles that involve the adiabatic evolution across an exact crossing, and the diabatic evolution across an avoided crossing. The latter is a nonadiabatic example of the exotic quantum holonomy.

abstract: We present a complete set of local unitary invariants for generic multi-qubit systems which gives necessary and sufficient conditions for two states being local unitary equivalent. These invariants are canonical polynomial functions in terms of the generalized Bloch representation of the quantum states. In particular, we prove that there are at most 12 polynomial local unitary invariants for two-qubit states and at most 90 polynomials for three-qubit states. Comparison with Makhlin's 18 local unitary invariants is given for two-quibit systems.

abstract: We show that a squeezed bath, that acts on the central element of a harmonic chain, can drive the whole system to a steady state featuring a series of nested entangled pairs of oscillators that, ideally, covers the whole chain regardless of its size. We study how to realize this effect in various physical implementations, including optomechanical and superconducting devices, using currently available technologies. In these cases no squeezed fields are actually needed, and the squeezed bath is, instead, simulated by quantum reservoir engineering with bichromatic drives.

abstract: The security of device-independent (DI) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols relies on the violation of Bell inequalities. As such, their security can be established based on minimal assumptions about the devices, but their implementation necessarily requires the distribution of entangled states. In a setting with fully trusted devices, any entanglement-based protocol is essentially equivalent to a corresponding prepare-and-measure protocol. This correspondence, however, is not generally valid in the DI setting unless one makes extra assumptions about the devices. Here we prove that a known tight lower bound on the min entropy in terms of the CHSH Bell correlator, which has featured in a number of entanglement-based DI QKD security proofs, also holds in a prepare-and-measure setting, subject only to the assumption that the source is limited to a two-dimensional Hilbert space.

This approach leads us to an additional concept, given by a temporal probability distribution associated with the actual measurement of an observable.

abstract: We experimentally demonstrate an alternative method for the dynamic generation of atomic spin squeezing, building on the interplay between linear coupling and nonlinear phase evolution. Since the resulting quantum dynamics can be seen as rotation and shear on the generalized Bloch sphere, we call this scheme twist-and-turn (TnT). This is closely connected to an underlying instability in the classical limit of this system. The short-time evolution of the quantum state is governed by a fast initial spreading of the quantum uncertainty in one direction, accompanied by squeezing in the orthogonal axis. We find an optimal value of $\xi_{\text{S}}^2=-7.1(3)$ dB in a single BEC and scalability of the squeezing to more than 10^4 particles with $\xi_{\text{S}}^2=-2.8(4)$ dB.

Our formalism provides a recipe for the simultaneous estimation of all three components of a magnetic field. We propose a probe state that surpasses the precision of estimating the three components individually and discuss measurements that come close to attaining the quantum limit. Our study also reveals that too much quantum entanglement may be detrimental to attaining the Heisenberg scaling in quantum metrology.

abstract: The interference of photons emitted by dissimilar sources is an essential requirement for a wide range of photonic quantum information applications. Many of these applications are in quantum communications and need to operate at standard telecommunication wavelengths to minimize the impact of photon losses and be compatible with existing infrastructure. Here we demonstrate for the first time the quantum interference of telecom-wavelength photons from an InAs/GaAs quantum dot single-photon source and a laser; an important step towards such applications. The results are in good agreement with a theoretical model, indicating a high degree of indistinguishability for the interfering photons.

abstract: Digital signatures are widely used for authenticity and transferability of messages. Currently used classical schemes have only computational security. We present an unconditionally secure quantum signature scheme where all trust assumptions on the quantum channels are removed, which also has reduced signature size compared to previous quantum schemes. We show that in practice, the noise threshold for out scheme is less strict than for distilling a highly secure key using quantum key distribution. This shows that "direct" quantum signature schemes can be preferable to signature schemes relying on quantum key distribution.

abstract: In integrable many-particle systems, it is widely believed that the stationary state reached at late times after a quantum quench can be described by a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) constructed from their extensive number of conserved charges. A crucial issue is then to identify a complete set of these charges, enabling the GGE to provide exact steady state predictions. Here we solve this long-standing problem for the case of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain by explicitly constructing a GGE which uniquely fixes the macrostate describing the stationary behaviour after a general quantum quench. A crucial ingredient in our method, which readily generalizes to other integrable models, are recently discovered quasi-local charges. As a test, we reproduce the exact post-quench steady state of the Neel quench problem obtained previously by means of the Quench Action method.

The dynamics require the spectral resolution of the target state, optimized coherent pulses, engineered dissipation, and feedback. As an example, we discuss the preparation of an entangled antiferromagnetic state, and argue that the procedure can be applied to chains of trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.

abstract: Problems of interacting quantum magnetic moments become exponentially complex with increasing number of particles. As a result, classical equations are often used but the validity of reduction of a quantum problem to a classical problem should be justified. In this paper we formulate the correspondence principle, which shows that the classical equations of motion for a system of dipole interacting spins have identical form with the quantum equations. The classical simulations based on the correspondence principle for spin systems provide a practical tool to study different macroscopic spin physics phenomena. Three classical magnetic resonance problems in solids are considered as examples - free induction decay (FID), spin echo and the Pake doublet.

abstract: Quantum-enhanced metrology can be achieved by entangling a probe with an auxiliary system, passing the probe through an interferometer, and subsequently making measurements on both the probe and auxiliary system. Conceptually, this corresponds to performing metrology with the purification of a (mixed) probe state. We demonstrate via the quantum Fisher information how to design mixed states whose purifications are an excellent metrological resource. In particular, we give examples of mixed states with purifications that allow (near) Heisenberg-limited metrology, and provide example entangling Hamiltonians that can generate these states. Finally, we present the optimal measurement and parameter-estimation procedure required to realize these sensitivities (i.e. that saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound). Since pure states of comparable metrological usefulness are typically challenging to generate, it may prove easier to use this approach of entanglement and measurement of an auxiliary system. An example where this may be the case is atom interferometry, where entanglement with optical systems is potentially easier to engineer than the atomic interactions required to produce nonclassical atomic states.

The conjugate state representation of the ICES and the Schmidt decomposing of the ICES are also discussed. As applications, a new squeezing operator and some operator identities by using the ICES are obtained.

abstract: We show that the entanglement between two distant magnetic impurities, generated via electron scattering, can be easily modulated by controlling the magnitude of an applied external electric field. We assume that the two magnetic impurities are fixed and located on an one-dimensional quantum wire. A ballistic electron moving through the wire is scattered off by both impurities, so the electron spin can be seen as a mediator between the spins of the impurities. Heisenberg operators are used to describe the interactions between electron and impurities spins. We use a wave guide formalism to model the ballistic electron wave-function. Entanglement control is shown to be possible for three different protocols of entanglement detection. The effect of detection protocols on the entanglement extraction is discussed.

abstract: Contextuality is a fundamental feature of quantum theory and a necessary resource for quantum computation and communication. It is therefore important to investigate how large can contextuality be in quantum theory. Contextuality witnesses can be expressed as a sum $S$ of $n$ probabilities, such that $1 \le \alpha < \vartheta \le n$ are, respectively, the maximum of $S$ for noncontextual theories and for the theory under consideration. A theory allows for absolute maximal contextuality if it has scenarios in which $\vartheta/\alpha$ tends to $n$. Here we show that quantum theory allows for absolute maximal contextuality despite what is suggested by the examination of the quantum violations of Bell and noncontextuality inequalities considered in the past. Our proof is not constructive and does not single out explicit scenarios. Nevertheless, we identify scenarios in which quantum theory allows for almost absolute maximal contextuality.

abstract: We study the Wigner Transform (WT) in the case of an infinite-dimensional continuous Hilbert space and a discrete Hilbert space of finite prime-number dimensionality $N$. In the discrete case we define a family of WT's as a function of a phase parameter. It is only for a specific value of the parameter that all the properties we have examined, including the matrix elements of the phase-space operator $P$ and the relation between Wigner's function and Kirkwood's distribution, have a parallel in both types of Hilbert space. This close parallel was found constructing the two WT's in terms of a complete set of operators having similar properties, in the sense that the position and momentum operators appear "disentangled" in the two situations. We give a geometric interpretation of the properties involving the phase-space operator in the discrete case.

abstract: In this paper, we firstly briefly review the duality quantum computer. Distinctly, the generalized quantum gates, the basic evolution operators in a duality quantum computer are no longer unitary, and they can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of unitary operators. All linear bounded operators can be realized in a duality quantum computer, and unitary operators are just the extreme points of the set of generalized quantum gates. A d-slits duality quantum computer can be realized in an ordinary quantum computer with an additional qudit using the duality quantum computing mode. Duality quantum computer provides flexibility and clear physical picture in designing quantum algorithms, serving as a useful bridge between quantum and classical algorithms. In this review, we will show that duality quantum computer can simulate quantum systems more efficiently than ordinary quantum computers by providing descriptions of the recent efficient quantum simulation algorithms of Childs et al [Quantum Information & Computation, 12(11-12): 901-924 (2012)] for the fast simulation of quantum systems with a sparse Hamiltonian, and the quantum simulation algorithm by Berry et al [Phys.

abstract: We explore the ability of a qubit probe to characterize unknown parameters of its environment. By resorting to quantum estimation theory, we analytically find the ultimate bound on the precision of estimating key parameters of a broad class of ubiquitous environmental noises ("baths") which the qubit may probe. These include the probe-bath coupling strength, the correlation time of generic bath spectra, the power laws governing these spectra, as well as their dephasing times T2. Our central result is that by optimizing the dynamical control on the probe under realistic constraints one may attain the maximal accuracy bound on the estimation of these parameters by the least number of measurements possible. Applications of this protocol that combines dynamical control and estimation theory tools to quantum sensing are illustrated for a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond used as a probe.

abstract: Unitary quantum theory has no Born Rule nor any stochastic dynamics - hence the notorious problem of reconciling it with the unpredictability and apparent stochastic behaviour of quantum measurements. In this paper I reformulate this problem in the constructor theory of information, where (unitary) quantum systems are special cases of superinformation media - certain physical systems whose laws obey deterministic constructor-theoretic principles. I explain how unpredictability necessarily arises under such laws and is compatible with determinism, thus distinguishing it from randomness. I also show when unpredictability can result in apparent stochastic behaviour. To this end, I model the unpredictable physical processes in superinformation media as games of pure chance, whose player obeys non-probabilistic axioms of rationality; I then prove sufficient conditions for a theory permitting superinformation to inform the player's decisions as if it were a stochastic theory. This generalises the decision-theoretic arguments of Deutsch (1999) and Wallace (2003, 2007, 2012) showing that unitary quantum theory (with no Born Rule) informs the player's decisions as if the Born Rule held. Constructor theory reveals how some assumptions, construed in those arguments as decision-theoretic, follow from physical properties of superinformation media.

abstract: The on-chip integration of quantum light sources has enabled the realization of complex quantum photonic circuits. However, for the practical implementation of such circuits in quantum information applications it is crucial to develop sources delivering entangled quantum photon states with on-demand tunability. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of a widely tunable quantum light source based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a nonlinear directional coupler. We show that spatial photon-pair correlations and entanglement can be reconfigured on-demand by tuning the phase difference between the pump beams and the phase mismatch inside the structure. We demonstrate the generation of split states, robust N00N states, various intermediate regimes and biphoton steering. This fundamental scheme provides an important advance towards the realization of reconfigurable quantum circuitry.

abstract: In this paper, we study the decoherence property of synchronization master equation for networks of qubits interconnected by swapping operators. The network Hamiltonian is assumed to be diagonal with different entries so that it might not be commutative with the swapping operators. We prove a theorem establishing a general condition under which almost complete decohernece is achieved, i.e., all but two of the off-diagonal entries of the network density operator asymptotically tend to zero. This result explicitly shows that quantum dissipation networks tend to forget the information initially encoded when the internal (induced by network Hamiltonian) and external (induced by swapping operators) qubit interactions do not comply with each other.

abstract: Guaranteeing non-repudiation and unforgeability as well as transferability of a signatory is one of the most vital safeguards in today's e-commerce era. Based on fundamental laws of quantum physics, quantum digital signature (QDS) aims to provide information-theoretical security for digital signature widely used nowadays. However, up to date, the previously proposed QDS schemes are impractical due to various challenging problems and most importantly, the requirement of authenticated quantum channels between participants. Here, for the first time, we eliminate all existing problems by proposing a practical and surprisingly simple QDS protocol, whose unconditional security is proven. Our QDS scheme can be implemented over a distance of more than 100 km under technology comparable to quantum key distribution. QDS is an important compliment to quantum key distribution and provides unconditionally secure protection to applications requiring digital signature.

abstract: Environmental noise and disorder play a critical role in quantum particle and wave transport in complex media, including solid-state and biological systems. Recent work has predicted that coupling between noisy environments and disordered systems, in which coherent transport has been arrested due to localization effects, could actually enhance transport. Photonic integrated circuits are promising platforms for studying such effects, with a central goal being the development of large systems providing low-loss, high-fidelity control over all parameters of the transport problem. Here, we fully map out the role of static and dynamic disorder in quantum transport using a low-loss, phase-stable, nanophotonic processor consisting of a mesh of 56 generalized beamsplitters programmable on microsecond timescales. Over 85,600 transport experiments, we observe several distinct transport regimes, including environment-enhanced transport in strong, statically disordered systems. Low loss and programmability make this nanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation experiments.

abstract: We discuss applications of the theory of Quantum Chaos to one of the paradigm models of many-body quantum physics -- the Bose-Hubbard model, which describes, in particular, interacting ultracold Bose atoms in an optical lattice. After preliminary, pure quantum analysis of the system we introduce the classical counterpart of the Bose-Hubbard model and the governing semiclassical equations of motion. We analyze these equations for the problem of Bloch oscillations of cold atoms where a number of experimental results are available. The review is written for non-experts and can be viewed as an introduction to the field.

abstract: The concept of inner friction, by which a quantum heat engine is unable to follow adiabatically its strokes and thus dissipates useful energy, is illustrated in an exact physical model where the working substance consists of an ensemble of misaligned spins interacting with a magnetic field and performing the Otto cycle. The effect of this static disorder under a finite-time cycle gives a new perspective of the concept of inner friction under realistic settings. We investigate the efficiency and power of this engine and relate its performance to the amount of friction from misalignment and to the temperature difference between heat baths. Finally we propose an alternative experimental implementation of the cycle where the spin is encoded in the degree of polarization of photons.

abstract: We theoretically investigate an interferometer composed of four four-wave-mixers by Lie group method. Lie group SU(1,2) characterizes the mode transformations of this kind of interferometer. With vacuum state inputs, the phase sensitivity of SU(1,2) interferometer achieves the Heisenberg limit, and the absolute accuracy beats SU(1,1) interferometer because of higher intensity of light inside the interferometer. For different input cases, the optimal combination of output photon number for detection to obtain the best phase sensitivity is calculated. Our research on SU(1,2) interferometer sheds light on the performance of SU(1,n) interferometer in quantum metrology. Besides, our method of using adjoint representation for calculation can be generalized into any SU(m,n) interferometer.

abstract: We analyze the quantum-state purity of heralded single photons produced from frequency-anti-correlated biphotons. We find that the quantum-state purity in time-frequency domain depends strongly on the response time uncertainty of the trigger-photon detector that heralds the generation of its paired photon. If the trigger response time is much shorter than the two-photon coherence time, the time-frequency quantum-state purity of heralded single photons approaches unity and the heralded single photon is in a nearly pure state. If the trigger response time is much longer than the two-photon coherence time, the heralded photon is then projected onto a mixed state. Making use of the time-frequency entanglement, heralded single photons with a well-defined temporal wave function or a frequency superposition state can be produced and engineered. This time-frequency entanglement allows for shaping heralded single photons through nonlocal spectral modulation.

abstract: We prove the existence of (one-way) communication tasks with a vanishing vs. diverging type of asymptotic gap, which we call "doubly infinite", between quantum information and communication complexities. We do so by showing the following: As the size of the task $n$ increases, the quantum communication complexity of a certain regime of the exclusion game, recently introduced by Perry, Jain, and Oppenheim, scales at least logarithmically in $n$, while the information cost of a winning quantum strategy may tend to zero. The logarithmic lower bound on the quantum communication complexity is shown to hold even if we allow a small probability of error, although the $n$-qubit quantum message of the zero-error strategy can then be compressed polynomially. We leave open the problems of whether the quantum communication complexity of the specified regime scales polynomially in $n$, and whether the gap between quantum and classical communication complexities can be superexponential beyond this regime.

abstract: Hypergraph states form a family of multiparticle quantum states that generalizes the well-known concept of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, cluster states, and more broadly graph states. We study the nonlocal properties of quantum hypergraph states. We demonstrate that the correlations in hypergraph states can be used to derive various types of nonlocality proofs, including Hardy-type arguments, Bell inequalities for genuine multiparticle nonlocality, and an exponentially increasing violation of local realism. Our results suggest that certain classes of hypergraph states are novel resources for quantum metrology and measurement-based quantum computation.

abstract: Quantum mechanics guarantees information-theoretic security against both forgery as well as repudiation through quantum one-way functions. However, a standard quantum digital signature scheme without requiring long term quantum memory is still awaited. We demonstrate here that information-theoretic quantum digital signature scheme without quantum memory is possible by replacing quantum one-way functions with multiparty controlled EPR channels. Such EPR channels controlled by multiparty guarantees that sender cannot repudiate the signature or create a dispute between the receivers. Similarly, it guarantees that any individual recipient cannot forge the message as others have also non-locally correlated information.

abstract: We solve the mixing-demixing transition in repulsive one-dimensional bose-bose mixtures. This is done numerically by means of the continuous matrix product states variational ansatz. We show that the effective low-energy bosonization theory is able to detect the transition whenever the Luttinger parameters are exactly computed. We further characterize the transition by calculating the ground-state energy density, the field-field fluctuations and the density correlations.

abstract: We discuss three Hamiltonians, each with a central-field part $H_{0}$ and a PT-symmetric perturbation $igz$. When $H_{0}$ is the isotropic Harmonic oscillator the spectrum is real for all $g$ because $H$ is isospectral to $H_{0}+g^{2}/2$. When $H_{0}$ is the Hydrogen atom then infinitely many eigenvalues are complex for all $g$. If the potential in $H_{0}$ is linear in the radial variable $r$ then the spectrum of $H$ exhibits real eigenvalues for $0<g<g_{c}$ and a PT phase transition at $g_c$.

abstract: We examine the couplings between two Majorana bound states mediated by topologically-trivial chains. Four types of chain are considered, e.g., the Kitaev chain with/without pairing couplings to the Majorana fermion, the Kitaev chain with next nearest-neighbor couplings in itself, and the Kitaev chain driven by a periodic field. We find that the induced coupling strength depends strikingly on the pairing coupling, the long-range interaction, and the frequency as well as the amplitude of the driving field. We calculate the dependence of the coupling strength on the parameters of the central chain and discuss the application of the coupled Majorana bound states.

abstract: We propose an approach to enhance the mechanical effects of single photons in a two-mode optomechanical system. This is achieved by introducing a resonance-frequency modulation to the cavity fields. When the modulation frequency and amplitude satisfy certain conditions, the mechanical displacement induced by single photons could be larger than the quantum zero-point fluctuation of the oscillating resonator. This method can be used to create distinct mechanical superposition states.

abstract: The preparation of a quantum degenerate gas of heteronuclear molecules has been an outstanding challenge. We use path integral Quantum Monte Carlo simulations to understand the role of interactions and finite temperature effects in the protocol currently employed to adiabatically prepare a low-entropy gas of polar molecules in a lattice starting from an ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. We find that interspecies interactions affect the final temperature of the mixture after the adiabatic loading procedure and detrimentally limit the molecular peak filling. Our conclusions are in agreement with recent experimental measurements [1] and therefore are of immediate relevance for the myriad experiments that aim to form molecules from dual-species atomic gases.

The numerical results show good agreement with analytical results found in the literature. Furthermore, we show the numerical solutions of a system formed by three delta function potentials inside of an infinite quantum well and the harmonic potential with position dependent mass and a delta barrier in the center.

abstract: We theoretically study the optical tomography of the time evolved states generated by the evolution of different kinds of initial wave packets in a Kerr medium. Exact analytical expression for the optical tomogram of the quantum state at any instant during the evolution of a generic initial wave packet is derived in terms of Hermite polynomials. Time evolution of the optical tomogram is discussed for three kinds of initial states: a coherent state, an $m$-photon-added coherent state, and even and odd coherent states. We show the manifestation of revival and fractional revivals in the optical tomograms of the time evolved states. We find that the optical tomogram of the time evolved state at the instants of fractional revivals shows structures with sinusoidal strands. The number of sinusoidal strands in the optical tomogram of the time evolved state at $l$-sub-packet fractional revivals is $l$ times the number of sinusoidal strands present in the optical tomogram of the initial state. We have also investigated the effect of decoherence on the optical tomograms of the states at the instants of fractional revivals for the initial states considered above. We consider amplitude decay and phase damping models of decoherence, and show the direct manifestations of decoherence in the optical tomogram.

abstract: We investigate the coupling of an ensemble of phosphorus donors in an isotopically purified $^{28}$Si host lattice interacting with a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The microwave transmission spectrum of the resonator shows a normal mode splitting characteristic for high cooperativity. The evaluated collective coupling strength $g_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is of the same order as the loss rate of the spin system $\gamma$, indicating the onset of strong coupling. We develop a statistical model to describe the influence of temperature on the coupling strength from $50\,\mathrm{mK}$ to $3.5\,\mathrm{K}$ and find a scaling of the coupling strength with the square root of the number of thermally polarized spins.

authors: H. F. Chau

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.03740
abstract: All known qudit-based prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution (PM-QKD) schemes are more error resilient than their qubit-based counterparts. Their high error resiliency comes partly from the careful encoding of multiple bits of signals used to generate the raw key in each transmitted qudit so that the same eavesdropping attempt causes a higher bit error rate (BER) in the raw key. Here I show that highly error-tolerant PM-QKD schemes can be constructed simply by encoding one bit of classical information in each transmitted qudit in the form $(|i\rangle\pm|j\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$, where $|i\rangle$'s form an orthonormal basis of the $2^n$-dimensional Hilbert space. Moreover, I prove that these schemes can tolerate up to the theoretical maximum of 50% BER for $n\ge 2$, making them the most error-tolerant PM-QKD schemes involving the transmission of unentangled finite-dimensional qudits to date. This shows the potential of processing quantum information using lower-dimensional quantum signals encoded in a higher-dimensional quantum state.

abstract: We present a classification of quantum public-key encryption protocols. There are six elements in quantum public-key encryption: plaintext, ciphertext, public-key, private-key, encryption algorithm and decryption algorithm. According to the property of each element which is either quantum or classical, the quantum public-key encryption protocols can be divided into 64 kinds. Among 64 kinds of protocols, 8 kinds have already been constructed, 52 kinds can be proved to be impossible to construct and the remaining 4 kinds have not been presented effectively yet. This indicates that the research on quantum public-key encryption protocol should be focus on the existed kinds and the unproposed kinds.

abstract: We design fast bias inversions of an asymmetric double well so that the lowest states in each well remain so and free from residual motional excitation. This cannot be done adiabatically, and a sudden bias switch produces in general motional excitation. The residual excitation is suppressed by complementing a predetermined fast bias change with a linear ramp whose time-dependent slope compensates for the displacement of the wells. The process, combined with vibrational multiplexing and demultiplexing, can produce vibrational state inversion without exciting internal states, just by deforming the trap.

abstract: Entanglement is the key quantum resource for improving measurement sensitivity beyond classical limits. However, the production of entanglement in mesoscopic atomic systems has been limited to squeezed states, described by Gaussian statistics. Here we report on the creation and characterization of non-Gaussian many-body entangled states. We develop a general method to extract the Fisher information, which reveals that the quantum dynamics of a classically unstable system creates quantum states that are not spin squeezed but nevertheless entangled. The extracted Fisher information quantifies metrologically useful entanglement which we confirm by Bayesian phase estimation with sub shot-noise sensitivity. These methods are scalable to large particle numbers and applicable directly to other quantum systems.

abstract: The running time of a quantum walk search algorithm depends on both the structure of the search space (graph) and the configuration of marked locations. While the first dependence have been studied in a number of papers, the second dependence remains mostly unstudied. We study search by quantum walks on two-dimensional grid using the algorithm of Ambainis, Kempe and Rivosh [AKR05]. The original paper analyses one and two marked location cases only. We move beyond two marked locations and study the behaviour of the algorithm for an arbitrary configuration of marked locations. In this paper we prove two results showing the importance of how the marked locations are arranged. First, we present two placements of $k$ marked locations for which the number of steps of the algorithm differs by $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ factor. Second, we present two configurations of $k$ and $\sqrt{k}$ marked locations having the same number of steps and probability to find a marked location.

abstract: We generalize the Milne quantization condition to non-Hermitian systems. In the general case the underlying nonlinear Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation needs to be replaced by a nonlinear integral differential equation. However, when the system is PT-symmetric or/and quasi/pseudo-Hermitian the equations simplify and one may employ the original energy integral to determine its quantization. We illustrate the working of the general framework with the Swanson model and two explicit examples for pairs of supersymmetric Hamiltonians. In one case both partner Hamiltonians are Hermitian and in the other a Hermitian Hamiltonian is paired by a Darboux transformation to a non-Hermitian one.

abstract: A quantum effect characterized by a dependence of the angular frequency associated with the confinement of a neutral particle to a quantum ring on the quantum numbers of the system and the Aharonov-Casher geometric phase is discussed. Then, it is shown that persistent spin currents can arise in a two-dimensional quantum ring in the presence of a Coulomb-type potential. A particular contribution to the persistent spin currents arises from the dependence of the angular frequency on the geometric quantum phase.

abstract: The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for quantum processes with built-in rewrite rules. The rewrite rules allow equalities to be derived entirely graphically, leading to the question of completeness: can any equality that is derivable using matrices also be derived graphically? The ZX-calculus is known to be complete for scalar-free pure qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics, meaning any equality between two pure stabilizer operators that is true up to a non-zero scalar factor can be derived using the graphical rewrite rules. Here, we replace those scalar-free rewrite rules with correctly scaled ones and show that, by adding one new diagram element and a new rewrite rule, the calculus can be made complete for pure qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics with scalars. This completeness property allows amplitudes and probabilities to be calculated entirely graphically. We also explicitly consider stabilizer zero diagrams, i.e. diagrams that represent a zero matrix, and show that two new rewrite rules suffice to make the calculus complete for those.

abstract: By mapping the Hamiltonians of the two-mode and 2-photon Rabi models to differential operators in suitable Hilbert spaces of entire functions, we prove that the two models are defined (i.e. possess entire wavefunctions) only if the frequency $\omega$ and coupling strength $g$ satisfy certain constraints. This is in sharp contrast to the quantum Rabi model for which entire wavefunctions always exist. For model parameters fulfilling the aforesaid constraints we determine transcendental equations whose roots give the regular energy eigenvalues of the models. Furthermore, we show that the $k$-photon Rabi model does not possess entire wave functions (and thus is ill-defined) for $k\geq 3$ in the Bargmann-Hilbert space for all non-trivial model parameters. This implies that for $k\geq 3$ the $k$-photon Rabi model is non-diagonalizable, unlike its RWA cousin, the $k$-photon Jaynes-Cummings model which can be completely diagonalized for all $k$.

abstract: We present a quantifier of non-classical correlations for bipartite, multi-mode Gaussian states. It is derived from the Discriminating Strength measure, introduced for finite dimensional systems in A. Farace et al., New. J. Phys. 16, 073010 (2014). As the latter the new measure exploits the Quantum Chernoff Bound to gauge the susceptibility of the composite system with respect to local perturbations induced by unitary gates extracted from a suitable set of allowed transformations (the latter being identified by posing some general requirements). Closed expressions are provided for the case of two-mode Gaussian states obtained by squeezing or by linearly mixing via a beam-splitter a factorized two-mode thermal state. For these density matrices, we study how non-classical correlations are related with the entanglement present in the system and with its total photon number.

In GRAPH-COLLISION we are given free access to a graph $(V,E)$ and access to a function $f:V\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ as a black box. We are asked to determine if there exist $(u,v) \in E$, such that $f(u)=f(v)=1$. In TRIANGLE we have a black box access to an adjacency matrix of a graph and we have to determine if the graph contains a triangle. For both of these problems the known lower bounds are trivial ($\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and $\Omega(n)$, respectively) and there is no known matching upper bound.

abstract: Two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the major tools for analysing the chemical structure of organic molecules and proteins. Despite its power, this technique requires long measurement times, which, particularly in the recently emerging diamond based single molecule NMR, limits its application to stable samples. Here we demonstrate a method which allows to obtain the spectrum by collecting only a small fraction of the experimental data. Our method is based on matrix completion which can recover the full spectral information from randomly sampled data points. We confirm experimentally the applicability of this technique by performing two dimensional electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) experiments on a two spin system consisting of a single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre in diamond coupled to a single 13C nuclear spin. We show that the main peaks in the spectrum can be obtained with only 10 % of the total number of the data points. We believe that our results reported here can find an application in all types of two dimensional spectroscopy, as long as the measured matrices have a low rank.

abstract: We theoretically investigate interactions between non-degenerate mechanical oscillators mediated by a time-dependent cavity field. We obtain a reduced master equation valid for all optomechanical systems operating in the weak coupling regime. This master equation includes all forms of decoherence and back-action due to the dissipation of the field mediating the interaction. We apply the master equation to study two resonant coupling schemes within a rotating-wave approximation: the beam splitter Hamiltonian and the two-mode parametric amplifier. In both cases, the effective unitary interaction can be made arbitrarily strong compared to the decoherence due to dissipation of the mediating field by choosing appropriate detunings.

abstract: Einstein-Smoluchowski diffusion, damped harmonic oscillations, and spatial decoherence are special cases of an elegant class of quantum Brownian motion models that is invariant under linear symplectic transformations. Here we prove that for each member of this class there is a preferred timescale such that the dynamics, considered stroboscopically, can be re-written exactly as unitary evolution interrupted periodically by a measure-and-prepare POVM with respect to a fixed overcomplete set of pure Gaussian states. This is relevant to the continuing search for the best way to describe pointer states and pure decoherence in systems with continuous variables, and gives a concrete sense in which the decoherence can be said to arise from a complete measurement of the system by its environment. We also extend some of the results of Di\'{o}si and Kiefer to the symplectic covariant formalism and compare them with the preferred timescales and Gaussian states associated with the POVM form.

abstract: A quantized form of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) modes propagating on the metal thin film is provided, which is based on the Green's tensor method. Since the media will be considered lossy and dispersive, the amplification and attenuation of the SPP modes in various dielectric media, by applying different field frequencies, can be studied. We will also illustrate the difference between behavior of coherent and squeezed SPP modes in the amplifying media.

abstract: As an undergraduate exercise, quantum uncertainty evaluations for dimensionless variables of position and momentum in the bouncing ball and harmonic oscillator potentials are equal with their classical counterparts. This equality may hide quantum feature of low energy levels. Here, we change the potential intervals to be non-symmetric for harmonic oscillator potential and symmetric for linear potential and observe that quantum uncertainty of those potentials could still be expressed in terms of quantum number $n$ or still need to correspondence principle to approach classical limit. Moreover, our numerical calculations include higher powers of position for potential.

abstract: Fluctuations of the atomic positions are at the core of a large class of unusual material properties ranging from quantum para-electricity and charge density wave to, possibly, high temperature superconductivity. Their measurement in solids is subject of an intense scientific debate focused on the research of a methodology capable of establishing a direct link between the variance of the ionic displacements and experimentally measurable observables. Here we address this issue by means of non-equilibrium optical experiments performed in shot-noise limited regime. The variance of the time dependent atomic positions and momenta is directly mapped into the quantum fluctuations of the photon number of the scattered probing light. A fully quantum description of the non-linear interactions between photonic and phononic fields unveils evidences of squeezing of thermal phonons in $\alpha-$quartz.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a manifestation of quantum correlations exhibited by quantum systems, that allows for entanglement certification when one of the subsystems is not characterized. Detecting steerability of quantum states is essential to assess their suitability for quantum information protocols with partially trusted devices. We provide a hierarchy of sufficient conditions for the steerability of bipartite quantum states of any dimension, including continuous variable states. Previously known steering criteria are recovered as special cases of our approach. The proposed method allows us to derive optimal steering witnesses for arbitrary families of quantum states, and provides a systematic framework to analytically derive non-linear steering criteria. We discuss relevant examples and, in particular, provide an optimal steering witness for a lossy single-photon Bell state; the witness can be implemented just by linear optics and homodyne detection, and detects steering with a higher loss tolerance than any other known method. Our approach is readily applicable to multipartite steering detection and to the characterization of joint measurability.

abstract: Based on the interaction between different spatial modes, semiconductor Bragg-reflection waveguides provide a highly functional platform for non-linear optics. Therefore, the control and engineering of the properties of each spatial mode is essential. Despite the multimodeness of our waveguide, the well-established Fabry-Perot technique for recording fringes in the optical transmission spectrum can successfully be employed for a detailed linear optical characterization when combined with Fourier analysis. A prerequisite for the modal sensitivity is a finely resolved transmission spectrum that is recorded over a broad frequency band. Our results highlight how the features of different spatial modes, such as their loss characteristics and dispersion properties, can be separated from each other allowing their comparison. The mode-resolved measurements are important for optimizing the performance of such multimode waveguides by tailoring the properties of their spatial modes.

abstract: We argue that quantum optimal control can and should be done with analytic control functions, in the vast majority of applications. First, we show that discretizing continuous control functions as piecewise-constant functions prevents high accuracy optimization at reasonable computational costs. Second, we argue that the number of control parameters required is on-par with the dimension of the object manipulated, and therefore one may choose parametrization by other considerations, e.g. experimental suitability and the potential for physical insight into the optimized pulse. Third, we note that optimal control algorithms which make use of the gradient of the goal function with respect to control parameters are generally faster and reach higher final accuracies than non gradient-based methods. Thus, if the gradient can be efficiently computed, it should be used. Fourth, we present a novel way of computing the gradient based on an equation of motion for the gradient, which we evolve in time by the Taylor expansion of the propagator. This allows one to calculate any physically relevant analytic controls to arbitrarily high precision. The combination of the above techniques is GOAT (Gradient Optimization of Analytic conTrols) - gradient-based optimal control for analytic control functions, utilizing exact evolution in time of the derivative of the propagator with respect to arbitrary control parameters.

abstract: The quantum circuit model allows gates between any pair of qubits yet physical instantiations allow only limited interactions. We address this problem by providing an interaction graph together with an efficient method for compiling quantum circuits so that gates are applied only locally. The graph requires each qubit to interact with 4 other qubits and yet the time-overhead for implementing any n-qubit quantum circuit is 6 log n. Building a network of quantum computing nodes according to this graph enables the network to emulate a single monolithic device with minimal overhead.

abstract: In this paper we analyze selected evolution models of $N-$level open quantum systems in order to find the minimal number of observables (Hermitian operators) such that their expectation values at some time instants determine the accurate representation of the quantum system. The assumption that lies at the foundation of this approach to quantum tomography claims that time evolution of an open quantum system can be expressed by the Kossakowski - Lindblad equation of the form $\dot{\rho} = \mathbb{L} \rho$, which is the most general type of Markovian and time-homogeneous master equation which preserves trace and positivity. We consider the cases when the generator of evolution can be presented by means of two or more double commutators. Determining the minimal number of observables required for quantum tomography can be the first step towards optimal tomography models for $N-$level quantum systems.

Here we report an exhaustive analysis of the dynamics and steady state properties of such a system locally in contact with different temperature reservoirs. We show that thermalisation only occurs 'accidentally'. We further examine the nonclassical features and energy fluxes implied by the dynamics of the double-well system, thus exploring its finite-time thermodynamics in relation to the settlement of nonclassical correlations between the wells.

abstract: The precise calculations of the Wigner's d-matrix are important in various research fields. Due to the presence of large numbers, direct calculations of the matrix using the Wigner's formula suffer from loss of precision. We present a simple method to avoid this problem by expanding the d-matrix into a complex Fourier series and calculate the Fourier coefficients by exactly diagonalizing the angular-momentum operator $J_{y}$ in the eigenbasis of $J_{z}$. This method allows us to compute the d-matrix and its various derivatives for spins up to a few thousand. The precision of the d-matrix from our method is about $10^{-14}$ for spins up to $100$.

abstract: We characterize the asymptotic performance of a class of positive operator valued measurements (POVMs) where the only task is to make measurements on independent and identically distributed quantum states on finite-dimensional systems. The POVMs we utilize here can be efficiently described in terms of a reasonably small set of parameters. Their analysis furthers the development of a quantum method of types. They deliver provably optimal performance in asymmetric hypothesis testing and in the transmission of classical messages over quantum channels. We now relate them to the recently developed $\alpha-z$ divergences by giving an operational interpretation for one of the limiting cases where $\alpha\to1$ and $z\to0$ in terms of probabilities for certain measurement outcomes. We provide additional structural insights which connect the underlying representation theoretic objects to partial sums of the entries of unitary matrices. At last, we concentrate on the special case of qubits. We are able to give a complete description of the asymptotic detection probabilities for all POVM elements described here. We take the opportunity to define a family of functions on pairs of semi-definite matrices which obeys the quantum generalizations of R\'enyi's axioms except from the generalized mean value axiom. This family is described by limiting values of $\alpha-z$ divergences for the extremal values of the parameter.

abstract: We introduce geometric measures of entanglement for indistinguishable particles, which apply to mixed states, multipartite systems, and arbitrary dimensions. They are based on generalized (i.e., not necessarily finite) norms on the set of quantum states and lead to the first necessary and sufficient computational separability criterion in this general setting. The coherent approach developed in the paper allows us to compare, in particular, entanglement for fermionic and distinguishable particles: The entanglement measure for fermionic particles coincides with the corresponding entanglement measure for distinguishable particles up to a factor of $k!$ where $k$ is the number of particles involved. By this result the amount of entanglement emerging from fermi statistics alone is clearly separated from the overall amount of entanglement. Finally, our techniques are applied to entanglement related to Schmidt and Slater numbers.

abstract: We describe the implementation of weak quantum measurements in superconducting qubits, focusing specifically on transmon type devices in the circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. To access this regime, the readout cavity is probed with on average a single microwave photon. Such low-level signals are detected using near quantum-noise-limited superconducting parametric amplifiers. Weak measurements yield partial information about the quantum state, and correspondingly do not completely project the qubit into an eigenstate. As such, we use the measurement record to either sequentially reconstruct the quantum state at a given time, yielding a quantum trajectory, or to close a direct quantum feedback loop, stabilizing Rabi oscillations indefinitely.

abstract: Verification and characterisation of quantum states are crucial for the implementation of quantum information processing, especially for many-body systems such as cluster states in optical lattices. In theory, it is simple to estimate the distance of a state with a target cluster state by measurement of a set of suitable stabilizer operators. However, experimental non-idealities can lead to complications, in particular cross-talk in single site addressing and measurement. By making a suitable choice of stabilizer operator sets we may be able to reduce, but not eliminate, these cross-talk errors. The degree of cross-talk mitigation depends on the geometry of the cluster state and subsets of cross-talk free stabilizers can be generated for certain shapes using a simple algorithm.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The trace of an arbitrary product of quantum operators with the density operator is rendered as a multiple phase space integral of the product of their Weyl symbols with the Wigner function. Interspersing the factors with various evolution operators, one obtains an evolving correlation. The kernel for the matching multiple integral that evolves within the Weyl representation is identified with the trace of a single compound unitary operator. Its evaluation within a semiclassical approximation then becomes a sum over the periodic trajectories of the corresponding classical compound canonical transformation. The search for periodic trajectories can be bypassed by an exactly equivalent initial value scheme, which involves a change of integration variable and a reduced compound unitary operator. Restriction of all the operators to observables with smooth non-oscillatory Weyl symbols reduces the evolving correlation to a single phase space integral. If each observable undergoes independent Heisenberg evolution, the overall correlation evolves classically. Otherwise, the kernel acquires a nonclassical phase factor, though it still depends on a purely classical compound trajectory: e.g. the fase for a double return of the quantum Loschmidt echo does not coincide with twice the phase for a single echo.

abstract: The minimum probability of error (MPE) measurement discriminates between a set of candidate quantum states with the minimum average error probability allowed by quantum mechanics. Conditions for a measurement to be MPE were derived by Yuen, Kennedy and Lax (YKL). MPE measurements have been found for states that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a transitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed geometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good measurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability of error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set involves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general. Our first contribution is a formula for the MPE and conditional probabilities of GU sets, using group representation theory. Next, we consider sets of pure states that have multiple orbits under the group action. Such states are termed compound geometrically uniform (CGU). MPE measurements for general CGU sets are not known. In this paper, we show how our representation-theoretic description of optimal measurements for GU sets naturally generalizes to the CGU case. We show how to compute the MPE measurement for CGU sets by reducing the problem to solving a few simultaneous equations. The number of equations depends on the sizes of the multiplicity space of irreducible representations. For many common group representations (such as those of several practical good linear codes), this is much more tractable than solving large semi-definite programs---which is what is needed to solve the YKL conditions numerically for arbitrary state sets. We show how to evaluate MPE measurements for CGU states for some examples relevant to quantum-limited classical optical communication.

abstract: Semi-classical theories are approximations to quantum theory that treat some degrees of freedom classically and others quantum mechanically. In the usual approach, the quantum degrees of freedom are described by a wave function which evolves according to some Schr\"odinger equation with a Hamiltonian that depends on the classical degrees of freedom. The classical degrees of freedom satisfy classical equations that depend on the expectation values of quantum operators. In this paper, we study an alternative approach based on Bohmian mechanics. In this approach the quantum system is not only described by the wave function, but with additional variables such as particle positions or fields. By letting the classical equations of motion depend on these variables, rather than the quantum expectation values, a semi-classical approximation is obtained that is closer to the exact quantum results than the usual approach. We discuss the Bohmian semi-classical approximation in various context, such as non-relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics and quantum gravity. The main motivation comes from quantum gravity. The quest for a quantum theory is still going on. Therefore a semi-classical approach where gravity is treated classically may be an approximation that already captures some quantum gravitational aspects.

abstract: We study the pairwise quantum discord (QD) for a symmetric multi-qubit system in different types of noisy channels, such as phase-flip, amplitude damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels. Using the QD and geometric measure of quantum discord (GMQD) to quantify quantum correlations, some analytical or numerical results are presented. The results show that, the dynamics of the pairwise QD is related to the number of spin particles $N$ as well as initial parameter $\theta$ of the one-axis twisting collective state. With the number of spin particles $N$ increasing, the amount of the pairwise QD increases. However, when the amount of the pairwise QD arrives at a stable maximal value, the pairwise QD is independence of the number of spin particles $N$ increasing. The behavior of the pairwise QD is symmetrical during a period $0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi$. Moreover, we compare the pairwise QD dynamics with the GMQD for a symmetric multi-qubit system in different types of noisy channels.

abstract: We use an one dimensional model of a square barrier embedded in an infinite potential well to demonstrate that tunneling leads to a complex behavior of the wave function and that the degree of complexity may be quantified by use of the spatial entropy function defined by S = -\int |\Psi(x,t)|^2 ln |\Psi(x,t)|^2 dx. There is no classical counterpart to tunneling, but a decrease in the tunneling in a short time interval may be interpreted as an approach of a quantum system to a classical system. We show that changing the square barrier by increasing the height/width do not only decrease the tunneling but also slows down the rapid rise of the entropy function, indicating that the entropy growth is an essentially quantum effect.

abstract: Quatum nonlocality as a valuable resource is of vital importance in quantum information processing. The characterization of the resource has been extensively investigated mainly for pure states, while relatively less is know for mixed states. Here we prove the existence of the optimal GHZ paradox by using a novel and simple method to extract an optimal state that can saturate the tradeoff relation between quantum nonlocality and the state purity. In this paradox, the logical inequality which is formulated by the GHZ-typed event probabilities can be violated maximally by the optimal state for any fixed amount of purity (or mixedness). Moreover, the optimal state can be described as a standard GHZ state suffering flipped color noise. The maximal amount of noise that the optimal state can resist is 50%. We suggest our result to be a step toward deeper understanding of the role played by the AVN proof of quantum nonlocality as a useful physical resource.

abstract: The demonstration and use of nonlocality, as defined by Bell's theorem, rely strongly on dealing with non-detection events due to losses and detector inefficiencies. Otherwise, the so-called detection loophole could be exploited. The only way to avoid this is to have detection efficiencies that are above a certain threshold. We introduce the intermediate assumption of limited detection efficiency, e.g. in each run of the experiment the overall detection efficiency is lower bounded by $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an adversarial scenario, the adversaries have arbitrary large but not full control over the inefficiencies. We analyze the set of possible correlations that fulfil Limited Detection Locality (LDL) and show that they necessarily satisfy some linear Bell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts violation of one of these inequalities for all $\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, nonlocality can be demonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection efficiencies. Finally we propose a generalized scheme that uses this characterization to deal with detection inefficiencies, which interpolates between the two usual schemes, postselection and outcome assignment.

abstract: Machine-designed control of complex devices or experiments can discover strategies superior to those developed via simplified models. We describe an online optimization algorithm based on Gaussian processes and apply it to optimization of the production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). BEC is typically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is approximately optimal for s-wave, ergodic dynamics with two-body interactions and no other loss rates, but likely sub-optimal for many real experiments. Machine learning using a Gaussian process, in contrast, develops a statistical model of the relationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC produced. This is an online process, and an active one, as the Gaussian process model updates on the basis of each subsequent experiment and proposes a new set of parameters as a result. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine learner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times fewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique. Furthermore, we show the internal model developed can be used to determine which parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant, providing insight into the optimization process.

abstract: The fluctuations exhibited by the cross-sections generated in a compound-nucleus reaction or, more generally, in a quantum-chaotic scattering process, when varying the excitation energy or another external parameter, are characterized by the width Gamma_corr of the cross-section correlation function. In 1963 Brink and Stephen [Phys. Lett. 5, 77 (1963)] proposed a method for its determination by simply counting the number of maxima featured by the cross sections as function of the parameter under consideration. They, actually, stated that the product of the average number of maxima per unit energy range and Gamma_corr is constant in the Ercison region of strongly overlapping resonances. We use the analogy between the scattering formalism for compound-nucleus reactions and for microwave resonators to test this method experimentally with unprecedented accuracy using large data sets and propose an analytical description for the regions of isolated and overlapping resonances.

abstract: We experimentally study a driven-dissipative Josephson junction array, realized with a weakly interacting Bose Einstein condensate residing in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Engineered losses on one site act as a local dissipative process, while tunneling from the neighboring sites constitutes the driving force. We characterize the emerging steady-states of this atomtronic device. With increasing dissipation strength $\gamma$ the system crosses from a superfluid state, characterized by a coherent Josephson current into the lossy site to a resistive state, characterized by an incoherent hopping transport. For intermediate values of $\gamma$, the system exhibits bistability, where a superfluid and a resistive branch coexist. We also study the relaxation dynamics towards the steady-state, where we find a critical slowing down, indicating the presence of a non-equilibrium phase transition.

abstract: An important topic of interest in imaging is the construction of protocols that are not diffraction limited. This can be achieved in a variety of ways, including classical superresolution techniques or quantum entanglement-based protocols. Here, we consider superresolving imaging in the far field using higher-order intensity correlations. We show that third and fourth order correlations can improve upon the first and second order correlations that are traditionally used in classical optics and Hanbury Brown and Twiss type experiments. The improvement is achieved entirely by post-processing of the data. As a demonstrator, we simulate the far field intensity distribution of a circular aperture that emits thermal light and use maximum likelihood estimation to determine the radius of the aperture. We compare the achieved precision to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and find that the variance of measurements for the third and fourth order correlation functions are indeed closer to the Cram\'er-Rao bound than that of the second order correlation function. The method presented here is general, and can be used for all kinds of incoherent emitters, geometries, and types of noise.

The operation of these systems typically depends on their energetic structure, yet probing their energy-landscape can be extremely challenging; they have many degrees of freedom, which may be hard to isolate and measure independently. Here we show that a qubit (a two-level quantum system) with a biased energy-splitting can directly probe the spectral properties of a complex system. Our work is based on the completely-positive and trace-preserving map formalism, which treats any unknown dynamics as a `black-box' process. This black box contains information about the system with which the probe interacts, which we access by measuring the survival probability of the initial state of the probe as function of the energy-splitting and the process time. Fourier transforming the results yields the energy spectrum of the complex system, and the results can further determine its initial coherence. Thus, our probe can be directly implemented to determine energy landscapes of complex molecules as well as to test for coherent superposition of mesoscopic objects.

abstract: Properties of random mixed states of order $N$ distributed uniformly with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt measure are investigated. We show that for large $N$, due to the concentration of measure, the trace distance between two random states tends to a fixed number ${\tilde D}=1/4+1/\pi$, which yields the Helstrom bound on their distinguishability. To arrive at this result we apply free random calculus and derive the symmetrized Marchenko--Pastur distribution, which is shown to describe numerical data for the model of two coupled quantum kicked tops. Asymptotic values for the fidelity, Bures and transmission distances between two random states are obtained. Analogous results for quantum relative entropy and Chernoff quantity provide other bounds on the distinguishablity of both states in a multiple measurement setup due to the quantum Sanov theorem.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.05124
abstract: Here we use perturbation techniques based on the averaging method to investigate Rabi oscillations in cw and pulse-driven two-level systems (TLS's). By going beyond the rotating-wave approximation, especifically to second-order in perturbation, we obtain the Bloch-Siegert shift of the TLS resonant frequency, in which the resonant frequency increases with the driving field amplitude. This frequency shift implies that short resonant $\pi$-pulses in which the Rabi frequency is approximately 40\% or higher of the transition frequency do not achieve complete inversion in TLS's. Hence, guided by analytical results based on the averaging technique, we propose two methods for obtaining population inversions in the TLS driven by short $\pi$-pulses: one with chirping and the other with pulse shaping and near resonance blue-shifted detuning. Both methods minimize dephasing due to the Bloch-Siegert shift, reduce the dependance of the excitation of the TLS on the pulse phase, and are very effective in achieving complete population inversions.

abstract: We introduce a new scalable cavity quantum electrodynamics platform which can be used for quantum computing. This system is composed of coupled photonic crystal (PC) cavities which their modes lie on a Dirac cone in the whole super crystal band structure. Quantum information is stored in quantum dots that are positioned inside the cavities. We show if there is just one quantum dot in the system, energy as photon is exchanged between the quantum dot and the Dirac modes sinusoidally. Meanwhile the quantum dot becomes entangled with Dirac modes. If we insert more quantum dots into the system, they also become entangled with each other.

abstract: In quantum mechanics physical processes procede by two different mechanisms. John von Neumann enumerated them as 1, the "discontinuous ... arbitrary changes by measurement," and 2, continuous evolution via the Schroedinger Equation. That the physical world does not obey a single overriding law - unitary evolution by the Schroedinger Equation - is philosophically disturbing to some. Others face it with equanimity. One narrative that preserves the findings of quantum mechanics yet does produce pure unitary evolution is that of the multiverse. Given below is the narrative by which Born's Rule emerges without pre-assigning to it the notion of probability. It requires that the number of universes in the multiverse not be enumerable!

abstract: We demonstrate control of the absolute phase of an optical lattice with respect to a single trapped ion. The lattice is generated by off-resonant free-space laser beams, we actively stabilize its phase by measuring its ac-Stark shift on a trapped ion. The ion is localized within the standing wave to better than 2\% of its period. The locked lattice allows us to apply displacement operations via resonant optical forces with a controlled direction in phase space. Moreover, we observe the lattice-induced phase evolution of spin superposition states in order to analyze the relevant decoherence mechanisms. Finally, we employ lattice-induced phase shifts for inferring the variation of the ion position over 157~$\mu$m range along the trap axis at accuracies of better than 6~nm.

abstract: The orthogonality of cat and displaced cat states, underlying Heisenberg limited measurement in quantum metrology, is studied in the limit of large number of states. The mesoscopic superposition of the generalized cat state is correlated with the corresponding state overlap function, controlled by the sub-Planck structures arising from phase space interference. The asymptotic expression of this overlap function is evaluated and the validity of large phase space support and distinguishability of the constituent states, in which context the asymptotic limit is achieved, are discussed in detail. For large number of coherent states, uniformly located on a circle, the overlap function significantly matches with the diffraction pattern for a circular ring source with uniform angular strength. This is in accordance with the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, where the overlap function, similar to the mutual coherence function, matches with a diffraction pattern. The physical situation under consideration is delineated in phase space by utilizing Husimi-Q function.

abstract: An inhomogeneous Kaluza-Klein compactification to four dimensions, followed by a conformal transformation, results in a system with position dependent mass (PDM). This origin of a PDM is quite different from the condensed matter one. A substantial generalization of a previously studied nonlinear oscillator with variable mass is obtained, wherein the position dependence of the mass of a nonrelativistic particle is due to a dilatonic coupling function emerging from the extra dimension. Previously obtained solutions for such systems can be extended and reinterpreted as nonrelativistic particles interacting with dilaton fields, which, themselves, can have interesting structures. An application is presented for the nonlinear oscillator, where within the new scenario the particle is coupled to a dilatonic string.

abstract: In this paper, I attempt a personal account of my understanding of the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, which has been largely in the tradition of the Copenhagen interpretation. I assume that (i) the quantum state is a representation of knowledge of a (real or hypothetical) observer relative to her experimental capabilities; (ii) measurements have definite outcomes in the sense that only one outcome occurs; (iii) quantum theory is universal and the irreversibility of the measurement process is only "for all practical purposes". These assumptions are analyzed within quantum theory and their consistency is tested in Deutsch's version of the Wigner's friend gedanken experiment, where the friend reveals to Wigner whether she observes a definite outcome without revealing which outcome she observes. The view that holds the coexistence of the "facts of the world" common both for Wigner and his friend runs into the problem of the hidden variable program. The solution lies in understanding that "facts" can only exist relative to the observer.

abstract: It is known that any bipartite unitary operator of Schmidt rank three is equivalent to a controlled unitary under local unitaries. We propose a standard form of such operators. Using the form we improve the upper bound for the entanglement cost to implement such operators under local operations and classical communications (LOCC), and provide a corresponding protocol. A part of our protocol is based on a recursive-control protocol which is helpful for implementing other unitary operators. We show that any bipartite permutation unitary of Schmidt rank three can be implemented using LOCC and two ebits. We give two protocols for implementing bipartite permutation unitaries of any Schmidt rank $r$, and showed that one of the protocol uses $O(r)$ ebits of entanglement and $O(r)$ bits of classical communication, while these two types of costs for the other protocol scale as $O(r\log r)$ but the actual values are smaller for all $r<1100$. Based on this we obtain upper bounds of the number of nonlocal CNOT gates needed to implement bipartite classical reversible maps using classical circuits under two different conditions. We also quantify the entangling power of bipartite permutation unitaries of Schmidt rank two and three. We show that they are respectively $1$ ebit and some value between $\log_2 9 - 16/9$ and $\log_2 3$ ebits.

abstract: We construct the 1D colored Kitaev model based on the solution of Yang-Baxter equation. We show that the colored Kitaev model possesses both triple degenerate ground states and non-trivial topological winding number. Hence, the colored Kitaev model is a direct generalization of 1D Kitaev model. On the other hand, inspired by the 3-body Majorana model proposed by Lee and Wilczek, we define a new 3-body Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{123}$ based on Yang-Baxter equation. Different from the Majorana doubling, $\hat{H}_{123}$ holds triple degeneracy in each energy level. The triple degeneracy is protected by two symmetry operators of the system, $\omega$-parity $P$($\omega=e^{{\textrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{3}}}$) and emergent operator $\Gamma$, which are the generalization of parity $P_{M}$ and emergent Majorana operator in Lee-Wilczek model, respectively. Both the colored Kitaev model and $\hat{H}_{123}$ are SU(3)-like models in color space. In comparison with the Majorana models at SU(2)-level, we find that the SU(3)-like models are exactly the generalization of Majorana models.

abstract: Complex projective t-designs, particularly SICs and full sets of MUBs, play an important role in quantum information. We introduce a generalization which we call conical t-designs. They include arbitrary rank symmetric informationally complete measurements (SIMs) and full sets of arbitrary rank mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs). They are deeply implicated in the description of entanglement (as we show in a subsequent paper). Viewed in one way a conical 2-design is a symmetric decomposition of a separable Werner state (up to a normalization factor). Viewed in another way it is a certain kind of polytope in the Bloch body. In the Bloch body picture SIMs and full sets of MUMs form highly symmetric polytopes (a single regular simplex in the one case; the convex hull of a set of orthogonal regular simplices in the other). We give the necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary polytope to be what we call a homogeneous conical 2-design. This suggests a way to search for new kinds of projective 2-design.

abstract: We consider the quantum witness test of macroscopic realism and derive an upper bound for possible violations of this equality due to quantum mechanics. The bound depends only on the number of possible outcomes for the blind measurement at the heart of the witness protocol. Mirroring recent results for the related Leggett-Garg inequality, we show that quantum mechanics can saturate the algebraic bound for large systems. We also establish a connection between the quantum witness and the trace distance between density matrices.

abstract: A theory for wave mechanical systems with local inversion and translation symmetries is developed employing the two-dimensional solution space of the stationary Schrodinger equation. The local symmetries of the potential are encoded into corresponding local basis vectors in terms ofsymmetry-induced two-point invariant currents which map the basis amplitudes between symmetry-related points. A universal wavefunction structure in locally symmetric materials is revealed, independently of the physical boundary conditions, by using special local bases which are adapted to the existing local symmetries. The local symmetry bases enable efficient computation of spatiallyresolved wave amplitudes in systems with arbitrary combinations of local inversion and translation symmetries. The approach opens the perspective of a flexible analysis and control of wave localization in structurally complex systems.

abstract: We construct multipartite graph states whose dimension is the power of a prime number. This is realized by the finite field, as well as the generalized controlled-NOT quantum circuit acting on two qudits. We propose the standard form of graph states up to local unitary transformations and particle permutations. The form greatly simplifies the classification of graph states as we illustrate up to five qudits. We also show that some graph states are multipartite maximally entangled states in the sense that any bipartite of the system produces a bipartite maximally entangled state. We further prove that 4-partite maximally entangled states exist when the dimension is an odd number at least three or a multiple of four.

We develop an analytic model in a three-dimensional Hilbert subspace to explain this phenomenon and employ numerical simulations of the density-matrix master equation to confirm our analysis. We also show that the modulated Rabi oscillation survives in presence of dissipations and other non-ideal factors.

We show how this nuclear spin takes over the role of the sensor spin, keeping the characteristic time-scales of detection on the same order but with a longer life-time allowing it to detect a larger volume of the sample which is not possible by the sensor alone.

abstract: Quantum electrodynamics under conditions of distinguishability of interacting matter entities, and of controlled actions and back-actions between them, is considered. Such "mesoscopic quantum electrodynamics" is shown to share its dynamical structure with the classical stochastic electrodynamics. In formal terms, we demonstrate that all general relations of the mesoscopic quantum electrodynamics may be recast in a form lacking Planck's constant. Mesoscopic quantum electrodynamics is therefore subject to "doing quantum electrodynamics while thinking classically," allowing one to substitute essentally classical considerations for quantum ones without any loss in generality. Implications of these results for the quantum measurement theory are discussed.

abstract: For general two-electron two-centre integrals over Slater-type orbitals (STOs), the use of the Neumann expansion for the Coulomb interaction potential yields infinite series in terms of few basic functions. In many important cases the number of terms necessary to achieve convergence by a straightforward summation is large and one is forced to calculate the basic integrals of high order. We present a systematic approach to calculation of the higher-order terms in the Neumann series by large-order expansions of the basic integrals. The final expressions are shown to be transparent and straightforward to implement, and all auxiliary quantities can be calculated analytically. Moreover, numerical stability and computational efficiency are also discussed. Results of the present work can be used to speed up calculations of the STOs integral files, but also to study convergence of the Neumann expansion and develop appropriate convergence accelerators.

abstract: The generation of nonclassical states of light in miniature chips is a crucial step towards practical implementations of future quantum technologies. Semiconductor materials are ideal to achieve extremely compact and massively parallel systems and several platforms are currently under development. In this context, spontaneous parametric down conversion in AlGaAs devices combines the advantages of room temperature operation, possibility of electrical injection and emission in the telecom band. Here we report on a chip-based AlGaAs source, producing indistinguishable and energy-time entangled photons with a brightness of $7.2\times10^6$ pairs/s and a signal-to-noise ratio of $141\pm12$. Indistinguishability between the photons is demonstrated via a Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment with a visibility of $89\pm3\%$, while energy-time entanglement is tested via a Franson interferometer leading to a value for the Bell parameter $ S=2.70\pm0.10$.

abstract: To advance quantum information science a constant pursuit is the search for physical systems that meet the stringent requirements for creating and preserving quantum entanglement. In atomic physics, robust two-qubit entanglement is typically achieved by strong, long-range interactions in the form of Coulomb interactions between ions or dipolar interactions between Rydberg atoms. While these interactions allow fast gates, atoms subject to these interactions must overcome the associated coupling to the environment and cross-talk among qubits. Local interactions, such as those requiring significant wavefunction overlap, can alleviate these detrimental effects yet present a new challenge: To distribute entanglement, qubits must be transported, merged for interaction, and then isolated for storage and subsequent operations. Here we show how, via a mobile optical tweezer, it is possible to prepare and locally entangle two ultracold neutral atoms, and then separate them while preserving their entanglement. While ultracold neutral atom experiments have measured dynamics consistent with spin entanglement, we are now able to demonstrate two-particle coherence via application of a local gradient and parity measurements; this new entanglement-verification protocol could be applied to arbitrary spin-entangled states of spatially-separated atoms. The local entangling operation is achieved via ultracold spin-exchange interactions, and quantum tunneling is used to combine and separate atoms. Our toolset provides a framework for dynamically entangling remote qubits via local operations within a large-scale quantum register.

The signal and control fields are both guided along the nanofiber, which enables strong nonlinear interactions with the surrounding atoms at relatively low powers. Transit-time broadening is found to be a significant EIT decoherence mechanism in this tightly-confined waveguiding geometry. Nonetheless, we observe significant EIT and controlled polarization rotation using control-field powers of only a few microWatts in this relatively robust warm-atom nanofiber system.

abstract: We examine quantum normal typicality and ergodicity properties for quantum systems whose dynamics are generated by Hamiltonians which have residual degeneracy in their spectrum and resonance in their energy gaps. Such systems can be considered atypical in the sense that degeneracy, which is usually a sign of symmetry, is naturally broken in typical systems due to stochastic perturbations. In particular, we prove a version of von Neumann's quantum ergodic theorem, where a modified condition needs to hold in order to have normal typicality and ergodicity. As a result, we show that degeneracy of spectrum does not considerably modify the condition of the theorem, whereas the existence of resonance is more dominant for obstructing ergodicity.

abstract: We present a generalization of the double semion topological quantum field theory to higher dimensions, as a theory of $d-1$ dimensional surfaces in a $d$ dimensional ambient space. We construct a local Hamiltonian which is a sum of commuting projectors and analyze the excitations and the ground state degeneracy. Defining a consistent set of local rules requires the sign structure of the ground state wavefunction to depend not just on the number of disconnected surfaces, but also upon their higher Betti numbers through the semicharacteristic. For odd $d$ the theory is related to the toric code by a local unitary transformation, but for even $d$ the dimension of the space of zero energy ground states is in general different from the toric code and for even $d>2$ it is also in general different from that of the twisted $Z_2$ Dijkgraaf-Witten model.

abstract: We prove analytically that both fermionic and bosonic uniform d-dimensional lattices can be reduced to a set of independent one-dimensional modes. This reduction leads to the conclusion that the dynamics in uniform fermionic and bosonic lattices is always ballistic. By the use of the Jordan-Wigner transformation we extend our analysis to spin lattices, proving the existence of both ballistic and non-ballistic subspaces in any dimension and for any system size. We then relate the nature of transport with the number of excitations in the spin lattice, indicating that a single excitation propagates always ballistically and that the non-ballistic behavior of uniform spin lattices is a consequence of the interaction between different excitations.

abstract: What gravitational field is generated by a massive quantum system in a spatial superposition? This is one of the most important questions in modern physics, and after decades of intensive theoretical and experimental research, we still do not know the answer. On the experimental side, the difficulty lies in the fact that gravity is weak and requires large masses to be detectable. But for large masses, it becomes increasingly difficult to generate spatial quantum superpositions, which live sufficiently long to be detected. A delicate balance between opposite quantum and gravitational demands is needed. Here we show that this can be achieved in an optomechanics scenario. We propose an experimental setup, which allows to decide whether the gravitational field generated by a quantum system in a spatial superposition is the superposition of the two alternatives, or not. We estimate the magnitude of the effect and show that it offers good perspectives for observability. Performing the experiment will mark a breakthrough in our understanding of the relationship between gravity and quantum theory.

abstract: We study the generation of spontaneous entanglement between two qubits chirally coupled to a waveguide. The maximum achievable concurrence is demonstrated to increase by a factor of $4/e \sim 1.5$ as compared to the non-chiral coupling situation. The proposed entanglement scheme is shown to be robust against variation of the qubit properties such as detuning and separation, which are critical in the non-chiral case. This result relaxes the restrictive requirements of the non-chiral situation, paving the way towards a realistic implementation. Our results demonstrate the potential of chiral waveguides for quantum entanglement protocols.

abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a provably secure way for two distant parties to establish a common secret key, which then can be used in a classical cryptographic scheme. Using quantum entanglement, one can reduce the necessary assumptions that the parties have to make about their devices, giving rise to device-independent QKD (DIQKD). However, in all existing protocols to date the parties need to have an initial (at least partially) random seed as a resource. In this work, we show that this requirement can be dropped. Using recent advances in the fields of randomness amplification and randomness expansion, we demonstrate that it is sufficient for the message the parties want to communicate to be (partially) unknown to the adversaries -- an assumption without which any type of cryptography would be pointless to begin with. One party can use her secret message to locally generate a secret sequence of bits, which can then be openly used by herself and the other party in a DIQKD protocol. Hence, our work reduces the requirements needed to perform secure DIQKD and establish safe communication.

abstract: The quantum mechanical expression relating two commuting operators is reformulated such that the power method (also called method of moments) for iteratively calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors becomes applicable. The new iterative scheme thus obtained allows to pre-select a quantum number of one of the two commuting operators and then calculate a corresponding eigenvalue of the other operator. The result is the common eigenvector of the eigenvalue pair. Among others the method may be used to calculate excited states, cope with degeneracy and/or accelerate convergence. Small example calculations are presented as a 'Proof-of-Concept' and to reveal some properties of the new method.

abstract: We investigate the non-Markovianity of continuous variable Gaussian quantum channels through the evolution of an operational metrological quantifier, namely the Gaussian interferometric power, which captures the minimal precision that can be achieved using bipartite Gaussian probes in a black-box phase estimation setup, where the phase shift generator is \emph{a priori} unknown. We observe that the monotonicity of the Gaussian interferometric power under the action of local Gaussian quantum channels on the ancillary arm of the bipartite probes is a natural indicator of Markovian dynamics; consequently, its breakdown for specific maps can be used to construct a witness and an effective quantifier of non-Markovianity. In our work, we consider two paradigmatic Gaussian models, the damping master equation and the quantum Brownian motion, and identify analytically and numerically the parameter regimes that give rise to non-Markovian dynamics. We then quantify the degree of non-Markovianity of the channels in terms of Gaussian interferometric power, showing in particular that even nonentangled probes can be useful to witness non-Markovianity. This establishes an interesting link between the dynamics of bipartite continuous variable open systems and their potential for optical interferometry. The results are an important supplement to the recent research on characterization of non-Markovianity in continuous variable systems.

abstract: The recently proposed centre of mass decoherence of composite objects due to gravitational time-dilation [Pikovski et al., Nat.Phys. 15. June (2015); arXive:1311.1095] is confronted with the principle of equivalence between gravity and observer's acceleration. In the laboratory frame, a positional superposition $\vert x_1\rangle+\vert x_2\rangle$ can quickly decohere whereas in the free-falling frame, as I argue, the superposition can survive for almost arbitrary long times. The paradoxical result is explained by the so far unappreciated feature of the proposed model: the centre of mass canonical subsystem is ambiguous, it is different in the laboratory and the free-falling frames, respectively. The covariance of the Pikovski et al. Hamiltonian is non-relativistic. In particular, gravity $g$ cancels from the Hamiltonian if we transform coordinate $x$ into $x-gt^2/2$ and we do not transform time $t$ at all. That is the free-falling (i.e.: gravity-free) frame. This invalidates the same authors' Answer in arXiv:1508.03296v1 averting my observations, because it is completely based on Rindler transformation of $t$ whereas Rindler frame is not gravity-free in the authors' theory.

abstract: The attempt to gain a theoretical understanding of the concept of time in quantum mechanics has triggered significant progress towards the search for faster and more efficient quantum technologies. One of such advances consists in the interpretation of the time-energy uncertainty relations as lower bounds for the minimal evolution time between two distinguishable states of a quantum system, also known as quantum speed limits. We investigate how the non uniqueness of a bona fide measure of distinguishability defined on the quantum state space affects the quantum speed limits and can be exploited in order to derive improved bounds. Specifically, we establish an infinite family of quantum speed limits valid for unitary and nonunitary evolutions, based on an elegant information geometric formalism. Our work unifies and generalizes existing results on quantum speed limits, and provides instances of novel bounds which are tighter than any established one based on the conventional quantum Fisher information. We illustrate our findings with relevant examples, clarifying the role of classical populations versus quantum coherences in the determination and saturation of the speed limits. Our results can find applications in the optimization and control of quantum technologies such as quantum computation and metrology, and might provide new insights in fundamental investigations of quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: Dissipative electromagnetic response and scattering geometry are potential sources for the appearance of a negative Casimir entropy. We show that the dissipative contribution familiar from the plane-plane geometry appears also in the plane-sphere and the sphere-sphere geometries and adds to the negative Casimir entropy known to exist in these geometries even for perfectly reflecting objects. Taking the sphere-sphere geometry as an example, we carry out a scattering-channel analysis which allows to distinguish between the contributions of different polarizations. We demonstrate that dissipation and geometry share a common feature making possible negative values of the Casimir entropy. In both cases there exists a scattering channel whose contribution to the Casimir free energy vanishes in the high-temperature limit. While the mode-mixing channel is associated with the geometric origin, the transverse electric channel is associated with the dissipative origin of the negative Casimir entropy. By going beyond the Rayleigh limit, we find even for large distances that negative Casimir entropies can occur also for Drude-type metals provided the dissipation strength is sufficiently small.

abstract: We probe the indistinguishability of photons emitted by a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) via time- and temperature- dependent two-photon interference (TPI) experiments. An increase in temporal-separation between two consecutive photon emission events, reveals a decrease in TPI visibility on a time scale $(13.7\pm2.3)\,$ns, theoretically described by a non-Markovian noise process in agreement with fluctuating charge-traps in the QD's vicinity. Phonon-induced pure dephasing results in a detrimental decrease in TPI visibility from $(96\pm4)\,$ % at $10\,$K to a vanishing visibility at $40\,$K.

However, a special circumstance arises when a primary objective is pitted against a set of secondary objectives, which we show leads to invariant behavior of the secondary objectives upon the primary one approaching its optimal value. Still, practical relationships among the objectives will generally lead to a threshold, beyond which system re-engineering is required to further increase the primary objective. This finding is of broad significance for reaching high performance in quantum technologies

abstract: Any solution to the Yang-Baxter equation yields a family of representations of braid groups. Under certain conditions, identified by Turaev, the appropriately normalized trace of these representations yields a link invariant. Any Yang-Baxter solution can be interpreted as a two-qudit quantum gate. Here we show that if this gate is non-entangling, then the resulting invariant of knots is trivial. We thus obtain a general connection between topological entanglement and quantum entanglement, as suggested by Kauffman et al.

abstract: When classical or quantum information is broadcast to separate receivers, there exist codes that encrypt the encoded data such that the receivers cannot recover it when performing local operations and classical communication, but they can decode reliably if they bring their systems together and perform a collective measurement. This phenomenon is known as quantum data hiding and hitherto has been studied under the assumption that noise does not affect the encoded systems. With the aim of applying the quantum data hiding effect in practical scenarios, here we define the data-hiding capacity for hiding classical information using a quantum channel. With this notion, we establish a regularized upper bound on the data hiding capacity of any quantum broadcast channel and we prove that coherent-state encodings have a strong limitation on their data hiding rates. We then prove a lower bound on the data hiding capacity of channels that map the maximally mixed state to the maximally mixed state (we call these channels "mictodiactic"---they can be seen as a generalization of unital channels when the input and output spaces are not necessarily isomorphic) and argue how to extend this bound to generic channels and to more than two receivers.

abstract: Photons have proven to be excellent carriers of quantum information, and play essential roles in numerous quantum information processing (QIP) applications. In particular, heralded single- photon sources via spontaneous parametric-down conversion (SPDC) have been a key technology for demonstrating small-scale QIP, yet their low generation efficiency is a critical limitation for further scaling up optical QIP technology. In order to efficiently overcome the probabilistic nature of SPDC, here we demonstrate time multiplexing for up to 30 time slots of a periodically pumped heralded single-photon source, using a switchable low-loss optical storage cavity. We observe a maximum single-photon probability of 38.6% in periodic output time windows, corresponding to 6 times enhancement over a non-multiplexed source, but with no increase in the contribution of unwanted multi-photon events. Combining this time-multiplexing technique with a heralded source producing pure single-photon states should enable larger scale optical QIP systems than ever realized.

abstract: The representation of graph states in the X-basis as well as the calculation of graph state overlaps can efficiently be performed by using the concept of X-Chains [Phys. Rev. A 92(1) 012322]. We present a necessary and sufficient criterion for X-chains and show that they can efficiently be determined by Bareiss algorithm. An analytical approach for searching X-chain groups of a graph state is proposed. Furthermore we generalize the concept of X-chains to so-called Euler chains, whose induced subgraphs are Eulerian. This approach helps to determine if a given vertex set is an X-chain and we show how Euler chains can be used in the construction of multipartite Bell inequalities for graph states.

The herald photon triggers a telecom C-band laser pulse. The telecom single photon and the laser pulse are combined and coupled to a standard telecom fiber. Low background time correlation of the classical and quantum signal behind the fiber shows successful telecommunication channel multiplexing.

abstract: We present two efficient schemes for the deterministic generation and the complete nondestructive analysis of hyperentangled Bell states in both the polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom (DOFs) of two-photon systems, assisted by the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds coupled to microtoroidal resonators as a result of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). With the input-output process of photons, two-photon polarization-spatial hyperentangled Bell states can be generated in a deterministic way and their complete nondestructive analysis can be achieved. These schemes can be generalized to generate and analyze hyperentangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of multi-photon systems as well. Compared with previous works, these two schemes relax the difficulty of their implementation in experiment as it is not difficult to obtain the $\pi$ phase shift in single-sided NV-cavity systems. Moreover, our schemes do not require that the transmission for the uncoupled cavity is balanceable with the reflectance for the coupled cavity. Our calculations show that these schemes can reach a high fidelity and efficiency with current technology, which may be a benefit to long-distance high-capacity quantum communication with two DOFs of photon systems.

abstract: Quantum wires can transport quantum states between distant locations in a solid state scenario without the need for intricate controls in the intervening distance. Fixed usage, time independent schemes permit the pre-manufacture and characterisation of the wires, minimising the resultant error. Nevertheless, noise inevitably enters the system and, even if it acts locally on a single spin at a single instant of time, the intrinsic dynamics of the system rapidly propagate it into a massively correlated error. By modifying the error correction procedure, we prove that in spite of this, standard error correcting codes (the Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes) can be used to protect states against sufficiently low rates of noise during transport through a perfect quantum wire.

abstract: To decide whether a quantum channel is degradable is relatively easy: one has to find just a single example of a degrading quantum channel. But in general, no conclusive criterion exists to show the opposite. Using elementary methods we derive a necessary and sufficient condition to decide under what circumstances the conclusion is unambiguous. The findings lead to an extension of the antidegradability region for qubit and qutrit transpose depolarizing channels. In the qubit case we reproduce the known results for the class of qubit depolarizing channels (due to their equivalence). One of the consequences is that the optimal qubit and qutrit asymmetric cloners possess a single-letter quantum capacity formula. We also investigate the ramifications of the criterion for the search of exclusively conjugate degradable channels.

Harnessing the duality has been, however, hindered by a time-consuming process to match a temporal mode of quadrature measurement with that correlated with photon detection. Here, we demonstrate real-time quadrature measurement of a single-photon wavepacket induced by a photon detection, by utilizing continuous temporal-mode-matching between homodyne detection and an exponentially rising temporal mode. Our method will open a way to universal measurement-based quantum computation.

abstract: We study how quantum and thermal noise affects synchronization of two optomechanical limit-cycle oscillators. Classically, in the absence of noise, optomechanical systems tend to synchronize either in-phase or anti-phase. Taking into account the fundamental quantum noise, we find a regime where fluctuations drive transitions between these classical synchronization states. We investigate how this "mixed" synchronization regime emerges from the noiseless system by studying the classical-to-quantum crossover and we show how the time scales of the transitions vary with the effective noise strength. In addition, we compare the effects of thermal noise to the effects of quantum noise.

comments: 14 pages, 2 figures

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.06202
abstract: Elementary particle detectors fall broadly into only two classes: phase-transformation devices, such as the bubble chamber, and charge-transfer devices like the Geiger-Mueller tube. Quantum measurements are seen to involve transitions from a long-lived metastable state (e. g., superheated liquid or a gas of atoms between charged capacitor plates) to a thermodinamically stable condition. A detector is then a specially prepared object undergoing a metastable-to-stable transformation that is significantly enhanced by the presence of the measured particle, which behaves, in some sense, as the seed of a process of heterogeneous nucleation. Based on this understanding of the operation of a conventional detector, and using results of orthogonality-catastrophe theory, we argue that, in the thermodynamic limit, the pre-measurement Hamiltonian is not the same as that describing the detector during or after the interaction with a particle and, thus, that superpositions of pointer states (Schroedinger cats) are unphysical because their time evolution is ill defined. Examples of particle-induced changes in the Hamiltonian are also given for ordinary systems whose macroscopic parameters are susceptible to radiation damage, but are not modified by the interaction with a single particle.

abstract: We investigated the depth dependence of coherence times of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers through precisely depth controlling by a moderately oxidative at 580{\deg}C in air. By successive nanoscale etching, NV centers could be brought close to the diamond surface step by step, which enable us to trace the evolution of the number of NV centers remained in the chip and to study the depth dependence of coherence times of NV centers with the diamond etching. Our results showed that the coherence times of NV centers declined rapidly with the depth reduction in their last about 22 nm before they finally disappeared, revealing a critical depth for the influence of rapid fluctuating surface spin bath. By monitoring the coherence time variation with depth, we could make a shallow NV center with long coherence time for detecting external spins with high sensitivity.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.06231
abstract: The Clauser-Horne/Eberhard inequality has taken center stage in tests of locality thanks to its immunity to the detection loophole. I describe a local model that violates the inequality using a plausible mechanism relying upon a parameter of the apparatus, the emission rate. The effect is generated through the analysis of time-tagged data using a standard windowed coincidence method; however, the detection times are not functions of the measurement settings. The analysis does not introduce the nonlocal behavior typical of previous coincidence window models. This finding has implications for the design and interpretation of experiments, as it shows that the coincidence window loophole cannot be eliminated by a demonstration of independence of the detection times and settings. The paper describes a reliable coincidence counting method and shows that it delivers an accurate count of true coincidences. Recent experimental tests of local realism based on the Clauser-Horne/Eberhard inequality are considered and it is shown that in one case (Christensen et al.) the emission rate is appropriately limited to ensure valid counting, and the data confirms local realism; in a second case (Giustina et al.) the experiment fails to appropriately limit the emission rate, and the claimed violation can be accounted for locally.

The boson realizations are employed to construct $\mathcal{D}$-functions, which are the matrix elements of arbitrary irreducible representations, of SU$(n)$ in the canonical basis. We demonstrate that our $\mathcal{D}$-function algorithm offers significant advantage over the two competing procedures, namely factorization and exponentiation.

abstract: We consider possible non-signaling composites of probabilistic models based on euclidean Jordan algebras. Subject to some reasonable constraints, we show that no such composite exists having the exceptional Jordan algebra as a direct summand. We then construct several dagger compact categories of such Jordan-algebraic models. One of these neatly unifies real, complex and quaternionic mixed-state quantum mechanics, with the exception of the quaternionic "bit". Another is similar, except in that (i) it excludes the quaternionic bit, and (ii) the composite of two complex quantum systems comes with an extra classical bit. In both of these categories, states are morphisms from systems to the tensor unit, which helps give the categorical structure a clear operational interpretation. A no-go result shows that the first of these categories, at least, cannot be extended to include spin factors other than the (real, complex, and quaternionic) quantum bits, while preserving the representation of states as morphisms. The same is true for attempts to extend the second category to even-dimensional spin-factors. Interesting phenomena exhibited by some composites in these categories include failure of local tomography, supermultiplicativity of the maximal number of mutually distinguishable states, and mixed states whose marginals are pure.

abstract: Nonlinear variants of quantum mechanics can solve tasks that are impossible in standard quantum theory, such as perfectly distinguishing nonorthogonal states. Here we derive the optimal protocol for distinguishing two states of a qubit using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a model of nonlinear quantum mechanics that arises as an effective description of Bose-Einstein condensates. Using this protocol, we present an algorithm for unstructured search in the Gross-Pitaevskii model, obtaining an exponential improvement over a previous algorithm of Meyer and Wong. This result establishes a limitation on the effectiveness of the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation. More generally, we demonstrate similar behavior under a family of related nonlinearities, giving evidence that the ability to quickly discriminate nonorthogonal states and thereby solve unstructured search is a generic feature of nonlinear quantum mechanics.

abstract: Dephasing and relaxation of the nuclear spins coupled to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center during optical initialization and readout is an important issue for various applications of this hybrid quantum register. Here we present both an analytical description and a numerical simulation for this process, which agree reasonably with the experimental measurements. For the NV center under cyclic optical transition, our analytical formula not only provide a clear physics picture, but also allows controlling the nuclear spin dissipation by tuning an external magnetic field. For more general optical pumping, our analytical formula reveals significant contribution to the nuclear spin dissipation due to electron random hopping into/out of the $m=0$ (or $m=\pm1$) subspace. This contribution is not suppressed even under saturated optical pumping and/or vanishing magnetic field, thus providing a possible solution to the puzzling observation of nuclear spin dephasing in zero perpendicular magnetic field [M. V. G. Dutt \textit{et al}., Science \textbf{316}, 1312 (2007)]. It also implies that enhancing the degree of spin polarization of the nitrogen-vacancy center can reduce the effect of optical induced nuclear spin dissipation.

abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics of two interacting two-level qubits coupled to a bosonic bath was previously studied using the quantum-state-diffusion (QSD) equation, where a stochastic state is used to describe the system. In this study, we provide another perspective on this system by deriving the analytic form of the master equation, which describes the system with a reduced density matrix. Then, we validate the master equation by examining entanglement generation and state purity. In addition, with the master equation, we observe the effects from first-order noise and notice that a good asymptotic approximation to the master equation can be made by neglecting the first-order noise.

abstract: We use one single, few-picosecond-long, variably polarized laser pulse to deterministically write any selected spin state of a quantum dot confined dark exciton whose life and coherence time are six and five orders of magnitude longer than the laser pulse duration, respectively. The pulse is tuned to an absorption resonance of an excited dark exciton state, which acquires non-negligible oscillator strength due to residual mixing with bright exciton states. We obtain a high fidelity one-to-one mapping from any point on the Poincar\'e sphere of the pulse polarization to a corresponding point on the Bloch sphere of the spin of the deterministically photogenerated dark exciton.

abstract: To the active basis choice decoy state quantum key distribution systems with detector efficiency mismatch, we present a modified attack strategy, which is based on faked states attack, with quantum nondemolition measurement ability to restress the threat of detector efficiency mismatch. Considering that perfect quantum nondemolition measurement ability dose not exist in real life, we also propose a practical attack strategy using photon number resolving detectors. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results show that, without changing the channel, our attack strategies are serious threats to decoy state quantum key distribution systems. The eavesdropper may get some information ab out the secret key without causing any alarms. Besides, the lower bound of detector efficiency mismatch to run our modified faked states attack successfully with perfect quantum nondemolition measurement ability is also given out, which provides the producers of quantum key distribution systems with a reference and can be treated as the approximate secure bound of detector efficiency mismatch in decoy state quantum key distribution systems.

abstract: Photons with a twisted phase front can carry a discrete, in principle unbounded amount of orbital angular momentum (OAM). The large state space allows for complex types of entanglement, interesting both for quantum communication and for fundamental tests of quantum theory. However, the distribution of such entangled states over large distances was thought to be infeasible due to influence of atmospheric turbulence, indicating a serious limitation on their usefulness. Here we show that it is possible to distribute quantum entanglement encoded in OAM over a turbulent intra-city link of 3 kilometers. We confirm quantum entanglement of the first two higher-order levels (with OAM=$\pm 1 \hbar$ and $\pm 2 \hbar$). They correspond to four new quantum channels orthogonal to all that have been used in long-distance quantum experiments so far. Therefore a promising application would be quantum communication with a large alphabet. We also demonstrate that our link allows access to up to 11 quantum channels of OAM. The restrictive factors towards higher numbers are technical limitations that can be circumvented with readily available technologies.

abstract: We sense the motion of a trapped atomic ion using a sequence of state-dependent ultrafast momentum kicks. We use this atom interferometer to characterize a nearly-pure quantum state with $n=1$ phonon and accurately measure thermal states ranging from near the zero-point energy to $\bar{n}\sim 10^4$, with the possibility of extending at least 100 times higher in energy. The complete energy range of this method spans from the ground state to far outside of the Lamb-Dicke regime, where atomic motion is greater than the optical wavelength. These interferometric techniques are useful for characterizing ultrafast entangling gates between multiple trapped ions, and may also be used for sensing electromagnetic fields over a wide dynamic range.

abstract: We study the dynamics of many-body quantum spin-$1/2$ systems with long-range interaction, as the ones recently realized with trapped ions. Our analysis reveals a scenario that is richer than the usual expectation that interactions of longer range should necessarily lead to faster dynamics. Long-range interaction induces superselection rules that become exact in the thermodynamic limit. They confine the dynamics to invariant subspaces, which are shielded from the long-range interaction. Consequently, the evolution may even freeze as the system size increases. We establish an analogy between this effective shielding and the onset of quantum Zeno subspaces, with the difference that here they are driven by system size, instead of interaction strength.

abstract: We propose a cold atom implementation to attain the continuum limit of (1+1)-d CP(N-1) quantum field theories. These theories share important features with (3+1)-d QCD, such as asymptotic freedom and $\theta$ vacua. Moreover, their continuum limit can be accessed via the mechanism of dimensional reduction. In our scheme, the CP(N-1) degrees of freedom emerge at low energies from a ladder system of SU(N) quantum spins, where the N spin states are embodied by the nuclear Zeeman states of alkaline-earth atoms, trapped in an optical lattice. Based on Monte Carlo results, we establish that the continuum limit can be demonstrated by an atomic quantum simulation by employing the feature of asymptotic freedom. We discuss a protocol for the adiabatic state preparation of the ground state of the system, the real-time evolution of a false $\theta$-vacuum state after a quench, and we propose experiments to unravel the phase diagram at non-zero density.

abstract: Several mechanical realizations of PR-Boxes are discussed. Apart from superluminal correlations, which are known not to be realizable by classical devices, the requirements (1) PR-condition on input-output relations, (2) non-signaling, and (3) allowing for independent measurements are discussed separately. The examples show that internal signaling (inside the box) does not invariably imply the possibility of external signaling and may externally be attributed to contextuality. The proposed model requires two classical bits to be exchanged internally in order to realize the defined requirements. However, with EPR correlations this can be reduced to one classical bit.

abstract: We report pulsed electron-spin resonance (ESR) measurements on an ensemble of Bismuth donors in Silicon cooled at 10mK in a dilution refrigerator. Using a Josephson parametric microwave amplifier combined with high-quality factor superconducting micro-resonators cooled at millikelvin temperatures, we improve the state-of-the-art sensitivity of inductive ESR detection by nearly 4 orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the detection of 1700 bismuth donor spins in silicon within a single Hahn echo with unit signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, reduced to just 150 spins by averaging a single Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence. This unprecedented sensitivity reaches the limit set by quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field instead of thermal or technical noise, which constitutes a novel regime for magnetic resonance.

abstract: The average time $T$ required for high-fidelity readout of quantum states can be significantly reduced via a real-time adaptive decision rule. An adaptive decision rule stops the readout as soon as a desired level of confidence has been achieved, as opposed to setting a fixed readout time $t_f$. The performance of the adaptive decision is characterized by the "adaptive-decision speedup," $t_f/T$. In this work, we reformulate this readout problem in terms of the first-passage time of a particle undergoing stochastic motion. This formalism allows us to theoretically establish the maximum achievable adaptive-decision speedups for several physical two-state readout implementations. We show that for two common readout schemes (the Gaussian latching readout and a readout relying on state-dependent decay), the speedup is bounded by $4$ and $2$, respectively, in the limit of high single-shot readout fidelity. We experimentally study the achievable speedup in a real-world scenario by applying the adaptive decision rule to a readout of the nitrogen-vacancy-center (NV-center) charge state. We find a speedup of $\approx 2$ with our experimental parameters. In addition, we propose a simple readout scheme for which the speedup can in principle be increased without bound as the fidelity is increased. Our results should lead to immediate improvements in nano-scale magnetometry based on spin-to-charge conversion of the NV-center spin, and provide a theoretical framework for further optimization of the bandwidth of quantum measurements.

Our algorithm is based on the recent $\tilde O(n^{5/4})$-query algorithm given by Le Gall [FOCS 2014] for triangle finding over dense graphs (here $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph). We show in particular that triangle finding can be solved with $O(n^{5/4-\epsilon})$ queries for some constant $\epsilon>0$ whenever the graph has at most $O(n^{2-c})$ edges for some constant $c>0$.

abstract: We introduce a new quantum measurement that is defined to be symmetric in the sense of uniform Fisher information across a set of parameters that injectively represent pure quantum states in the neighborhood of a fiducial state. The measurement is locally informationally complete---i.e., it uniquely determines these parameters, as opposed to distinguishing two arbitrary quantum states---and it is maximal in the sense of saturating tightenings of the multi-parameter quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. For a $d$-dimensional quantum system, requiring only local informational completeness allows us to reduce the number of outcomes of the measurement from $4d-4$, for the usual notion of global pure-state informational completeness, to $2d-1$.

abstract: Nonlinear entanglement witnesses have wider range entanglement detection ability relative to the linear ones. Here we construct them for a four qubit mutually unbiased basis Bell diagonal density matrices. To this aim we specify the convex feasible region with positive partial transpose states. To reveal the entangled regions, we present some appropriate optimal non-decomposable linear entanglement witnesses as the envelope of family of linear entanglement witnesses and in this case, the nonlinear witnesses have been nonlinear functional of linear witnesses. The results of the study are evaluated and assessed in the light of the problems of four qubit entanglement detection.

abstract: We generalize and extend the stochastic path integral formalism and action principle for continuous quantum measurement introduced in [A. Chantasri, J. Dressel and A. N. Jordan, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 88}, 042110 (2013)], where the optimal dynamics, such as the most-likely paths, are obtained by extremizing the action of the path integral. In this work, we apply exact functional methods as well as develop a perturbative approach to investigate the statistical behaviour of continuous quantum measurement, with examples given for the qubit case. For qubit measurement with zero qubit Hamiltonian, we find analytic solutions for average trajectories and their variances while conditioning on fixed initial and final states. For qubit measurement with unitary evolution, we use the perturbation method to compute expectation values, variances, and multi-time correlation functions of qubit trajectories in the short-time regime. Moreover, we consider continuous qubit measurement with feedback control, using the action principle to investigate the global dynamics of its most-likely paths, and finding that in an ideal case, qubit state stabilization at any desired pure state is possible with linear feedback. We also illustrate the power of the functional method by computing correlation functions for the qubit trajectories with a feedback loop to stabilize the qubit Rabi frequency.

abstract: The adiabatic perturbation is shown to be singular from the exact solution of a spin-1/2 particle in a uniformly rotating magnetic field. Due to a non-adiabatic effect, its quantum trajectory on a Bloch sphere is a cycloid traced by a circle rolling along an adiabatic path. As the magnetic field rotates more and more slowly, the time-energy uncertainty, proportional to the distance of the quantum trajectory, calculated by the exact solution is entirely different from the one obtained by the adiabatic path traced by the instantaneous state. However, the non-adiabatic Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase, measured by the area enclosed by the exact path, approaches smoothly the adiabatic Berry phase, proportional to the area enclosed by the adiabatic path. The singular limit of the time-energy uncertainty and the regular limit of the geometric phase are associated with the arc length and arc area of the cycloid on a Bloch sphere, respectively. Prolate and curtate cycloids are also traced by different initial states outside and inside of the rolling circle, respectively. The axis trajectory of the rolling circle, parallel to the adiabatic path, is shown to be an example of transitionless driving. The non-adiabatic resonance is visualized by the number of complete cycloid arcs.

abstract: We determine the conditions for the existence of non-transverse factorizing magnetic fields in general spin arrays with anisotropic XYZ couplings of arbitrary range. It is first shown that a uniform maximally aligned completely separable eigenstate can exist just for fields ${h}_s$ parallel to a principal plane and forming four straight lines in field space, with the alignment direction different from that of ${h}_s$ and determined by the anisotropy. Such state always becomes a non-degenerate ground state (GS) for sufficiently strong (yet finite) fields along these lines, including both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) type systems. In AFM chains, this field coexists with the non-transverse factorizing field ${h}'_s$ associated with a degenerate N\'eel-type separable GS \cite{Ku.82}, which is shown to arise at a level crossing in a finite chain. It is also demonstrated for arbitrary spin that pairwise entanglement reaches full range in the vicinity of both ${h}_s$ and ${h}'_s$, vanishing linearly at ${h}_s$ but approaching small yet finite side-limits at ${h}'_s$, which are analytically determined.

abstract: It was recently shown by Motes, Gilchrist, Dowling & Rohde [PRL 113, 120501 (2014)] that a time-bin encoded fiber-loop architecture can implement an arbitrary passive linear optics transformation. This was shown in the case of an ideal scheme whereby the architecture has no sources of error. In any realistic implementation, however, physical errors are present, which corrupt the output of the transformation. We investigate the dominant sources of error in this architecture --- loss and mode-mismatch --- and consider how it affects the BosonSampling protocol, a key application for passive linear optics. For our loss analysis we consider two major components that contribute to loss --- fiber and switches --- and calculate how this affects the success probability and fidelity of the device. Interestingly, we find that errors due to loss are not uniform (unique to time-bin encoding), which asymmetrically biases the implemented unitary. Thus, loss necessarily limits the class of unitaries that may be implemented, and therefore future implementations must prioritise minimising loss rates if arbitrary unitaries are to be implemented. Our formalism for mode-mismatch is generlized to account for various phenomenon that may cause mode-mismatch, but we focus on two --- errors in fiber-loop lengths, and time-jitter of the photon source. These results provide a guideline for how well future experimental implementations might perform in light of these error mechanisms.

abstract: Robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task in the development of practical quantum technology. In this paper, we present a systematic numerical methodology of sampling-based learning control (SLC) for control design of quantum systems with uncertainties. The SLC method includes two steps of "training" and "testing". In the training step, an augmented system is constructed using artificial samples generated by sampling uncertainty parameters according to a given distribution. A gradient flow based learning algorithm is developed to find the control for the augmented system. In the process of testing, a number of additional samples are tested to evaluate the control performance where these samples are obtained through sampling the uncertainty parameters according to a possible distribution. The SLC method is applied to three significant examples of quantum robust control including state preparation in a three-level quantum system, robust entanglement generation in a two-qubit superconducting circuit and quantum entanglement control in a two-atom system interacting with a quantized field in a cavity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLC approach even when uncertainties are quite large, and show its potential for robust control design of quantum systems.

abstract: Blind quantum machine learning (BQML) enables a classical client with little quantum technology to delegate a remote quantum machine learning to the quantum server in such a approach that the privacy data is preserved. Here we propose the first BQML protocol that the client can classify two-dimensional vectors to different clusters, resorting to a remote small-scale photon quantum computation processor. During the protocol, the client is only required to rotate and measure the single qubit. The protocol is secure without leaking any relevant information to the Eve. Any eavesdropper who attempts to intercept and disturb the learning process can be noticed. In principle, this protocol can be used to classify high dimensional vectors and may provide a new viewpoint and application for quantum machine learning.

abstract: Concordant computation is a circuit-based model of quantum computation for mixed states, that assumes that all correlations within the register are discord-free (i.e. the correlations are essentially classical) at every step of the computation. The question of whether concordant computation always admits efficient simulation by a classical computer was first considered by B. Eastin in quant-ph/1006.4402v1, where an answer in the affirmative was given for circuits consisting only of one- and two-qubit gates. Building on this work, we develop the theory of classical simulation of concordant computation. We present a new framework for understanding such computations, argue that a larger class of concordant computations admit efficient simulation, and provide alternative proofs for the main results of quant-ph/1006.4402v1 with an emphasis on the exactness of simulation which is crucial for this model. We include detailed analysis of the arithmetic complexity for solving equations in the simulation, as well as extensions to larger gates and qudits. We explore the limitations of our approach, and discuss the challenges faced in developing efficient classical simulation algorithms for all concordant computations.

abstract: The wave function transformation of the quantum particle considered as a continuous medium was described by the evolution operator with the kernel in the form of path integral. It is shown that this approach allows considering not only Schrodinger evolution, but and the collapse phenomenon. The collapse entity is the nonlocal transformation of the quantum particle internal structure and it is not connected with its mechanical motion. Probably this fact allows the instantaneous signalling using the collapse without violating relativistic requirements.

abstract: We introduce the concept of entanglement width as measure of the spatial distribution of entanglement in multiparticle systems. We develop criteria to detect the width of entanglement using global observables such as energy and magnetic susceptibility. Therefore, the introduced entanglement criteria can be applied to systems where addressing of single particles is not possible. We apply the criteria to different examples such as the J1-J2- Heisenberg model and point out the difference between entanglement depth and entanglement width.

abstract: Dynamical decoupling has been actively investigated since Viola first suggested using a pulse sequence to protect a qubit from decoherence. Since then, many schemes of dynamical decoupling have been proposed to achieve high-order suppression, both analytically and numerically. However, hitherto, there has not been a systematic framework to understand all existing uniform $\pi$-pulse dynamical decoupling schemes. In this report, we use the projection pulse sequences as basic building blocks and concatenation as a way to combine them. We derived a new concatenated-projection dynamical decoupling (CPDD), a framework in which we can systematically construct pulse sequences to achieve arbitrary high suppression order. All previously known uniform dynamical decoupling sequences using $\pi$ pulse can be fit into this framework. Understanding uniform dynamical decoupling as successive projections on the Hamiltonian will also give insights on how to invent new ways to construct better pulse sequences.

abstract: Entangled continuous variable (CV) Gaussian states with different wavelengths plays a central role in recent CV-based approaches to quantum network, quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Typically, experiments demonstrating CV entanglement exploit the optical parametric frequency down conversion. Due to the probabilistic nature of photon pair generation, the entanglement involving the post-selection of photonic qubits is limited to at most three colors. Here We theoretically present a scheme for the deterministic generation of entanglement among bright multicolor CV Gaussian states from an optomechanical system using existing experimental technologies. In our scheme an optical frequency comb is input into an optomechanical resonator and then the amplified optomechanical coupling makes multipartite entanglement among them. Our scheme overcomes the limitation of usable frequency of entangled CVs in frequency conversion process. It can be extended to generate multipartite entanglement between orthogonal modes with a single frequency or between microwave and optical CVs, or even among a microwave frequency comb. This optomechanical device can be integrated on a chip.

abstract: Ultracold gases promise many applications in quantum metrology, simulation and computation. In this context, optimal control theory (OCT) provides a versatile framework for the efficient preparation of complex quantum states. However, due to the high computational cost, OCT of ultracold gases has so far mostly been applied to one-dimensional (1D) problems. Here, we realize computationally efficient OCT of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) to manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates in all three spatial dimensions. We study various realistic experimental applications where 1D simulations can only be applied approximately or not at all. Moreover, we provide a stringent mathematical footing for our scheme and carefully study the creation of elementary excitations and their minimization using multiple control parameters. The results are directly applicable to recent experiments and might thus be of immediate use in the ongoing effort to employ the properties of the quantum world for technological applications.

abstract: We investigate, within the weak measurement theory, the advantages of non-classical pointer states over semi-classical ones for coherent, squeezed vacuum, and Schr\"{o}inger cat states. These states are utilized as pointer state for the system operator $\hat{A}$ with property $\hat{A}^{2}=\hat{I}$, where $\hat{I}$ represents the identity operator. We calculate the ratio between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of non-postselected and postselected weak measurements. The latter is used to find the quantum Fisher information for the above pointer states. The average shifts for those pointer states with arbitrary interaction strength are investigated in detail. One key result is that we find the postselected weak measurement scheme for non-classical pointer states to be superior to semi-classical ones. This can improve the precision of measurement process.

abstract: Genuine multipartite nonlocality is a salient feature of quantum systems, empowering the security of multi-party device independent cryptographic protocols. Given a correlation, characterizing and detecting genuineness have been subjected to recent studies. In this regard, we propose a Hardy-type argument which is able to detect genuine $n$-way nonlocality of arbitrary quantum systems. To understand the strength of this argument we also study the optimal success probability of the argument in a minimally constrained theory, namely the generalized no-signaling theory.

abstract: Thouless's quantum adiabatic pumping is of fundamental interest to condensed-matter physics. It originally considered a zero-temperature equilibrium state uniformly occupying all the bands below a Fermi surface. In the light of recent direct simulations of Thouless's concept in cold-atom systems, this work investigates the dynamics of quantum adiabatic pumping subject to dephasing, for rather general initial states with nonuniform populations and possibly interband coherence. Using a theory based on pure-dephasing Lindblad evolution, we find that the pumping is contributed by two parts of different nature, a dephasing-modified geometric part weighted by initial Bloch state populations, and an interband-coherence-induced part compromised by dephasing, both of them being independent of the pumping time scale. The overall pumping reflects an interplay of the band topology, initial state populations, initial state coherence, and dephasing. Theoretical results are carefully checked in a Chern insulator model coupled to a pure-dephasing environment, providing a useful starting point to understand and coherently control quantum adiabatic pumping in general situations.

abstract: Are there two-player games in which a strategy pair can exist as a Nash equilibrium only when the game is played quantum mechanically? To find an answer to this question, we study two-player games that are played in generalized Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen setting. Considering particular strategy pairs, we identify sets of games for which the pair can exist as a Nash equilibrium when Bell's inequality is violated. We thus identify games and players' strategies for which the Nash inequality becomes equivalent to Bell's inequality. As the violation of Bell's inequality is regarded as being quantum in nature, this paper thus addresses the earliest criticisms of quantum games that questioned if they were truly quantum.

abstract: A practical scheme for the demonstration of perfect one-sided device-independent quantum secret sharing is proposed. The scheme involves a three-mode optomechanical system in which a pair of independent cavity modes is driven by short laser pulses and interact with a movable mirror. We demonstrate that by tuning the laser frequency to the blue (anti-Stokes) sideband of the average frequency of the cavity modes, the modes become mutually coherent and then may collectively steer the mirror mode to a perfect Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state. The scheme is shown to be experimentally feasible, it is robust against the frequency difference between the modes, mechanical thermal noise and damping, and coupling strengths of the cavity modes to the mirror.

abstract: In study of the entanglement in a spin chain, people often consider the nearest-neighbor spins. The motivation is the prevailing role of the short range interactions in creating quantum correlation between 1st neighbor (1N) spins. Here, we address the same question between further neighbor spins. We consider the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 XX model in a transverse magnetic field (TF). Using the fermionization approach, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian of the system. Then, we provide the analytical results for the entanglement between the 2nd, 3rd and 4th neighbor (denoted as 2N, 3N, and 4N respectively) spins. We find a magnetic entanglement that starts from a critical entangled-field ($h_c^{E}$) at zero temperature. The critical entangled-field depends on the distance between the spins. In addition to the analytical results, the mentioned phenomenon is confirmed by the numerical Lanczos calculations. In the presence of the temperature, the magnetic entanglement remains stable up to a critical temperature, $T_c$. Our results show that the entanglement step by step spreads to the further neighbors in the spin chain by reducing the temperature. At first, 1N spins will be entangled and then further neighbors will be entangled respectively. $T_c$ depends on the value of the TF and will be maximized at the quantum critical TF.

abstract: Many numerical techniques for the description of quantum systems that are coupled to a continuous bath require the discretization of the latter. To this end, a wealth of methods has been developed in the literature, which we classify as (i) direct discretization, (ii) orthogonal polynomial, and (iii) numerical optimization strategies. We recapitulate strategies (i) and (ii) to clarify their relation. For quadratic Hamiltonians, we show that (ii) is the best strategy in the sense that it gives the numerically exact time evolution up to a maximum time $t_\text{max}$, for which we give a simple expression. For non-quadratic Hamiltonians, we show that no such best strategy exists. We present numerical examples relevant to open quantum systems and strongly correlated systems, as treated by dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).

abstract: We theoretically investigate the entangled states of an atomic ensemble that can be obtained via cavity-feedback, varying the atom-light coupling from weak to strong, and including a systematic treatment of decoherence. In the strong coupling regime for small atomic ensembles, the system is driven by cavity losses into a long-lived, highly-entangled many-body state that we characterize analytically. In the weak coupling regime for large ensembles, we find analytically the maximum spin squeezing that can be achieved by optimizing both the coupling and the atom number. This squeezing is fundamentally limited by spontaneous emission to a constant value, independent of the atom number. Harnessing entanglement in many-body systems is of fundamental interest [1] and is the key requirement for quantum enhanced technologies, in particular quantum metrology [2]. In this respect, many efforts have been devoted to prepare entangled states in atomic ensembles because of their high degree of coherence and their potential for precision measurement. Spin squeezed states as well as number states have been produced following methods based either on coherent evolution in the presence of a non-linearity in the atomic field [3--5], or on quantum non-demolition measurement [6--8]. Among methods of the first kind, cavity feedback [5, 9] is one of the most promising: it has already allowed for the creation of highly squeezed states [5] and the effective non-linearity introduced by the atom-cavity coupling can be easily switched off, making it very attractive for metrol-ogy applications. In this Letter, we analyze the entangled states that can be produced by cavity feedback in different coupling regimes from weak to strong, and derive the ultimate limits of the metrology gain, extending the optimization of squeezing to unexplored domains of parameters values. After optimization of both the coupling strength and the atom number, we find a maximum squeezing limit that depends only on the atomic structure.

abstract: A central theme in quantum mechanics is nonlocality, which states that a pair of quantum systems which are shown not to be physically interacting may nevertheless be impossible to describe as independent entities. Quantum theory, however, forbids nonlocal correlations beyond a certain limit. Why is nature only so nonlocal and not more? Approaching the question from the direction of statistics and statistical inference, we identify a statistical no-signaling principle which states that no information may pass through a disconnected channel. We show this principle to be equivalent to the Tsirelson bound on nonlocality for the Bell--CHSH inequality.

abstract: We study and extend the semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchies introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 020501] for the characterization of the statistical correlations arising from finite dimensional quantum systems. First, we introduce the dimension-constrained noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) paradigm, where a number of polynomial inequalities are defined and optimization is conducted over all feasible operator representations of bounded dimensionality. Important problems in device independent and semi-device independent quantum information science can be formulated (or almost formulated) in this framework. We present effective SDP hierarchies to attack the general dimension-constrained NPO problem (and related ones) and prove their asymptotic convergence. To illustrate the power of these relaxations, we use them to derive new dimension witnesses for temporal and Bell-type correlation scenarios, and also to bound the probability of success of quantum random access codes.

abstract: A randomly walking quantum particle evolving by Schr\"odinger's equation searches for a unique marked vertex on the "simplex of complete graphs" in time $\Theta(N^{3/4})$. In this paper, we give a weighted version of this graph that preserves vertex-transitivity, and we show that the time to search on it can be reduced to nearly $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$. To prove this, we introduce two novel extensions to degenerate perturbation theory: an adjustment that distinguishes the weights of the edges, and a method to determine how precisely the jumping rate of the quantum walk must be chosen.

abstract: The problem of estimating a parameter of a quantum system through a series of measurements performed sequentially on a quantum probe is analyzed in the general setting where the underlying statistics is explicitly non-i.i.d. We present a generalization of the central limit theorem in the present context, which under fairly general assumptions shows that as the number $N$ of measurement data increases the probability distribution of functionals of the data (e.g., the average of the data) through which the target parameter is estimated becomes asymptotically normal and independent of the initial state of the probe. At variance with the previous study [M. Gu\c{t}\u{a}, Phys. Rev. A 83, 062324 (2011)] we take a diagrammatic approach, which allows one to compute not only the leading orders in $N$ of the moments of the average of the data but also those of the correlations among subsequent measurement outcomes. In particular our analysis points out that the latter, which are not available in usual i.i.d. data, can be exploited in order to improve the accuracy of the parameter estimation. An explicit application of our scheme is discussed by studying how the temperature of a thermal reservoir can be estimated via sequential measurements on a quantum probe in contact with the reservoir.

While both properties are lost due to decoherence, we show that macroscopicity is rare in uniform and in so-called random physical ensembles of pure quantum states, despite possibly large geometric entanglement. In contrast, permutation-symmetric pure states feature rather low geometric entanglement and strong and robust macroscopicity.

abstract: Developing efficient and reliable schemes for practical quantum measurements is of essential importance to quantum information science and quantum metrology. In this work, for the increasingly important superconducting circuit-QED setup, we present a rigorous approach starting with the quantum trajectory equation (QTE) to establish an {\it exact} quantum Bayesian rule. For the "realistic" back-action (no qubit state information gain), we obtain important correction factors for arbitrary setup parameters. For the "spooky" information gain back-action, we establish new prior distribution knowledge for the Bayesian inference, which differ from the standard Gaussian distribution and ensure to give strictly the same results as that by numerically integrating the QTE. Compared to the QTE approach, while keeping the same accuracy, the obtained quantum Bayesian rule has much higher efficiency to compute the stochastic change of the measured state. The generic method of this work opens also a new way to construct exact quantum Bayesian rules for quantum measurement in other systems.

abstract: We study the remote creation of the polarization and intensity of the first-order coherence (or coherence intensity) in long spin-1/2 chains with one qubit sender and receiver. Therewith we use a physically motivated initial condition with the pure state of the sender and the thermodynamical equilibrium state of the rest nodes. The main part of the creatable region is one-to-one map of the initial state (control) parameters, except for the small subregion twice covered by the control parameters, which appears owing to the chosen initial state. The polarization and coherence intensity behave differently in the state creation process. In particular, the latter can not be valuable without polarization in long chain (unlike the short ones), but the opposite is not true. The coherence intensity vanishes with increase in the chain length, while the polarization (by absolute value) is not sensitive to this parameter. We represent several characteristics of the creatable polarization and coherence intensity, and describe their relation to the parameters of the initial state. The link to the eigenvalue-eigenvector parametrization of the receiver's state-space is given.

abstract: The symmetry of quantum theory under time reversal has long been a subject of controversy because the transition probabilities given by Born's rule do not apply backward in time. Here, we resolve this problem within a rigorous operational probabilistic framework. We argue that reconciling time reversal with the probabilistic rules of the theory requires a notion of operation that permits realizations via both pre- and post-selection. We develop the generalized formulation of quantum theory that stems from this approach and give a precise definition of time-reversal symmetry, emphasizing a previously overlooked distinction between states and effects. We prove an analogue of Wigner's theorem, which characterizes all allowed symmetry transformations in this operationally time-symmetric quantum theory. Remarkably, we find larger classes of symmetry transformations than those assumed before. This suggests a possible direction for search of extensions of known physics.

abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an ion sympathetically cooled by another laser-cooled ion or small ion crystal. To this end, we develop simple models of the cooling dynamics in the limit of weak Coulomb interactions. Experimentally, we create a two-ion crystal of Ca$^+$ and Al$^+$ by photo-ionization of neutral atoms produced by laser ablation. We characterize the velocity distribution of the laser-ablated atoms crossing the trap by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. We observe neutral atom velocities much higher than the ones of thermally heated samples and find as a consequence long sympathethic cooling times before crystallization occurs. Our key result is a new technique for detecting the loading of an initially hot ion with energy in the eV range by monitoring the motional state of a Doppler-cooled ion already present in the trap. This technique not only detects the ion but also provides information about dynamics of the sympathetic cooling process.

abstract: We present a bouquet of continuity bounds for quantum entropies, falling broadly into two classes: First, a tight analysis of the Alicki-Fannes continuity bounds for the conditional von Neumann entropy, reaching almost the best possible form that depends only on the system dimension and the trace distance of the states. Almost the same proof can be used to derive similar continuity bounds for the relative entropy distance from a convex set of states or positive operators. As an application we prove asymptotic continuity of the regularized relative entropy of entanglement, $E_R^\infty$. Second, analogous continuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and conditional entropy in infinite dimensional systems under an energy constraint, most importantly systems of multiple quantum harmonic oscillators. While without an energy bound the entropy is discontinuous, it is well-known to be continuous on states of bounded energy. However, a quantitative statement to that effect seems not to have been known. Here, under some regularity assumptions on the Hamiltonian, we find that, quite intuitively, the Gibbs entropy at the given energy roughly takes the role of the Hilbert space dimension in the finite-dimensional Fannes inequality.

abstract: Quantum metrology is the state-of-the-art measurement technology. It uses quantum resources to enhance the sensitivity of phase estimation beyond what reachable within classical physics. While single parameter estimation theory has been widely investigated, much less is known about the simultaneous estimation of multiple phases, which finds key applications in imaging and sensing. In this manuscript we provide conditions of useful entanglement (among multimode particles, qudits) for multiphase estimation and adapt them to multiarm Mach-Zehnder interferometry. We discuss benchmark multimode Fock states containing useful qudit entanglement and overcoming the sensitivity of separable qudit states in three and four arm Mach-Zehnder-like interferometers - currently within the reach of integrated photonics technology.

abstract: The Wigner distribution function is a quasi-probability distribution. When properly integrated, it provides the correct charge and current densities, but it gives negative probabilities in some points and regions of the phase space. Alternatively, the Husimi distribution function is positive-defined everywhere, but it does not provide the correct charge and current densities. The origin of all these difficulties is the attempt to construct a phase space within a quantum theory that does not allow well-defined (i.e. simultaneous) values of the position and momentum of an electron. In contrast, within the (de Broglie-Bohm) Bohmian theory of quantum mechanics, an electron has well-defined position and momentum. Therefore, such theory provides a natural definition of the phase space probability distribution and by construction, it is positive-defined and it exactly reproduces the charge and current densities. The Bohmian distribution function has many potentialities for quantum problems, in general, and for quantum transport, in particular, that remains unexplored.

abstract: Nonclassicality is a key ingredient for quantum enhanced technologies and experiments involving macro- scopic quantum coherence. Considering various exactly-solvable quantum-oscillator systems, we address the role played by the anharmonicity of their potential in the establishment of nonclassical features. Specifically, we show that a monotonic relation exists between the the entropic nonlinearity of the considered potentials and their ground state nonclassicality, as quantified by the negativity of the Wigner function. In addition, in order to clarify the role of squeezing--which is not captured by the negativity of the Wigner function--we focus on the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function and address the nonclassicality/nonlinearity relation using the entanglement potential. Finally, we consider the case of a generic sixth-order potential confirming the idea that nonlinearity is a resource for the generation of nonclassicality and may serve as a guideline for the engineering of quantum oscillators.

abstract: Quantum repeaters promise to enable quantum networks over global distances by circumventing the exponential decrease in success probability inherent in direct photon transmission. We propose a realistic, functionally integrated quantum repeater implementation based on single atoms in optical cavities. Entanglement is directly generated between the single-atom quantum memory and a photon at telecom wavelength. The latter is collected with high efficiency and adjustable temporal and spectral properties into a spatially well-defined cavity mode. It is heralded by a near-infrared photon emitted from a second, orthogonal cavity. Entanglement between two remote quantum memories can be generated via an optical Bell-state measurement, while we propose entanglement swapping based on a highly efficient, cavity-assisted atom-atom gate. Our quantum repeater scheme eliminates any requirement for wavelength conversion such that only a single system is needed at each node. We investigate a particular implementation with rubidium and realistic parameters for Fabry-Perot cavities based on CO$_2$ laser-machined optical fibers. We show that the scheme enables the implementation of a rather simple quantum repeater that outperforms direct entanglement generation over large distances and does not require any improvements in technology beyond the state of the art.

abstract: We study the topological properties of the quantum phase space current in the Husimi representation, focusing on the dynamical differences, induced by these properties, between the quantum and the classical flows. We show that the zeros of the Husimi function are stagnation points of the current and have a nonzero topological charge. Due to overall charge conservation, new stagnation points with opposite charge appear in pairs in the Husimi current and they have important roles in dynamical processes. As an example we show the topological effect of the zeros in the transmission rate of particle through a potential barrier.

abstract: We describe a connection between entanglement and designs. It involves the conical 2-designs introduced in a previous paper. These are a generalization of projective 2-designs which includes full sets of arbitrary rank mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) and arbitrary rank symmetric informationally complete measurements (SIMs), as well as the more familiar MUBs and SICs. We show that a POVM is a conical 2-design if and only if there exists what we call a regular entanglement monotone whose restriction to the pure states is a function of the norm of the probability vector. In that case the concurrence is such a monotone. We also generalize and develop previous work on designs and entanglement detection.

abstract: Methods of quantum mechanics promise information-theoretic security for various protocols in cryptography. However, impossibility of some cryptographic applications such as standard bit commitment, oblivious transfer, multiparty secure computations and ideal coin tossing in quantum regime leaves an obvious question on the completeness of quantum cryptography. Instead of using wide range of rules and techniques for a variety of cryptographic applications, we demonstrate here a unified structure for quantum cryptography based on quantum non-local correlations. The unified framework achieves same goals in information-theoretic way as classical cryptography does with computational hardness. To cover the broad range of cryptographic applications, we show that the framework (i) assures secrecy by providing encryption completely unintelligible to eavesdroppers, (ii) guarantees that input from distant parties is concealed unless they are willing to reveal, (iii) assures binding, (iv) allows splitting information between several parties securely and more generally, (v) evades both quantum and classical attacks from internal as well as external eavesdropping.

abstract: Plasmonics is a rapidly emerging platform for quantum state engineering with the potential for building ultra-compact and hybrid optoelectronic devices. Recent experiments have shown that despite the presence of decoherence and loss, photon statistics and entanglement can be preserved in single plasmonic systems. This preserving ability should carry over to plasmonic metamaterials, whose properties are the result of many individual plasmonic systems acting collectively, and can be used to engineer optical states of light. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of quantum state filtering, also known as entanglement distillation, using a metamaterial. We show that the metamaterial can be used to distill highly entangled states from less entangled states. As the metamaterial can be integrated with other optical components this work opens up the intriguing possibility of incorporating plasmonic metamaterials in on-chip quantum state engineering tasks.

abstract: General key problems in relation to the application of self-organizing structures theory to the analysis of current cooperative phenomena are discussed. Particularly, we present the new results of the analysis of burning problem to form a qubit network. Recently [Proc. of the Inst. of Physics and Technol. of Russian Acad. of Sci. (Trudy FTIAN), vol. 25 (accepted for publication on Jan. 15, 2015)] we have proposed a new method for quantum computer implementation based on self-organizing structures. Here we consider in detail the essence of new proposals and theoretical argumentation. We have shown that some self-organizing structures, both dissipative ones and thermodynamically equilibrium structures with off-diagonal long-range order, are promising to form a qubit network. This is confirmed by our results of the investigations relative to the following items: an open resonator with periodic boundaries, conditions to create specific distribution of the modes and the effect of the field crystallization, the use of this effect to create an proficient and coherentized system of neutral atoms traps and to achieve their precise localization; the equilibrium systems which can go, at temperatures below critical ones, into the special state with off-diagonal long-range order (i.e. to the state with macroscopic quantum coherence), phase transition (photons condensation) in the two-level atoms interacting with radiation mode in the resonator, superradiant phase transition, the order-disorder type ferroelectrics in the cavity electromagnetic field, the advantage of the systems capable to self-organization, including the suppression of the temperature influence as the decoherence factor acting on the work states of the qubits (atoms, ferroelectric molecules), and also the coherent character of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between qubits (in the case of ferroelectrics), and other items.

abstract: We present a theoretical proposal to couple a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center to a superconducting flux qubit (FQ) in the regime where both systems are off resonance. The coupling between both quantum devices is achieved through the strong driving of the flux qubit by a classical microwave field that creates dressed states with an experimentally controlled characteristic frequency. We discuss several applications such as controlling the NV center's state by manipulation of the flux qubit, performing the NV center full tomography and using the NV center as a quantum memory. The effect of decoherence and its consequences to the proposed applications are also analyzed. Our results provide a theoretical framework describing a promising hybrid system for quantum information processing, which combines the advantages of fast manipulation and long coherence times.

abstract: While quantum coherence is usually a goal to achieve, transfer, and maintain in quantum systems out of chaos, it has recently become a center of attention as a resource for thermalization. There are many coherences in a given many body quantum system. Our purpose is to distinguish coherences which can contribute to pure thermalization. For that aim, we consider a three atom quantum thermalizing machine for a single mode cavity. Deriving the master equation and solving it in the steady state for a general initial state of the atoms, we examine the interplay of coherence and detailed balance for thermalization of the cavity field. We find that the atomic coherences can be classified into disjoint sets with purely thermal and coherent contributions. Possibility to turn the atoms into pure, coherent, or squeezed thermal reservoirs is shown. As applications of the general formalism, the symmetric W state is shown to be the most optimum thermalizing state among all W-class states, whereas GHZ state is not suitable for thermalization, which is another fundamental difference between the two distinct classes of three atom entangled states emerging in the realm of quantum thermodynamics. Furthremore, we propose a mixture of W states that can utilize all the allowed coherences for pure thermalization to ultrahigh temperatures.

abstract: We study a quantum mechanical system consisting of up to three identical dipoles confined to move along a helical shaped trap. The long-range interactions between particles confined to move in this one dimension leads to an interesting effective two-particle potential with an oscillating behaviour. For this system we calculate the spectrum and the wave functions of the bound states. The full quantum solutions show clear imprints of the tendency for the system to form chains of dipoles along the helix, i.e. a configuration in which the dipoles are sitting approximately one winding of the helix apart so that they can take maximal advantage of the strong head-to-tail attraction that is a generic feature of the dipole-dipole interaction.

abstract: We introduce and study the task of assisted coherence distillation. This task arises naturally in bipartite systems where both parties work together to generate the maximal possible coherence on one of the subsystems. Only incoherent operations are allowed on the target system while general local quantum operations are permitted on the other, an operational paradigm that we call local quantum-incoherent operations and classical communication (LQICC). We show that the asymptotic rate of assisted coherence distillation for pure states is equal to the coherence of assistance, a direct analog of the entanglement of assistance, whose properties we characterize. Our findings imply a novel interpretation of the von Neumann entropy: it quantifies the maximum amount of extra quantum coherence a system can gain when receiving assistance from a collaborative party. Our results are generalized to coherence localization in a multipartite setting and possible applications are discussed.

In particular, we focus on the universality problem of an $m$-mode beamsplitter. Using methods of control theory and some properties of rotations in three dimensions, we prove that any nontrivial real 2-mode and "almost" any nontrivial real $3$-mode beamsplitter is universal on $m\geq3$ modes.

abstract: The effect of boundary deformation on the non-separable entanglement which appears in the classical elec- tromagnetic field is considered. A quantum chaotic billiard geometry is used to explore the influence of a mechanical modification of the optical fiber cross-sectional geometry on the production of non-separable entan- glement within classical fields. For the experimental realization of our idea, we propose an optical fiber with a cross section that belongs to the family of Robnik chaotic billiards. Our results show that a modification of the fiber geometry from a regular to a chaotic regime can enhance the transverse mode entanglement. Our proposal can be realized in a very simple experimental set-up which consists of a specially designed optical fiber where non-entangled light enters at the input end and entangled light propagates out at the output end after interacting with a fiber boundary that is known to generate chaotic behavior.

abstract: Models of areas of physics in terms of cellular automata have become increasingly popular. Cellular automata (CAs) support the modeling of systems with discrete state component values and enforce the comprehensive specification of the dynamic evolution of such systems. Because many areas of physics can be described by starting with a specific Lagrangian, the idea to derive a cellular automaton directly from the Lagrangian (or similar construct, such as the Hamiltonian or action) is not new. Previous work, however, indicated that the classical CA may not be a sufficient basis for the modeling of more advanced physics theories, such as quantum field theory. Specifically, the modeling of interactions in quantum field theory requires extensions and modifications of the classical CA. This paper describes a proposal for an extended cellular automaton that is suited for support of quantum field theory.

abstract: The general Dirac equation in 1+1 dimensions with a potential with a completely general Lorentz structure is studied. The states of relativistic fermions embedded in mixed vector-scalar-pseudoscalar square potentials are investigated. This relativistic problem can be mapped into a effective Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a square potential with repulsive and attractive delta-functions situaded at the borders. An oscillatory transmission coefficient is found and resonant state energies are obtained. In a special case, the same bound energy spectrum for spinless particles is obtained, confirming the predictions of literature. We showed that existence of bound-state solutions are conditioned by the intensity of the pseudoscalar potential, which posses a critical value.

abstract: We investigate how entanglement spreads along small Bose-Hubbard chains, with only the first well initially occupied by a mesoscopic number of atoms, as the number of sites increases. For two- and three-well chains in the non-interacting case, we are able to obtain analytical solutions and show that the presence of entanglement depends on having a sub-Poissonian state of the atoms in the first well. In these cases, the correlations we calculate are completely periodic. Restoring the collisional interactions or moving to a four-well chain necessitates a numerical treatment, for which we use the fully quantum positive-P representation. We examine two different correlations and find that adding collisional interactions destroys the periodicity of the correlations and causes them to degrade with time. This happens well before there is a noticeable effect on the periodicity of the solutions for the number of atoms in each well.

abstract: This Report explores recent advances in our understanding of the physics of open quantum systems (OQSs) which consist of some localized region that is coupled to an external environment. Examples of such systems may be found in numerous areas of physics including mesoscopic physics that provides the main focus of this review. We provide a detailed discussion of the behavior of OQSs in terms of the projection-operator formalism, according to which the system under study is considered to be comprised of a localized region ($Q$), embedded into a well-defined environment ($P$) of scattering wavefunctions (with $Q+P=1$). The $Q$ subspace must be treated using the concepts of non-Hermitian physics, and of particular interest here is: the capacity of the environment to mediate a coupling between the different states of $Q$; the role played by the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectra of OQSs; the influence of EPs on the rigidity of the wavefunction phases, and; the ability of EPs to initiate a dynamical phase transition (DPT). DPTs occur when the quantum dynamics of the open system causes transitions between non-analytically connected states, as a function of some external control parameter. In addition to discussing experiments on mesoscopic quantum point contacts, we also review manifestations of DPTs in mesoscopic devices and other systems. Other possible manifestations of this phenomenon are presented. From these discussions a generic picture of OQSs emerges in which the environmentally-mediated coupling between different quantum states plays a critical role in governing the system behavior.

abstract: Quantum nonlocality can be revealed "via local contextuality" in qudit-qudit entangled systems with $d > 2$, that is, through the violation of inequalities containing only Alice-Bob correlations that admit a local description, and Alice-Alice correlations (between the results of sequences of measurements on Alice's subsystem) that admit a local (but contextual) description. A fundamental question to understand the respective roles of entanglement and local contextuality is whether nonlocality via local contextuality exists when the parties have only qubit-qubit entanglement. Here we respond affirmatively to this question. This result further clarifies the connection between contextuality and nonlocality and opens the door for observing nonlocality via local contextuality in actual experiments.

abstract: In this paper we provide a broad framework for describing learning agents in general quantum environments. We analyze the types of classically specified environments which allow for quantum enhancements in learning, by contrasting environments to quantum oracles. We show that whether or not quantum improvements are at all possible depends on the internal structure of the quantum environment. If the environments are constructed and the internal structure is appropriately chosen, or if the agent has limited capacities to influence the internal states of the environment, we show that improvements in learning times are possible in a broad range of scenarios. Such scenarios we call luck-favoring settings. The case of constructed environments is particularly relevant for the class of model-based learning agents, where our results imply a near-generic improvement.

abstract: We analyze the Stern-Gerlach experiment in phase space with the help of the matrix Wigner function, which includes the spin degree of freedom. Such analysis allows for an intuitive visualization of the quantum dynamics of the apparatus. We include the interaction with the environment, as described by the Caldeira-Leggett model. The diagonal terms of the matrix provide us with information about the two components of the state, that arise from interaction with the magnetic field gradient. In particular, from the marginals of these components, we obtain an analytical formula for the position and momentum probability distributions in presence of decoherence, that show a diffusive behavior for large values of the decoherence parameter. These features limit the dynamics of the present model. We also observe the decay of the non-diagonal terms with time, and use this fact to quantify the amount of decoherence, from the norm of those terms in phase space. From here, we can define a decoherence time scale, which differs from previous results that make use of the same model.

abstract: We consider a model quantum field theory with a scalar quantum field in de Sitter space-time in a Bohmian version with a field ontology, i.e., an actual field configuration $\varphi({\bf x},t)$ guided by a wave function on the space of field configurations. We analyze the asymptotics at late times ($t\to\infty$) and provide reason to believe that for more or less any wave function and initial field configuration, every Fourier coefficient $\varphi_{\bf k}(t)$ of the field is asymptotically of the form $c_{\bf k}\sqrt{1+{\bf k}^2 \exp(-2Ht)/H^2}$, where the limiting coefficients $c_{\bf k}=\varphi_{\bf k}(\infty)$ are independent of $t$ and $H$ is the Hubble constant quantifying the expansion rate of de Sitter space-time. In particular, every field mode $\varphi_{\bf k}$ possesses a limit as $t\to\infty$ and thus "freezes." This result is relevant to the question whether Boltzmann brains form in the late universe according to this theory, and supports that they do not.

abstract: If a single-mode nonclassical light is combined with the vacuum on a beam splitter, then the output state is entangled. As proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 173602 (2005)], by measuring the output-state entanglement for a balanced lossless beam splitter, one can quantify the input-state nonclassicality. These measures of nonclassicality (referred to as entanglement potentials) can be based, in principle, on various entanglement measures, leading to the negativity (NP) and concurrence (CP) potentials, and the potential for the relative entropy of entanglement (REEP). We search for the maximal nonclassicality, which can be achieved by comparing two entanglement measures for arbitrary two-qubit states and those which can be generated from a photon-number qubit via a balanced lossless beam-splitter, where the qubit basis states are the vacuum and single-photon states. Surprisingly, we find that the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the REEP for a given value of the NP, can be increased (if NP<0.527) by using either a tunable beam splitter or by amplitude damping of the output state of the balanced beam splitter. We also show that the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the NP for a given value of the REEP, can be increased by dephasing. The entanglement itself is not increased by these local losses, but the possible ratios of different measures are affected. Moreover, we show that partially-mixed states can be more nonclassical than both pure states and completely-mixed states, by comparing the NP for a given value of the REEP. This implies that not all entanglement measures can be used as entanglement potentials. Alternatively, a single balanced lossless beam splitter is not always transferring the whole nonclassicality of its input state into the entanglement of its output modes. Applying a lossy beam splitter can solve this problem at least for the cases analyzed in this paper.

abstract: The development of efficient protocols for pure and mixed states preparation is challenging task. Most of the theory of quantum information applications has been developed for fully coherent or completely incoherent light. However, in many situations of interest partially coherent light has been proved to be a more robust model of radiation. In this paper the underpinning theory of two photon amplitude functions for down-converted fields with partially coherent pump beams is investigated. By using the generalised Siegert relations and the coherent mode representation of the cross spectral density matrix the two photon amplitude is fully characterised for partially coherent beams. A number of correlation properties from modern coherence theory are demonstrated to be preserved under parametric down-conversion. Based on the generalised Siegert relations and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality a measure of entanglement for the two photon amplitude is proposed. Upper bounds for this measure are found in terms of the \emph{golden ratio} for maximally entangled states. Two inequalities are derived for the two photon amplitude for which there exist a transition zone from super-Poisson statistics to sub-Poisson statistics for down-converted partially coherent fields.

abstract: Quantum steering refers to the possibility for Alice to remotely steer Bob's state by performing local measurements on her half of a bipartite system. Two necessary ingredients for steering are entanglement and incompatibility of Alice's measurements. In particular, it has been recently proven that for the case of pure states of maximal Schmidt rank the problem of steerability for Bob's assemblage is equivalent to the problem of joint measurability for Alice observables. We show that such an equivalence holds in general, namely, the steerability of any assemblage can always be formulated as a joint measurability problem, and vice versa. We use this connection to introduce steering inequalities from joint measurability criteria and develop quantifiers for the incompatibility of measurements.

abstract: Motivated by understanding the emergence of thermodynamic restoring forces and oscillations, we develop a quantum-mechanical model of a bath of spins coupled to the elasticity of a material. We show our model reproduces the behavior of a variety of entropic springs while enabling investigation of non-equilibrium resonator states in the quantum domain. We find our model emerges naturally in disordered elastic media such as glasses, and is an additional, expected effect in systems with anomalous specific heat and 1/f noise at low temperatures due to two-level systems that fluctuate.

abstract: We develop a scattering theory to investigate the multi-photon transmission in a one-dimensional waveguide in the presence of quantum emitters. It is based on a path integral formalism, uses displacement transformations, and does not require the Markov approximation. We obtain the full time-evolution of the global system, including the emitters and the photonic field. Our theory allows us to compute the transition amplitude between arbitrary initial and final states, as well as the S-matrix of the asymptotic in- and out- states. For the case of few incident photons in the waveguide, we also re-derive a generalized master equation in the Markov limit. We compare the predictions of the developed scattering theory and that with the Markov approximation. We illustrate our methods with five examples of few-photon scattering: (i) by a two-level emitter, (ii) in the Jaynes-Cummings model; (iii) by an array of two-level emitters; (iv) by a two-level emitter in the half-end waveguide; (v) by an array of atoms coupled to Rydberg levels. In the first two, we show the application of the scattering theory in the photon scattering by a single emitter, and examine the correctness of our theory with the well-known results. In the third example, we analyze the condition of the Markov approximation for the photon scattering in the array of emitters. In the forth one, we show how a quantum emitter can generate entanglement of out-going photons. Finally, we highlight the interplay between the phenomenon of electromagnetic-induced transparency and the Rydberg interaction, and show how this results in a rich variety of possibilities in the quantum statistics of the scattering photons.

abstract: The localized Hartree-Fock potential has proven to be a computationally efficient alternative to the optimized effective potential, preserving the numerical accuracy of the latter and respecting the exact properties of being self-interaction free and having the correct $-1/r$ asymptotics. In this paper we extend the localized Hartree-Fock potential to fractional particle numbers and observe that it yields derivative discontinuities in the energy as required by the exact theory. The discontinuities are numerically close to those of the computationally more demanding Hartree-Fock method. Our potential enjoys a "direct-energy" property, whereby the energy of the system is given by the sum of the single-particle eigenvalues multiplied by the corresponding occupation numbers. The discontinuities $c_\uparrow$ and $c_\downarrow$ of the spin-components of the potential at integer particle numbers $N_\uparrow$ and $N_\downarrow$ satisfy the condition $c_\uparrow N_\uparrow+c_\downarrow N_\downarrow=0$. Thus, joining the family of effective potentials which support a derivative discontinuity, but being considerably easier to implement, the localized Hartree-Fock potential becomes a powerful tool in the broad area of applications in which the fundamental gap is an issue.

abstract: Enhancing the polarization of nuclear spins surrounding the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has attracted widespread attention recently due to its various applications. Here we present an analytical theory and comprehensive understanding on how to optimize the dynamic nuclear polarization by an optically pumped NV center near the ground state level anticrossing. Our results not only provide a parameter-free explanation and a clearly physics picture for the recently observed polarization dependence on the magnetic field for strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclei [H. J. Wang \textit{et al}., Nat. Commun. 4, 1 (2013)], but also demonstrate the possibility to strongly polarize weakly coupled $^{13}$C nuclei under weak optical pumping and suitably chosen magnetic field. This allows sensitive magnetic control of the $^{13}$C nuclear spin polarization for NMR applications and significant suppression of the $^{13}$C nuclear spin noise to prolong the NV spin coherence time.

abstract: We present a concept of non-Gaussian measurement composed of a non-Gaussian ancillary state, linear optics and adaptive heterodyne measurement, and on the basis of this we also propose a simple scheme of implementing a quantum cubic gate on a traveling light beam. In analysis of the cubic gate in the Heisenberg representation, we find that nonlinearity of the gate is independent from nonclassicality; the nonlinearity is generated solely by a classical nonlinear adaptive control in a measurement-and-feedforward process while the nonclassicality is attached by the non-Gaussian ancilla that suppresses excess noise in the output. By exploiting the noise term as a figure of merit, we consider the optimum non-Gaussian ancilla that can be prepared within reach of current technologies and discuss performance of the gate. It is a crucial step towards experimental implementation of the quantum cubic gate.

abstract: The problems of optimizing the value of an arbitrary observable of the two-level system at both a fixed time and the shortest possible time is theoretically explored. Complete identification and classification along with comprehensive analysis of globally optimal control policies and traps (i.e. policies which are locally but not globally optimal) is presented. The central question addressed is whether the control landscape remains trap-free if control constraints of the inequality type are imposed. The answer is astonishingly controversial, namely, although formally it is always negative, in practice it is positive provided that the control time is fixed and chosen long enough.

abstract: We study quantum optics with the atoms coupled to the quantized electromagnetic (EM) field in a non-inertial reference frame by making use of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. We rigorously establish the microscopic model for a two-level atom interacting with the quantized EM field in a rotating ring cavity by deriving a Jaynes-Cummings (JC) type Hamiltonian. Due to the two fold degeneracy of the ring cavity modes, the Rabi splitting exhibits three rather than two resonant frequency peaks. We find that the heights of the two side peaks show a sensitive linear dependence on the rotating velocity. This high sensitivity can be utilized to detect the angular velocity of the whole system.

abstract: Tensor networks, and in particular Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), are a powerful tool for the study of quantum many body physics, thanks to both their built-in ability of classifying and studying symmetries, and the efficient numerical calculations they allow. In this work, we introduce a way to extend the set of symmetric PEPS in order to include local gauge invariance and investigate lattice gauge theories with fermionic matter. To this purpose, we provide as a case study and first example, the construction of a fermionic PEPS, based on Gaussian schemes, invariant under both global and local U(1) gauge transformations. The obtained states correspond to a truncated U(1) lattice gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, involving both the gauge field and fermionic matter. For the global symmetry (pure fermionic) case, these PEPS can be studied in terms of spinless fermions subject to a p-wave superconducting pairing. For the local symmetry (fermions and gauge fields) case, we find confined and deconfined phases in the pure gauge limit, and we discuss the screening properties of the phases arising in the presence of dynamical matter.

abstract: Quantum repeaters - fundamental building blocks for long-distance quantum communication - are based on the interaction between photons and quantum memories. The photons must fulfil stringent requirements on central frequency, spectral bandwidth and purity in order for this interaction to be efficient. We present a design scheme for monolithically integrated resonant photon-pair sources based on parametric down-conversion in nonlinear waveguides, which facilitate the generation of such photons. We investigate the impact of different design parameters on the performance of our source. The generated photon spectral bandwidths can be varied between several tens of MHz up to around $1\,$GHz, facilitating an efficient coupling to different memories. The central frequency of the generated photons can be coarsely tuned by adjusting the pump frequency, poling period and sample temperature and we identify stability requirements on the pump laser and sample temperature that can be readily fulfilled with off-the-shelve components. We find that our source is capable of generating high-purity photons over a wide range of photon bandwidths. Finally, the PDC emission can be frequency fine-tuned over several GHz by simultaneously adjusting the sample temperature and pump frequency. We conclude our study with demonstrating the adaptability of our source to different quantum memories.

abstract: Quantum computers are able to outperform classical algorithms. This was long recognized by the visionary Richard Feynman who pointed out in the 1980s that quantum mechanical problems were better solved with quantum machines. It was only in 1994 that Peter Shor came up with an algorithm that is able to calculate the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than known possible with a classical computer. This paradigmatic algorithm stimulated the flourishing research in quantum information processing and the quest for an actual implementation of a quantum computer. Over the last fifteen years, using skillful optimizations, several instances of a Shor algorithm have been implemented on various platforms and clearly proved the feasibility of quantum factoring. For general scalability, though, a different approach has to be pursued. Here, we report the realization of a fully scalable Shor algorithm as proposed by Kitaev. For this, we demonstrate factoring the number fifteen by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four "cache-qubits", together with the implementation of generalized arithmetic operations, known as modular multipliers. The scalable algorithm has been realized with an ion-trap quantum computer exhibiting success probabilities in excess of 90%.

abstract: We establish a direct connection of quantum Markovianity of an open quantum system to its classical counterpart by generalizing the criterion based on the information flow. Here, the flow is characterized by the time evolution of Helstrom matrices, given by the weighted difference of statistical operators, under the action of the quantum dynamical evolution. It turns out that the introduced criterion is equivalent to P-divisibility of a quantum process, namely divisibility in terms of positive maps, which provides a direct connection to classical Markovian stochastic processes. Moreover, it is shown that similar mathematical representations as those found for the original trace distance based measure hold true for the associated, generalized measure for quantum non-Markovianity. That is, we prove orthogonality of optimal states showing a maximal information backflow and establish a local and universal representation of the measure. We illustrate some properties of the generalized criterion by means of examples.

abstract: Light beams having a vectorial field structure - or polarization - that varies over the transverse profile and a central optical singularity are called vector-vortex (VV) beams and may exhibit specific properties, such as focusing into "light needles" or rotation invariance, with applications ranging from microscopy and light trapping to communication and metrology. Individual photons in such beams exhibit a form of single-particle quantum entanglement between different degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the quantum states of two photons can be also entangled with each other. Here we combine these two concepts and demonstrate the generation of quantum entanglement between two photons that are both in VV states - a new form of quantum "entangled entanglement". This result may lead to quantum-enhanced applications of VV beams as well as to quantum-information protocols fully exploiting the vectorial features of light.

abstract: Using the fact that any linear representation of a group can be embedded into permutations, we propose a constructive description of quantum behavior that provides, in particular, a natural explanation of appearance of complex numbers and unitarity in the formalism of quantum mechanics. In our approach, the quantum behavior can be explained by the fundamental impossibility to trace identity of indistinguishable objects in their evolution. Any observation only provides information about the invariant relations between such objects. The trajectory of a quantum system is a sequence of unitary evolutions interspersed with observations -- non-unitary projections. We suggest a scheme to construct combinatorial models of quantum evolution. The principle of selection of the most likely trajectories in such models via the large numbers approximation leads in the continuum limit to the principle of least action with the appropriate Lagrangians and deterministic evolution equations.

The electric and gravitational interaction for distribution with the spherical and cylindrical symmetries has been considered. A type of the potential and of the wave function corresponding with these solutions has been pointed out. It has been shown that the surface of the probability distribution function consists of the characteristics which are the classical mechanical trajectories. Accordingly, a detailed geometric interpretation of the classical and probabilistic description of the physical system has been shown.

abstract: Within the broad research scenario of quantum secure communication, Two-Way Quantum Key Distribution (TWQKD) is a relatively new proposal for sharing secret keys that is not fully explored yet. We analyse the security of TWQKD schemes that use qubits prepared in non-orthogonal states to transmit the key. Investigating protocols that employ an arbitrary number of bases for the channel preparation, we show, in particular, that the security of the LM05 protocol can not be improved by the use of more than two preparation bases. We also provide a new proof of unconditional security for a deterministic TWQKD protocol recently proposed [Phys. Rev. A 88, 062302 (2013)]. In addition, we introduce a novel deterministic protocol named TWQKD six-state and compute an analytical lower bound (which can be tightened) for the maximum amount of information that an eavesdropper could extract in this case. An interesting advantage of our approach to the security analysis of TWQKD is the great simplicity and transparency of the derivations.

The simulations allow us to confirm recent predictions for the mean and standard deviation of the Casimir potential, and give us access to its full distribution function in the limit of a dilute distribution of heterogeneities. These predictions are compared with a simple statistical model based on a pairwise summation of the individual contributions of the constituting elements of the medium.

abstract: By using perturbation theory, we show that an hydrogen atom with magnetic moment due to the orbital angular momentum of the electron has hidden momentum in the presence of an external electric field. This means that the atomic electronic cloud has a nonzero linear momentum in its center of mass rest frame due to a relativistic effect. This is completely analogous to the hidden momentum that a classical current loop has in the presence of an external electric field. We discuss that this effect is essential for the validity of the Lorentz force law in quantum systems. We also connect our results to the secular Abraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in material media.

abstract: Optical trapping techniques allow for the formation of bosonic condensates with internal degrees of freedom, so-called spinor condensates. Mean-field models of spinor condensates highlight the sensitivity of the quantum phases of the system to the relative strength of the two-body interaction in the different spin-channels. Such a description captures the regime where these interactions are weak. In the opposite and largely unexplored regime of strongly correlated spinor condensates, three-body interactions can play an important role through the Efimov effect, producing possible novel phases. Here, we study the three-body spinor problem using the hyperspherical adiabatic representation for spin-1, -2 and -3 condensates in the strongly-correlated regime. We characterize the Efimov physics for such systems and the relevant three-body mean-field parameters. We find that the Efimov effect can strongly affect the spin dynamics and three-body mean-field contributions to the possible quantum phases of the condensate through universal contributions to scattering observables.

abstract: Warm atomic vapor quantum memories are simple and robust, yet suffer from a number of parasitic processes which produce excess noise. For operating in a single-photon regime precise filtering of the output light is essential. Here we report a combination of magnetically tuned absorption and Faraday filters, both light-direction-insensitive, which stop the driving lasers and attenuate spurious fluorescence and four-wave mixing while transmitting narrowband Stokes and anti-Stokes photons generated in write-in and readout processes. We characterize both filters with respect to adjustable working parameters. We demonstrate a significant increase in the signal to noise ratio upon applying the filters seen qualitatively in measurements of correlation between the Raman-scattered photons.

abstract: We analyse two possible definitions of the squashed entanglement in an infinite-dimensional bipartite system: direct translation of the finite-dimensional definition and its universal extension. It is shown that the both definitions produce the same lower semicontinuous entanglement measure possessing all basis properties of the squashed entanglement on the set of states having at least one finite marginal entropy. Is also shown that the second definition gives an adequate extension of this measure to the set of all states of infinite-dimensional bipartite system. A general condition relating continuity of the squashed entanglement to continuity of the quantum mutual information is proved and its corollaries are considered. Continuity bound for the squashed entanglement under the energy constraint on one subsystem is obtained by using the tight continuity bound for conditional mutual information (proved in the Appendix by using Winter's technique). It is shown that the same continuity bound is valid for the entanglement of formation. As a result the asymptotic continuity of the both entanglement measures under the energy constraint on one subsystem is proved.

abstract: The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin-orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation.

abstract: We illustrate how non-relativistic quantum mechanics may be recovered from a dynamical Weyl geometry on configuration space and an `ensemble' of trajectories (or `worlds'). The theory, which is free of a physical wavefunction, is presented starting from a classical `many-systems' action to which a curvature term is added. In this manner the equations of equilibrium de~Broglie-Bohm theory are recovered. However, na\"ively the set of solution precludes solutions with non-zero angular momentum (a version of a problem raised by Wallstrom). This is remedied by a slight extension of the action, leaving the equations of motion unchanged.

We consider a case allowing an exact time-optimal realization of environment-mediated non-local system unitaries. For a linear coupling to a harmonic bosonic bath, we derive a speed limit for the implementation time in terms of the fundamental frequency of the bath modes. As a product of two exponentials of the local free wind and the pairwise system-coupling, the Zermelo unitary forms a natural building block for reaching a general unitary by concatenation.

abstract: The phase relation between quantum states represents an essential resource for the storage and processing of quantum information. While quantum phases are commonly controlled dynamically by tuning energetic interactions, utilizing geometric phases that accumulate during cyclic evolution may offer superior robustness to noise. To date, demonstrations of geometric phase control in solid-state systems rely on microwave fields that have limited spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical method based on stimulated Raman adiabatic passage to accumulate a geometric phase, the Berry phase, in an individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using diffraction-limited laser light, we guide the NV center's spin along loops on the Bloch sphere to enclose arbitrary Berry phase and characterize these trajectories through time-resolved state tomography. We investigate the limits of this control due to loss of adiabiaticity and decoherence, as well as its robustness to noise intentionally introduced into the experimental control parameters, finding its resilience to be independent of the amount of Berry phase enclosed. These techniques set the foundation for optical geometric manipulation in future implementations of photonic networks of solid state qubits linked and controlled by light.

abstract: Charge separation in light-harvesting complexes occurs in a pair of tightly coupled chlorophylls at the heart of photosynthetic reaction centers of both plants and bacteria. Recently it has been shown that quantum coherence can, in principle, enhance the efficiency of a solar cell, working like a quantum heat engine (QHE). Here, we propose a biological quantum heat engine (BQHE) motivated by Photosystem {\rm II} reaction center (PS{\rm II} RC) to describe the charge separation. Our model mainly considers two charge-separation pathways more than that in the published literature. The two pathways can interfere via cross-couplings and work together to enhance the charge-separation yields. We explore how these cross-couplings increase the current and voltage of the charge separation and discuss the advantages of multiple pathways in terms of current and power. The robustness of the BQHE against the charge recombination in natural PS{\rm II} RC and dephasing induced by environments is also explored, and extension from two pathways to multiple pathways is made. These results suggest that nature-mimicking architectures with engineered multiple pathways for charge separations might be better for artificial solar energy devices.

abstract: We propose and study various realizations of a Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a cylinder geometry with fermionic cold atoms in optical lattices. The cylindrical optical lattice is created by copropagating Laguerre-Gauss beams, i.e.~light beams carrying orbital angular momentum. By strong focusing of the light beams we create a real space optical lattice in the form of rings, which are offset in energy. A second set of Laguerre-Gauss beams then induces a Raman-hopping between these rings, imprinting phases corresponding to a synthetic magnetic field (artificial gauge field). In addition, by rotating the lattice potential, we achieve a slowly varying flux through the hole of the cylinder, which allows us to probe the Hall response of the system as a realization of Laughlin's thought experiment. We study how in the presence of interactions fractional quantum Hall physics could be observed in this setup.

abstract: We use a simple real-space renormalization group approach to investigate the critical behavior of the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, a one-dimensional quantum spin chain possessing a line of criticality along which critical exponents vary continuously. This approach, which is based on exploiting the on-site symmetry of the model, has been shown to be surprisingly accurate for predicting some aspects of the critical behavior of the Ising model. Our investigation explores this approach in more generality, in a model where the critical behavior has a richer structure but which reduces to the simpler Ising case at a special point. We demonstrate that the correlation length critical exponent as predicted from this real-space renormalization group approach is in broad agreement with the corresponding results from conformal field theory along the line of criticality. Near the Ising special point, the error in the estimated critical exponent from this simple method is comparable to that of numerically-intensive simulations based on much more sophisticated methods, although the accuracy decreases away from the decoupled Ising model point.

abstract: Fundamental to integrated photonic quantum computing is an on-chip method for routing and modulating quantum light emission. We demonstrate a hybrid integration platform consisting of arbitrarily designed waveguide circuits and single photon sources. InAs quantum dots (QD) embedded in GaAs are bonded to an SiON waveguide chip such that the QD emission is coupled to the waveguide mode. The waveguides are SiON core embedded in a SiO2 cladding. A tuneable Mach Zehnder modulates the emission between two output ports and can act as a path-encoded qubit preparation device. The single photon nature of the emission was veri?ed by an on-chip Hanbury Brown and Twiss measurement.

abstract: A medium access control protocol based on quantum entanglement has been introduced by Berces and Imre (2006) and Van Meter (2012). This protocol entirely avoids collisions. It is assumed that the network consists of one access point and two client stations. We extend this scheme to a network with an arbitrary number of client stations. We propose three approaches, namely, the qubit distribution, transmit first election and temporal ordering protocols. The qubit distribution protocol leverages the concepts of Bell-EPR pair or W state triad. It works for networks of up to four CSs. With up to three CSs, there is no probability of collision. In a four-CS network, there is a low probability of collision. The transmit first election protocol and temporal ordering protocols work for a network with any number of CSs. The transmit first election builds upon the concept of W state of size corresponding to the number of client stations. It is fair and collision free. The temporal ordering protocol employs the concepts of Lehmer code and quantum oracle. It is collision free, has a normalized throughput of 100% and achieves quasi-fairness.

abstract: This article introduces a stochastic thermodynamics for driven out-of-equilibrium open quantum systems. A stochastic Schrodinger equation allows to construct quantum trajectories describing the dynamics of the system state vector in presence of an environment. Thermodynamic quantities are then defined at the single quantum trajectory level. We thereby identify coherent contributions, without classical counterparts, leading to quantum fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities. This formalism eventually leads to central fluctuation theorems for entropy, extending in the quantum regime results obtained in classical stochastic thermodynamics. The thermal imprint of coherences on a simple implementation of Jarzynski equality is investigated, opening avenues for a thermodynamic approach to decoherence.

abstract: We consider the electromagnetic field generated by a coherent conductor in which electron transport is described quantum mechanically. We obtain an input-output relation linking the quantum current in the conductor to the measured electromagnetic field. This allows us to compute the outcome of measurements on the field in terms of the statistical properties of the current. We moreover show how under ac-bias the conductor acts as a tunable medium for the field, allowing for the generation of single- and two-mode squeezing through fermionic reservoir engineering. These results explain the recently observed squeezing using normal tunnel junctions [G. Gasse et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111 136601 (2013); J.-C. Forgues et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 130403 (2015)].

abstract: Strongly correlated analogues of topological insulators have been explored in systems with purely on-site symmetries, such as time-reversal or charge conservation. Here, we use recently developed tensor network tools to study a quantum state of interacting bosons which is featureless in the bulk, but distinguished from an atomic insulator in that it exhibits entanglement which is protected by its spatial symmetries. These properties are encoded in a model many-body wavefunction that describes a fully symmetric insulator of bosons on the honeycomb lattice at half filling per site. While the resulting integer unit cell filling allows the state to bypass `no-go' theorems that trigger fractionalization at fractional filling, it nevertheless has nontrivial entanglement, protected by symmetry. We demonstrate this by computing the boundary entanglement spectra, finding a gapless entanglement edge described by a conformal field theory as well as degeneracies protected by the non-trivial action of combined charge-conservation and spatial symmetries on the edge. Here, the tight-binding representation of the space group symmetries plays a particular role in allowing certain entanglement cuts that are not allowed on other lattices of the same symmetry, suggesting that the lattice representation can serve as an additional symmetry ingredient in protecting an interacting topological phase. Our results extend to a related insulating state of electrons, with short-ranged entanglement and no band insulator analogue.

abstract: We compute multi-instanton amplitudes in the sine-Gordon quantum mechanics (periodic cosine potential) by integrating out quasi-moduli parameters corresponding to separations of instantons and anti-instantons. We propose an extension of Bogomolnyi--Zinn-Justin prescription for multi-instanton configurations and an appropriate subtraction scheme. We obtain the multi-instanton contributions to the energy eigenvalue of the lowest band at the zeroth order of the coupling constant. For the configurations with only instantons (anti-instantons), we obtain unambiguous results. For those with both instantons and anti-instantons, we obtain results with imaginary parts, which depend on the path of analytic continuation. We show that the imaginary parts of the multi-instanton amplitudes precisely cancel the imaginary parts of the Borel resummation of the perturbation series, and verify that our results completely agree with those based on the uniform-WKB calculations, thus confirming the resurgence : divergent perturbation series combined with the nonperturbative multi-instanton contributions conspire to give unambiguous results. We also study the neutral bion contributions in the ${\mathbb C}P^{N-1}$ model on ${\mathbb R}^1\times S^{1}$ with a small circumference, taking account of the relative phase moduli between the fractional instanton and anti-instanton. We find that the sign of the interaction potential depends on the relative phase moduli, and that both the real and imaginary parts resulting from quasi-moduli integral of the neutral bion get quantitative corrections compared to the sine-Gordon quantum mechanics.

abstract: We discuss a quantum mechanical indirect measurement method to recover a position dependent Hamilton matrix from time evolution of coherent quantum mechanical states through an object. A mathematical formulation of this inverse problem leads to weighted X-ray transforms where the weight is a matrix. We show that such X-ray transforms are injective with very rough weights. Consequently, we can solve our quantum mechanical inverse problem in several settings, but many physically relevant problems we pose also remain open. We discuss the physical background of the proposed imaging method in detail. We give a rigorous mathematical treatment of a neutrino tomography method that has been previously described in the physical literature.

abstract: We show that in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories, exciting a state with a local operator increases the Renyi entanglement entropies by a constant which is the same for every member of the conformal family. Hence, it is an intrinsic parameter that characterises local operators from the perspective of quantum entanglement. In rational conformal field theories this constant corresponds to the logarithm of the quantum dimension of the primary operator. We provide several detailed examples for the second Renyi entropies and a general derivation.

A particular attention is paid to weak perturbations, both local and periodic; for the latter we prove a version of Saxon-Hutner conjecture.

abstract: We consider two entangled accelerating qubits coupled with real scalar fields, each described by the Unruh-Wald model. It is demonstrated that because of the Unruh effect, the bipartite entanglement of the two qubits suddenly dies when the acceleration of one or more qubits are large enough. We also consider three entangled accelerating qubits in GHZ state and in W state, with equal acceleration-frequency ratio, and found that in either state, the tripartite entanglement suddenly dies at a certain value of acceleration-frequency ratio. The equivalence between the Rindler metric and the Schwarzchild metric in the vicinity of the horizon of a black hole implies that for the two entangled qubits outside a black hole, the entanglement suddenly dies when one or both of the qubits are close enough to the horizon, while for the three entangled qubits in GHZ or W state, the tripartite entanglement suddenly dies when these qubits are close enough to the horizon.

abstract: Quantum mechanics can seem like a departure from everyday experience of the physical world, but constructivist theories assert that learners build new ideas from their existing ones. To explore how students can navigate this tension, we examine video of a focus group completing a tutorial about the "particle in a box." In reasoning about the properties of a quantum particle, the students bring in elements of a classical particle ontology, evidenced by students' language and gestures. This reasoning, however, is modulated by metacognitive moments when the group explicitly considers whether classical intuitions apply to the quantum system. The students find some cases where they can usefully apply classical ideas to quantum physics, and others where they explicitly contrast classical and quantum mechanics. Negotiating this boundary with metacognitive awareness is part of the process of building quantum intuitions. Our data suggest that (some) students bring productive intellectual resources to this negotiation.

url: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1507.00768
abstract: A new class of cost functionals for optimal control of quantum systems which produces controls which are sparse in frequency and smooth in time is proposed. This is achieved by penalizing a suitable time-frequency representation of the control field, rather than the control field itself, and by employing norms which are of $L^1$ or measure form with respect to frequency but smooth with respect to time. A mathematical framework is developed which yields existence of optimal controls and necessary optimality conditions of the resulting nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problem. The framework covers the important systems of physical interest, including (infinite-dimensional) Schr\"odinger dynamics on multiple potential energy surfaces as arising in laser control of chemical reactions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the optimal controls, unlike those obtained with the usual $L^2$ or $H^1$ costs, concentrate on just a few frequencies, even in the infinite-dimensional case of laser-controlled chemical reactions.

abstract: We investigate the stationary states and dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in an Abelian-gauge double-well (DW) potential with pair tunneling by using a full quantum-mechanical treatment. Furthermore, we study the quantum quench dynamics of the Abelian-gauge DW system subjected to a sudden change of the Peierls phase. It is shown that strong pair tunneling evidently influences the energy spectrum structures of the stationary states. For relatively weak repulsive interatomic interactions, the dynamics of the DW system with a maximal initial population difference evolves from Josephson oscillations to quantum self-trapping as we increase the pair tunneling strength, while for large repulsion the strong pair tunneling inhibits the quantum self-trapping. In the case of attractive interatomic interactions, strong pair tunneling tends to destroy the Josephson oscillations and quantum self-trapping, and the system eventually enters a symmetric regime of zero population difference. Finally, the effect of the Peierls phase on the quantum quench dynamics of the system is analyzed and discussed.

abstract: We consider the Casimir interaction, mediated by massless fermions, between a spherical defect and a flat potential barrier, assuming hard (bag-type) boundary conditions at both the barrier and the surface of the sphere. The computation of the quantum interaction energy is carried out using the multiple scattering approach, adapted here to the setup in question. We find an exact integral formula for the energy, from which we extract both the large and short distance asymptotic behaviour. At large distance the fermionic contribution is found to scale as $L^{-3}$, in contrast to that of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations that, assuming perfectly conducting boundaries, scales as $L^{-4}$. At short distance, we compute the leading and sub-leading contribution to the vacuum energy. The leading one coincides with what it is expected from the proximity force approximation, while the sub-leading term gives, contrary to the electromagnetic case, a positive correction to the proximity force result.

abstract: The Majorana code is an example of a stabilizer code where the quantum information is stored in a system supporting well-separated Majorana Bound States (MBSs). We focus on one-dimensional realizations of the Majorana code, as well as networks of such structures, and investigate their lifetime when coupled to a parity-preserving thermal environment. We apply the Davies prescription, a standard method that describes the basic aspects of a thermal environment, and derive a master equation in the Born-Markov limit. We first focus on a single wire with immobile MBSs and perform error correction to annihilate thermal excitations. In the high-temperature limit, we show both analytically and numerically that the lifetime of the Majorana qubit grows logarithmically with the size of the wire. We then study a trijunction with four MBSs when braiding is executed. We study the occurrence of dangerous error processes that prevent the lifetime of the Majorana code from growing with the size of the trijunction. The origin of the dangerous processes is the braiding itself, which separates pairs of excitations and renders the noise nonlocal; these processes arise from the basic constraints of moving MBSs in 1D structures. We confirm our predictions with Monte Carlo simulations in the low-temperature regime, i.e. the regime of practical relevance. Our results put a restriction on the degree of self-correction of this particular 1D topological quantum computing architecture.

abstract: We study the effect of two simultaneous local quenches on the evolution of Loschmidt echo and entanglement entropy of a one dimensional transverse Ising model. In this work, one of the local quenches involves the connection of two spin-1/2 chains at a certain time and the other local quench corresponds to a sudden change in the magnitude of the transverse field at a given site in one of the spin chains. We numerically calculate the dynamics associated with the Loschmidt echo and the entanglement entropy as a result of such double quenches, and discuss various timescales involved in this problem using the picture of quasiparticles generated as a result of such quenches.

abstract: The polarization direction of an electromagnetic field changes and eventually reaches a steady state when propagating through a birefringent material with off axis absorption or gain. The steady state orientation direction depends on the magnitude of the absorption (gain) and the phase retardation rate. The change in the polarization direction is experimentally demonstrated in weakly doped ($0.05\%$) Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals, where the light polarization, if initially aligned along the most strongly absorbing principal axis, gradually switch to a much less absorbing polarization state during the propagation. This means that the absorption coefficient, $\alpha$, in birefringent materials generally varies with length. This is important for, e.g., laser crystal gain media, highly absorbing and narrow band spectral filters and quantum memories.

abstract: Birefringence is one of the fascinating properties of the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in strong electromagnetic fields. The scattering of linearly polarized incident probe photons into a perpendicularly polarized mode provides a distinct signature of the optical activity of the quantum vacuum and thus offers an excellent opportunity for a precision test of non-linear QED. Precision tests require accurate predictions and thus a theoretical framework that is capable of taking the detailed experimental geometry into account. We derive analytical solutions for vacuum birefringence which include the spatio-temporal field structure of a strong optical pump laser field and an x-ray probe. We show that the angular distribution of the scattered photons depends strongly on the interaction geometry and find that scattering of the perpendicularly polarized scattered photons out of the cone of the incident probe x-ray beam is the key to making the phenomenon experimentally accessible with the current generation of FEL/high-field laser facilities.

abstract: Correlated photon pairs are a fundamental building block of quantum photonic systems. While pair sources have previously been integrated on silicon chips built using customized photonics manufacturing processes, these often take advantage of only a small fraction of the established techniques for microelectronics fabrication and have yet to be integrated in a process which also supports electronics. Here we report the first demonstration of quantum-correlated photon pair generation in a device fabricated in an unmodified advanced (sub-100nm) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, alongside millions of working transistors. The microring resonator photon pair source is formed in the transistor layer structure, with the resonator core formed by the silicon layer typically used for the transistor body. With ultra-low continuous-wave on-chip pump powers ranging from 5 $\mu$W to 400 $\mu$W, we demonstrate pair generation rates between 165 Hz and 332 kHz using >80% efficient WSi superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Coincidences-to-accidentals ratios consistently exceeding 40 were measured with a maximum of 55. In the process of characterizing this source we also accurately predict pair generation rates from the results of classical four-wave mixing measurements. This proof-of-principle device demonstrates the potential of commercial CMOS microelectronics as an advanced quantum photonics platform with capability of large volume, pristine process control, and where state-of-the-art high-speed digital circuits could interact with quantum photonic circuits.

One can numerically observe that our proposing quantum walks possess linear spreading and localization as in the case of the Grover walk on lattices. Moreover, our numerical simulation suggests that localization of our quantum walks reflect not only topological but also geometric structures. On the other hand, our proposing quantum walk contains an intrinsic problem concerning exhibition of nontrivial behavior, which is not seen in typical quantum walks such as Grover walks on graphs.

abstract: We compare two calculations of the particle density in the superfluid phase of the classical XY model with a chemical potential $\mu$ in 1+1 dimensions.The first relies on exact blocking formulas from the Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) formulation of the transfer matrix. The second is a worm algorithm. We show that the particle number distributions obtained with the two methods agree well. We use the TRG method to calculate the thermal entropy and the entanglement entropy. We describe the particle density, the two entropies and the topology of the world lines as we increase $\mu$ to go across the superfluid phase between the first two Mott insulating phases. For a sufficiently large temporal size, this process reveals an interesting fine structure: the average particle number and the winding number of most of the world lines in the Euclidean time direction increase by one unit at a time. At each step, the thermal entropy develops a peak and the entanglement entropy increases until we reach half-filling and then decreases in a way that approximately mirror the ascent. This suggests an approximate fermionic picture.

abstract: We derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of squeezed states on a lattice in terms of the complex structure J. The analysis involves the identification of squeezed states with group-theoretical coherent states of the symplectic group and the relation between the coset Sp(2N,R)/Isot(J_0) and the space of complex structures. We present two applications of the new formula: (i) we derive the area law for the ground state of a scalar field on a generic lattice in the limit of small speed of sound, (ii) we compute the rate of growth of the entanglement entropy in the presence of an instability and show that it is bounded from above by the Kolmogorov-Sinai rate.

abstract: We propose a method to study the quantum nonlinearity and observe the multiphoton transitions in a multiatom CQED system. We show that by inducing simultaneously destructive quantum interference for the single-photon and two-photon excitations in the CQED system, it is possible to observe the direct three-photon excitation of the higher-order ladder states of the CQED system. We report an experiment with cold Rb atoms confined in an optical cavity and demonstrate such interference control of the multi-photon excitations of the CQED system. The observed nonlinear excitation of the CQED ladder states agrees with a theoretical analysis based on a fully quantized treatment of the CQED system, but disagrees with the semiclassical analysis of the CQED system. Thus it represents the first direct observation of the quantum nature of the multiatom CQED system and opens new ways to explore quantum nonlinearity and its applications in quantum optical systems in which multiple absorbers/emitters are coupled with photons in confined cavity structures.

abstract: The dark count rate (DCR) is a key parameter of single-photon detectors. By introducing a bulk optical band-pass filter mounted on a fiber-to-fiber optical bench cooled at 3 K and blocking down to 5 micrometer, we suppressed the DCR of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector by more than three orders of magnitude. The DCR is limited by the blackbody radiation through a signal passband of 20 nm bandwidth. The figure of merit, system detection efficiency, and DCR were 2.7 x 10^11, 2.3 %, and 0.001 Hz, respectively. Narrowing the bandwidth to 100 GHz suppresses the DCR to 0.0001 Hz and the figure of merit increases to 1.8 x 10^12.

The propagator for the gauge field is calculated and the interaction between the plate and a point-like electric charge is computed. The boundary condition imposed on the vector field is taken to be the one that vanishes, on the plate, the normal component of the dual field strength to the plate. It is shown that the image method is not valid in Lee-Wick electrodynamics.

The pathological character of the "catastrophe" is demystified by emphasizing the connection between experimental conditions and statistical ensembles, as demonstrated by the recent realization of photon condensation under grand canonical conditions.

abstract: We present reduced-dimensional stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equations describing regimes of confinement and temperature where a 1D or 2D superfluid is immersed in a 3D thermal cloud. The projection formalism provides both a formally rigorous and physically natural way to effect the dimensional reduction. The 3D form of the number-damping (growth) terms is unchanged by the dimensional reduction. Projection of the energy-damping (scattering) terms leads to modified stochastic equations of motion describing energy exchange with the thermal reservoir. The regime of validity of the dimensional reduction is investigated via variational analysis. Paying particular attention to 1D, we validate our variational treatment by comparing numerical simulations of a trapped oblate system in 3D with the 1D theory, and establish a consistent choice of cutoff for the 1D theory. We briefly discuss the scenario involving two-components with different degeneracy, suggesting that a wider regime of validity exists for systems in contact with a buffer-gas reservoir.

abstract: We introduce a variational ansatz for elementary excitations of two-dimensional quantum spin systems, directly in the thermodynamic limit, based on the formalism of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS). Solving the corresponding variational problem requires the evaluation of momentum transformed two-point and three-point correlation functions on a PEPS background, which we can compute efficiently by introducing a variation of the corner transfer matrix. Our approach can be readily extended to topologically non-trivial excitations (anyons) and is illustrated for the elementary excitations in the Affleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki model on the square lattice and a perturbed version of Kitaev's toric code. These developments give direct access to the low-energy sector of strongly correlated two-dimensional quantum systems and allow for the formulation of improved optimization algorithms for determining a variational PEPS ground state approximation.

abstract: Many-body approaches to open quantum systems have recently become powerful tools for investigating the detailed role of dissipative environments in diverse non-equilibrium molecular and condensed matter processes. Here, we report the development of an efficient algorithm that utilises a time-dependent variational principle for matrix product states to evolve large system-environment states. By thus capturing all system-environment correlations, we reproduce the highly non-perturbative, quantum-critical dynamics of the zero temperature spin-boson model, and then exploit the many-body information to output a complete time-frequency spectrum of the environmental excitations. We highlight how theoretical 'environmental spectra' could yield valuable insights into a wide range of complex dissipative processes, by showing that correlated motion of modes entangled with the spin can appear with persistent vibrational coherence, in spite of incoherent spin relaxation.

abstract: More than 30 years ago, Thouless introduced the concept of a topological charge pump that would enable the robust transport of charge through an adiabatic cyclic evolution of the underlying Hamiltonian. In contrast to classical transport, the transported charge was shown to be quantized and purely determined by the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust to perturbations. On a fundamental level, the quantized charge transport can be connected to a topological invariant, the Chern number, first introduced in the context of the integer quantum Hall effect. A Thouless quantum pump may therefore be regarded as a 'dynamical' version of the integer quantum Hall effect. Here, we report on the realization of such a topological charge pump using ultracold bosonic atoms that form a Mott insulator in a dynamically controlled optical superlattice potential. By taking in-situ images of the atom cloud, we observe a quantized deflection per pump cycle. We reveal the genuine quantum nature of the pump by showing that, in contrast to ground state particles, a counterintuitive reversed deflection occurs when particles are prepared in the first excited band. Furthermore, we were able to directly demonstrate that the system undergoes a controlled topological phase transition in higher bands when tuning the superlattice parameters.

abstract: We have been investigating a white-light-cavity signal-recycling (WLC-SR) scheme, incorporating a negative dispersion medium (NDM), to enhance the sensitivity-bandwidth product of a gravitational wave detector. For this system, it is necessary to take into account the quantum noise (QN) due to the NDM. A simple approach for this uses the single channel Caves model (SC-CM) for a phase-insensitive linear amplifier. However, this model may not be valid for complicated systems. Here, we develop a master equation (ME) approach to model the QN, and compare the findings with the SC-CM results. We show that for a two-level system, the SC-CM applies only when pure amplification or attenuation exists. When a four-level system has an absorption dip on top of a broad gain peak, with perfect transparency at the center, yielding the negative dispersion for the WLC-SR scheme, the QN at the center has a large value, in contrast with the SC-CM model, which predicts a null value. We also prove that in a {\Lambda}-type EIT (Electromagnetically Induced Transparency) system, the QN at zero detuning is zero, in agreement with the SC-CM model. We also consider a Gain-EIT (GEIT) system, which has a negative dispersion and very small QN at the bottom of the dip in the gain profile. For some parameters, the ME based QN is very close to that based on the SC-CM, with a difference of <1.75%. The corresponding difference in the enhancement of the sensitivity-bandwidth product is <0.2%. However, for another set of parameters, for which the enhancement factor is even larger (17.66) as predicted by the ME approach, the prediction of these two models differ significantly. Thus, for the GEIT system, one must always use the ME approach for an accurate evaluation of the QN. The technique presented in this paper would enable accurate evaluation of the QN in many systems of interest in precision metrology.

abstract: The concept of transparent and opaque horizons is defined. One example of opaqueness is the presence of a firewall. Two apparently contradictory statements are reconciled: The overwhelming number of black hole states have opaque horizons; and: All black holes formed by natural processes have transparent horizons. A diagnostic is proposed for transparency, namely that the computational complexity of the state be increasing with time. It is shown that opaque horizons are extremely unstable and that the slightest perturbation will make them transparent within a scrambling time.

abstract: The effects of a collection of classical two-level charge fluctuators on the coherence of a dynamically-decoupled qubit are studied. Distinct dynamics are found at different qubit working positions. Exact analytical formulae are derived at pure dephasing and approximate solutions are found at the general working position, for weakly- and strongly-coupled fluctuators. Analysis of these solutions, combined with numerical simulations of the multiple random telegraph processes, reveal the scaling of the noise with the number of fluctuators and the number of control pulses, as well as dependence on other parameters of the qubit-fluctuators system. These results can be used to determine potential microscopic models for the charge environment by performing noise spectroscopy.

abstract: We study a family of weighted random walks on complete graphs. These `democratic walks' turn out to be explicitly solvable, and we find the hierarchy window for which the characteristic time scale saturates the so-called fast scrambling conjecture. We show that these democratic walks describe well the properties of information spreading in systems in which every degree of freedom interacts with every other degree of freedom, such as Matrix or infinite range models. The argument is based on the analysis of suitably defined `Information fields' ($\mathcal{I}$), which are shown to evolve stochastically towards stationarity due to unitarity of the microscopic model. The model implies that in democratic systems, stabilization of one subsystem is equivalent to global scrambling. We use these results to study scrambling of infalling perturbations in black hole backgrounds, and argue that the near horizon running coupling constants are connected to entanglement evolution of single particle perturbations in democratic systems.

abstract: The elementary optical excitations of a two-dimensional electron system strongly coupled to a microcavity are trion-polaritons. Using a variational approach, we demonstrate that the competition between Coulomb interaction and light-matter coupling plays a crucial role in determining the lowest-energy orbital and spin properties of trion-polaritons. When the light-matter interaction exceeds the bare trion binding, singlet and triplet trion states are mixed due to a cavity-mediated spin-orbit effect, which in turn results in a strong increase of the outer electron Bohr radius. In this strong cavity coupling regime, the trion-polariton consists of an exciton-polariton surrounded by a weakly bound electron and is reminiscent of a coherent Rydberg excitation.

abstract: The dynamics of quantum expectation values is considered in a geometric setting. First, expectation values of the canonical operators are shown to be equivariant momentum maps for the action of the Heisenberg group on quantum states. Then, the Hamiltonian structure of Ehrenfest's theorem is shown to be Lie-Poisson for a semidirect-product Lie group, named the `Ehrenfest group'. In addition, quantum dynamics is expressed in the frame of the expectation values, in which the latter undergo canonical Hamiltonian motion. In the case of Gaussian states, expectation values dynamics couples to second-order moments, which also enjoy a momentum map structure. Eventually, Gaussian states are shown to possess a Lie-Poisson structure associated to a semidirect-product subgroup of the Ehrenfest group, which is called the Jacobi group. This structure produces new energy-conserving terms in a class of Gaussian moment models (previously appeared in the chemical physics literature) that suffer from lack of energy conservation in the general case.

abstract: We present an efficient classical algorithm for training deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) that uses rejection sampling in concert with variational approximations to estimate the gradients of the training objective function. Our algorithm is inspired by a recent quantum algorithm for training DBMs. We obtain rigorous bounds on the errors in the approximate gradients; in turn, we find that choosing the instrumental distribution to minimize the alpha=2 divergence with the Gibbs state minimizes the asymptotic algorithmic complexity. Our rejection sampling approach can yield more accurate gradients than low-order contrastive divergence training and the costs incurred in finding increasingly accurate gradients can be easily parallelized. Finally our algorithm can train full Boltzmann machines and scales more favorably with the number of layers in a DBM than greedy contrastive divergence training.

abstract: We consider the quantum XY model and study the effects of interacting perturbations on the time evolution of the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies of spin blocks after global quenches. We show that the entropies are sensitive to perturbations that break hidden symmetries behind the integrability of the model. At times much larger than the characteristic time of the well-known linear increase of the entropies, we identify a time window characterized by a novel linear growth followed by saturation. The typical time of the phenomenon is inversely proportional to the perturbation strength and the behavior is trigger off by the extinction of an infinite number of local conservation laws following a non-abelian algebra. The universality of the crossover is revealed by a semi-classical picture that captures the leading behavior of the entropies. We check our theoretical predictions against iTEBD simulations. The good agreement between theory and numerics substantiates the method developed in [Bertini and Fagotti, J. Stat. Mech. (2015) P07012] for investigating a pre-relaxation limit in weakly interacting models.

abstract: When vortices are displaced in Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), the Magnus force gives the system a momentum transverse in the direction to the displacement. We show that Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in long channels with vortices exhibit a quantization of the current response with respect to the spatial vortex distribution. The quantization originates from the well-known topological property of the phase around a vortex --- it is an integer multiple of $ 2 \pi $. In a similar way to the integer quantum Hall effect, the current along the channel is related to this topological phase, and can be extracted from two experimentally measurable quantities: the total momentum of the BEC and the spatial distribution. The quantization is in units of $ m/2h $, where $ m $ is the mass of the atoms and $ h $ is Planck's constant. We derive an exact vortex momentum-displacement relation for BECs in long channels under general circumstances. Our results presents the possibility that the configuration described here can be used as a novel way of measuring the mass of the atoms in the BEC using a topological invariant of the system. If an accurate determination of the plateaus are experimentally possible, this gives the possibility of a topological quantum mass standard and precise determination of the fine structure constant.

We establish that this symmetry is related to the Cauchy-Riemann equations, in the sense that the associated constraint is a first class constraint only in the case that the potential be holomorphic. As a consequence of this gauge symmetry on the complex space, we can fix the gauge condition in several ways and project from the complex phase-space to real phase space. Different projections are gauge related on the complex phase-space but are not directly related on the real physical phase-space.

abstract: Long-lived population storage in optically pumped levels of rare-earth ions doped into solids, referred to as persistent spectral hole burning, is of significant fundamental and technological interest. Despite numerous observations of deep and persistent holes in various cryogenically cooled rare-earth ion doped crystals, the demonstration of their existence in rare-earth ion doped amorphous hosts, e.g. glasses, has remained an open challenge since many decades. Here we report the first observation and detailed characterization of such holes in an erbium-doped silica glass fiber cooled to below 1 K. We demonstrate population storage in electronic Zeeman-sublevels of the erbium ground state with lifetimes up to 30 seconds and 80\% spin polarization. Our investigation improves the understanding of the fundamental interaction between impurities and vibrational modes in glassy hosts, and reveals a potential technological application of rare-earth ion doped amorphous materials, including at telecommunication wavelength.

abstract: In the $k$-junta testing problem, a tester has to efficiently decide whether a given function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a $k$-junta (i.e., depends on at most $k$ of its input bits) or is $\epsilon$-far from any $k$-junta. Our main result is a quantum algorithm for this problem with query complexity $\tilde O(\sqrt{k/\epsilon})$ and time complexity $\tilde O(n\sqrt{k/\epsilon})$. This quadratically improves over the query complexity of the previous best quantum junta tester, due to At\i c\i\ and Servedio. Our tester is based on a new quantum algorithm for a gapped version of the combinatorial group testing problem, with an up to quartic improvement over the query complexity of the best classical algorithm. For our upper bound on the time complexity we give a near-linear time implementation of a shallow variant of the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group, similar to the Schur-Weyl transform. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega(k^{1/3})$ queries for junta-testing (for constant $\epsilon$).

abstract: We propose a scheme for generating two-dimensional turbulence in harmonically trapped atomic condensates with the novelty of controlling the polarization (net rotation) of the turbulence. Our scheme is based on an initial giant (multicharged) vortex which induces a large-scale circular flow. Two thin obstacles, created by blue-detuned laser beams, speed up the decay of the giant vortex into many singly-quantized vortices of the same circulation; at the same time, vortex-antivortex pairs are created by the decaying circular flow past the obstacles. Rotation of the obstacles against the circular flow controls the relative proportion of positive and negative vortices, from the limit of strongly anisotropic turbulence (almost all vortices having the same sign) to that of isotropic turbulence (equal number of vortices and antivortices). Using the new scheme, we numerically study quantum turbulence and report on its decay as a function of the polarization.

abstract: This work considers reasons for and implications of discarding the assumption of transitivity, which (transitivity) is the fundamental postulate in the utility theory of Von Neumann and Morgenstern, the adiabatic accessibility principle of Caratheodory and most other theories related to preferences or competition. The examples of intransitivity are drawn from different fields, such as law, biology, game theory, economics and competitive evolutionary dynamic. This work is intended as a common platform that allows us to discuss intransitivity in the context of different disciplines. The basic concepts and terms that are needed for consistent treatment of intransitivity in various applications are presented and analysed in a unified manner. The analysis points out conditions that necessitate appearance of intransitivity, such as multiplicity of preference criteria and imperfect (i.e. approximate) discrimination of different cases. The present work observes that with increasing presence and strength of intransitivity, thermodynamics gradually fades away leaving space for more general kinetic considerations. Intransitivity in competitive systems is linked to complex phenomena that would be difficult or impossible to explain on the basis of transitive assumptions. Human preferences that seem irrational from the perspective of the conventional utility theory, become perfectly logical in the intransitive and relativistic framework suggested here. The example of competitive simulations for the risk/benefit dilemma demonstrates the significance of intransitivity in cyclic behaviour and abrupt changes in the system. The evolutionary intransitivity parameter, which is introduced in the Appendix, is a general measure of intransitivity, which is particularly useful in evolving competitive systems. Quantum preferences are also considered in the Appendix.

abstract: The properties of a balanced two-component Fermi gas in a one-dimensional harmonic trap are studied by means of the coupled cluster method. For few fermions this method recovers the results of exact diagonalization, yet it permits studying much larger systems. We compute the energy, the chemical potential, the pairing gap, and the density profile of the trapped clouds, smoothly mapping the crossover between the few-body and many-body limits. The energy is found to converge surprisingly rapidly to the many-body result, while many more particles are needed to give rise to the non-analytic behavior of the pairing gap.

abstract: The method of McCurdy, Baertschy, and Rescigno, J. Phys. B, 37, R137 (2004) is generalized to obtain a straightforward, surprisingly accurate, and scalable numerical representation for calculating the electronic wave functions of molecules. It uses a basis set of product sinc functions arrayed on a Cartesian grid, and yields 1 kcal/mol precision for valence transition energies with a grid resolution of approximately 0.1 bohr. The Coulomb matrix elements are replaced with matrix elements obtained from the kinetic energy operator. A resolution-of-the-identity approximation renders the primitive one- and two-electron matrix elements diagonal; in other words, the Coulomb operator is local with respect to the grid indices. The calculation of contracted two-electron matrix elements among orbitals requires only O(N log(N)) multiplication operations, not O(N^4), where N is the number of basis functions; N = n^3 on cubic grids. The representation not only is numerically expedient, but also produces energies and properties superior to those calculated variationally. Absolute energies, absorption cross sections, transition energies, and ionization potentials are reported for one- (He^+, H_2^+ ), two- (H_2, He), ten- (CH_4) and 56-electron (C_8H_8) systems.

abstract: We present quantum mechanical calculations of the Auger decay rate $\Gamma_A$ of two Rubidium Rydberg atoms with weakly overlapping electron clouds. The two-electron wavefunction is modelled by a single Slater determinant of $nd$ Rydberg orbitals with principal quantum number $n\le35$. The dependence of $\Gamma_A$ on the atom-atom separation $R$ is well described by a power law $\Gamma_A \propto R^{\alpha}$ and we calculate the exponents $\alpha$ for various initial states. For atomic separations equal to the size of the Rydberg electron wave function $R_n$ we find that $\Gamma_A \propto n^{-5}$. We discuss the importance of Auger decay compared to other contributions to the electron dynamics in the two Rydberg atom system.

abstract: Efficient operation sequences to couple and interchange quantum information between quantum dot spin qubits of different kinds are derived using exchange interactions. In the qubit encoding of a single-spin qubit, a singlet-triplet qubit, and an exchange-only (triple-dot) qubit, some of the single-qubit interactions remain on during the entangling operation; this greatly simplifies the operation sequences that construct entangling operations. In the ideal setup, the gate operations use the intra-qubit exchange interactions only once. The limitations of the entangling sequences are discussed, and it is shown how quantum information can be converted between different kinds of quantum dot spin qubits.

abstract: The author analyzes quantum computation with the hybrid qubit (HQ) that is encoded using the three-electron configuration of a double quantum dot. All gate operations are controlled with electric signals, while the qubit remains at an optimal operation point that is insensitive to noise. An effective single-qubit description is derived, and two-qubit interactions are suggested using Coulomb and exchange interactions. Universal quantum control is described and numerically simulated using realistic parameters for HQs in Si and GaAs. High-fidelity quantum computing at the threshold of quantum error correction is possible if the Coulomb interactions between the HQs stay weak.

abstract: We consider an interaction quench in the critical spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXZ chain. We numerically compute the time evolution of the two-point correlation functions of spin operators in the thermodynamic limit and compare the results to predictions obtained in the framework of the Luttinger liquid approximation. We find that the transverse correlation function $\langle S^x_jS^x_{j+\ell}\rangle$ agrees with the Luttinger model prediction to a surprising level of accuracy. The agreement for the longitudinal two-point function $\langle S^z_jS^z_{j+\ell}\rangle$ is found to be much poorer. We speculate that this difference between transverse and longitudinal correlations has its origin in the locality properties of the respective spin operator with respect to the underlying fermionic modes.

abstract: Bilayer graphene is normally a semimetal with parabolic dispersion, but a tunable bandgap up to few hundreds meV can be opened by breaking the symmetry between the layers through an external potential. Ab-initio calculations show that the optical response around the bandgap is strongly dominated by bound excitons, whose characteristics and selection rules differ from the usual excitons found in semiconductor quantum wells. In this work we study the physics of those excitons resonantly coupled to a photonic microcavity, assessing the possibility to reach the strong and the ultrastrong coupling regimes of light-matter interaction. We discover that both regimes are experimentally accessible, thus opening the way for a most promising technological platform, combining mid-infrared quantum polaritonics with the tunability and electronic features of graphene bilayers.

abstract: This thesis explores the coupling of magnetic systems to quantum circuits in the context of quantum computing applications. In particular we study the coupling of superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators to Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs) . The combination of approaches from the fields of Cavity Quantum electrodynamics (QED) and Circuit QED with those from the field of molecular magnetism con provide unique opportunities for quantum computing. We investigate the necessary conditions for coupling single spins and spin ensembles to resonators and what characteristics SMMs should have in order to provide interesting alternatives as quantum bits. We present test measurements of several magnetic samples using both broadband spectroscopy with open waveguides and EPR spectroscopy using coplanar waveguide resonators. We also design, fabricate, and test nanometric constrictions in superconducting resonators with the objective of improving their coupling to single spins. We evaluate the performance of these constricted resonators in comparison to unmodified resonators.

We computed the transmission coefficient and Goos-H\"anchen like shifts for our system and noticed that transmission is not allowed for certain range of energies. In particular, we found that, in contrast to the electrostatic barriers, the magnetic barriers are able to confine Dirac fermions. We also established some correlation between the electronic transmission properties of Dirac fermions with the Goos-H\"anchen like shifts, as reflected in the numerical data.

abstract: A single qubit driven by an appropriate sequence of control pulses can serve as a spectrometer of local noise affecting its energy splitting. We show that by driving and observing two spatially separated qubits, it is possible to reconstruct the spectrum of cross-correlations of noises acting at various locations. When the qubits are driven by the same sequence of pulses, real part of cross-correlation spectrum can be reconstructed, while applying two distinct sequence to the two qubits allows for reconstruction of imaginary part of this spectrum. The latter quantity contains information on either causal correlations between environmental dynamics at distinct locations, or on the occurrence of propagation of noisy signals through the environment. We illustrate the former case by modeling the noise spectroscopy protocol for qubits coupled to correlated two-level systems. While entanglement between the qubits is not necessary, its presence enhances the signal from which the spectroscopic information is reconstructed.

abstract: We investigate the arising of an analogue of the Landau quantization from a background of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry established by a time-like 4-vector and a field configuration of crossed electric and magnetic field. We also analyse the effects on this Landau-type system subject to a hard-wall confining potential by showing a particular case where a discrete spectrum of energy can be obtained. Further, we analyse the effects of a linear confining potential on the Landau-type system. We show that a quantum effect characterized by the dependence of the cyclotron frequency on the quantum numbers of the system can arise in this analogue of the Landau system. As an example, we calculate the cyclotron frequency associated with ground state of the system.

abstract: For a general quantum theory that is describable by a path integral formalism, we construct a mathematical model of an accumulation-to-threshold process whose outcomes give predictions that are nearly identical to the given quantum theory. The model is neither local nor causal in spacetime, but is both local and causal is in a non-observable path space. The probabilistic nature of the squared wavefunction is a natural consequence of the model. We verify the model with simulations, and we discuss possible discrepancies from conventional quantum theory that might be detectable via experiment. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of the model.

abstract: During the last 70 years, the quantum theory of angular momentum has been successfully applied to describing the properties of nuclei, atoms, and molecules, their interactions with each other as well as with external fields. Due to the properties of quantum rotations, the angular momentum algebra can be of tremendous complexity even for a few interacting particles, such as valence electrons of an atom, not to mention larger many-particle systems. In this work, we study an example of the latter: a rotating quantum impurity coupled to a many-body bosonic bath. In the regime of strong impurity-bath couplings the problem involves addition of an infinite number of angular momenta which renders it intractable using currently available techniques. Here, we introduce a novel canonical transformation which allows to eliminate the complex angular momentum algebra from such a class of many-body problems. In addition, the transformation exposes the problem's constants of motion, and renders it solvable exactly in the limit of a slowly-rotating impurity. We exemplify the technique by showing that there exists a critical rotational speed at which the impurity suddenly acquires one quantum of angular momentum from the many-particle bath. Such an instability is accompanied by the deformation of the phonon density in the frame rotating along with the impurity.

abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) attempts to bridge the gap between quantum mechanical and statistical mechanical descriptions of isolated quantum systems. Here, we define unbiased measures for how well the ETH works in various regimes, by mapping general interacting quantum systems on regular lattices onto a single particle living on a high-dimensional graph. By numerically analyzing deviations from ETH behavior in the non-integrable Ising model, we propose a quantity that we call the $n$-$weight$ to democratically characterize the average deviations for all operators residing on a given number of sites, irrespective of their spatial structure. It appears to have a simple scaling form, that we conjecture to hold true for all non-integrable systems. A closely related quantity, that we term the $n$-$distinguishability$, tells us how well two states can be distinguished if only $n$-site operators are measured. Along the way, we discover that complicated operators on average are worse than simple ones at distinguishing between neighboring eigenstates, contrary to the naive intuition created by the usual statements of the ETH that few-body (many-body) operators acquire the same (different) expectation values in nearby eigenstates at finite energy density. Finally, we sketch heuristic arguments that the ETH originates from the limited ability of simple operators to distinguish between quantum states of a system, especially when the states are subject to constraints such as roughly fixed energy with respect to a local Hamiltonian.

abstract: We develop a time-dependent theory to investigate electron dynamics and photoionization processes of diatomic molecules interacting with strong laser fields including electron-electron correlation effects. We combine the recently formulated time-dependent generalized-active-space configuration interaction theory [D. Hochstuhl and M. Bonitz, Phys. Rev. A 86, 053424 (2012); S. Bauch, et al., Phys. Rev. A 90, 062508 (2014)] with a prolate spheroidal basis set including localized orbitals and continuum states to describe the bound electrons and the outgoing photoelectron. As an example, we study the strong-field ionization of the two-center four-electron lithium hydride molecule in different intensity regimes. By using single-cycle pulses, two orientations of the asymmetric heteronuclear molecule are investigated: Li-H, with the electrical field pointing from H to Li, and the opposite case of H-Li. The preferred orientation for ionization is determined and we find a transition from H-Li, for low intensity, to Li-H, for high intensity. The influence of electron correlations is studied at different levels of approximation, and we find a significant change in the preferred orientation. For certain intensity regimes, even an interchange of the preferred configuration is observed, relative to the uncorrelated simulations. Further insight is provided by detailed comparisons of photoelectron angular distributions with and without correlation effects taken into account.

abstract: Technological applications of many-body structures that emerge in gated devices under minimal control are largely unexplored. Here we show how emergent Wigner crystals in a semiconductor quantum wire can facilitate a pivotal requirement for a scalable quantum computer, namely transmitting quantum information encoded in spins faithfully over a distance of micrometers. The fidelity of the transmission is remarkably high, faster than the relevant decohering effects, independent of the details of the spatial charge configuration in the wire, and realizable in dilution refrigerator temperatures. The transfer can evidence near unitary many-body nonequilibrium dynamics hitherto unseen in a solid-state device. It could also be potentially useful in spintronics as a method for pure spin current over a distance without charge movement.

abstract: A pair of conjugate observables, such as the quadrature amplitudes of harmonic motion, have fundamental fluctuations which are bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. However, in a squeezed quantum state, fluctuations of a quantity can be reduced below the standard quantum limit, at the cost of increased fluctuations of the conjugate variable. Here we prepare a nearly macroscopic moving body, realized as a micromechanical resonator, in a squeezed quantum state. We obtain squeezing of one quadrature amplitude $1.1 \pm 0.4$ dB below the standard quantum limit, thus achieving a long-standing goal of obtaining motional squeezing in a macroscopic object.

abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots in silicon are promising qubits because of long spin coherence times and their potential for scalability. However, such qubits with complete electrical control and fidelities above the threshold for quantum error correction have not yet been achieved. We show theoretically that the threshold fidelity can be achieved with ac gate operation of the quantum dot hybrid qubit. Formed by three electrons in a double dot, this qubit is electrically controlled, does not require magnetic fields, and runs at GHz gate speeds. We analyze the decoherence caused by 1/f charge noise in this qubit, find parameters that minimize the charge noise dependence in the qubit frequency, and determine the optimal working points for ac gate operations that drive the detuning and tunnel coupling.

abstract: Conformal field theory has turned out to be a powerful tool to derive two-dimensional lattice models displaying fractional quantum Hall physics. So far most of the work has been for lattices with open boundary conditions in at least one of the two directions, but it is desirable to also be able to handle the case of periodic boundary conditions. Here, we take steps in this direction by deriving analytical expressions for a family of conformal field theory states on the torus that is closely related to the family of bosonic and fermionic Laughlin states. We compute how the states transform when a particle is moved around the torus and when the states are translated or rotated, and we provide numerical evidence in particular cases that the states become orthonormal up to a common factor for large lattices. We use these results to find the S-matrix of the states, which turns out to be the same as for the continuum Laughlin states. Finally, we show that when the states are defined on a square lattice with suitable lattice spacing they practically coincide with the Laughlin states restricted to a lattice.

These techniques add to the general toolbox for integration and integral transforms such as the Fourier and Laplace transforms. The new methods also yield new perturbative expansions when the integrals cannot be solved analytically. Here, we add new results, for example, on expressing the Laplace transform and its inverse in terms of derivatives. The new methods can be used to express path integrals in terms of functional differentiation, and they also suggest new perturbative expansions in quantum field theory.

abstract: In this paper we study the time evolution of (Renyi) entanglement entropies for locally excited states in four dimensional free massless fermionic field theory. Locally excited states are defined by being acted by various local operators on the ground state. Their excesses are defined by subtracting (Renyi) entanglement entropy for the ground state from those for locally excited states. They finally approach some constant if the subsystem is given by half of the total space. They have spin dependence. They can be interpreted in terms of quasi-particles.

abstract: Decoherence of a central spin coupled to an interacting spin bath via inhomogeneous Heisenberg coupling is studied by two different approaches, namely an exact equations of motion (EOMs) method and a Chebyshev expansion technique (CET). By assuming a wheel topology of the bath spins with uniform nearest-neighbor $XX$-type intrabath coupling, we examine the central spin dynamics with the bath prepared in two different types of bath initial conditions. For fully polarized baths in strong magnetic fields, the polarization dynamics of the central spin exhibits a collapse-revival behavior in the intermediate-time regime. Under an antiferromagnetic bath initial condition, the two methods give excellently consistent central spin decoherence dynamics for finite-size baths of $N\leq14$ bath spins. The decoherence factor is found to drop off abruptly on a short time scale and approach a finite plateau value which depends on the intrabath coupling strength non-monotonically. In the ultrastrong intrabath coupling regime, the plateau values show an oscillatory behavior depending on whether $N/2$ is even or odd. The observed results are interpreted qualitatively within the framework of the EOM and perturbation analysis. Possible experimental realization of the model in a modified quantum corral setup is discussed. Our results may provide new insight into the control of single-spin decoherence by engineering the internal structures of its spin environment in more realistic solid-state systems.

abstract: Topological insulators have attracted abundant attention for a variety of reasons -- notably, the possibility for lossless energy transport through edge states `protected' against disorder. Topological effects like the Quantum Hall state can be induced through a gauge field, which is however hard to create in practice, especially for charge-neutral particles. One way to induce an effective gauge potential is through a dynamic, time-periodic modulation of the lattice confining such particles. In this way, the Haldane Quantum Hall effect was recently observed in a cold atom system. Here, we show how this same effect can be induced for light confined to a lattice of identical optical resonators, using an on-site modulation of the resonant frequencies. We further demonstrate the existence of one-directional edge states immune to back-scattering losses, and discuss the possibilities for a practical implementation, which would enable slow-light devices of unprecedented quality.

abstract: We revisit the applications of integral geometry in AdS$_3$ and argue that the volume form of the kinematic space can be understood as a measure of entanglement between the end points of a geodesic. We explain how this idea naturally fits into the picture of entanglement renormalization of an entangled pair, from which we can holographically understand the operations of disentangler and isometry in multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). A renormalization group (RG) equation of the long-distance entanglement is then derived, which indicates how the entanglement is reshuffled by holographic isometry operation. We then generalize this integral geometric construction to higher dimensions and in particular demonstrate how it works in bulk space of homogeneity and isotropy.

abstract: We report the observation of quantum reflection from a narrow, attractive, potential using bright solitary matter-waves formed from a 85Rb Bose-Einstein condensate. We create narrow potentials using a tightly focused, red-detuned laser beam, and observe reflection of up to 25% of the atoms, along with the trapping of atoms at the position of the beam. We show that the observed reflected fraction is much larger than theoretical predictions for a narrow Gaussian potential well; a more detailed model of bright soliton propagation, accounting for the generic presence of small subsidiary intensity maxima in the red-detuned beam, suggests that these small intensity maxima are the cause of this enhanced reflection.

abstract: The current generation of D-Wave quantum annealing processor is designed to minimize the energy of an Ising spin configuration whose pairwise interactions lie on the edges of a {\em Chimera} graph $\mathcal C_{M,N,L}$. In order to solve an Ising spin problem with arbitrary pairwise interaction structure, the corresponding graph must be minor-embedded into a Chimera graph. We define a combinatorial class of {\em native clique minors} in Chimera graphs with vertex images of uniform, near minimal size, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a maximum native clique minor in a given induced subgraph of a Chimera graph. These minors allow improvement over recent work and have immediate practical applications in the field of quantum annealing.

abstract: We study the time evolution of two coupled many-body quantum systems one of which is assumed to be Bose condensed. Specifically, we consider two ultracold atomic clouds populating each two localized single-particle states, i.e. a two-component Bosonic Josephson junction. The cold atoms cloud can retain its coherence when coupled to the condensate and displays synchronization with the latter, differing from usual entrainment. We term this effect among the ultracold and the condensed clouds as {\it hybrid synchronization}. The onset of synchronization, which we observe in the evolution of average properties of both gases when increasing their coupling, is found to be related to the many-body properties of the quantum gas, e.g. condensed fraction, quantum fluctuations of the particle number differences. We discuss the effects of different initial preparations, the influence of unequal particle numbers for the two clouds, and explore the dependence on the initial quantum state, e.g. coherent state, squeezed state and Fock state, finding essentially the same phenomenology in all cases.

abstract: The processes of generation of phonons and electron excitations with quantum oriented particle in crystal are considered. Expressions are obtained for the probability of emission of phonons and plasmons with channeled particle. The theory of the processes of the crystal excitation with the channeled particle, accompanied by the simultaneous emission of a photon is developed. It is proved that all the specific features of the electron and phonon crystal excitation structure appear as components of radiation of the oriented fast charged particle. The photon emission of a quantum channeled particle, accompanied by a plasmon excitation in a crystal target is considered. It is taken into account that the plasmon energy in the crystal is of the same order with the depth of the potential well in which the channeled particle moves. A weak dispersion of the plasmons in the crystal is taken into account, which leads to the selection of the fixed plasmon energy. It is shown that fast charged particle in the rest frame emits photons with an energy equal to the energy difference between two quantized levels of transverse motion with the deduction of the net plasmon energy. The characteristics of photon-plasmon radiation are investigated.

abstract: Several quantum process algebras have been proposed and successfully applied in verification of quantum cryptographic protocols. All of the bisimulations proposed so far for quantum processes in these process algebras are state-based, implying that they only compare individual quantum states, but not a combination of them. This paper remedies this problem by introducing a novel notion of distribution-based bisimulation for quantum processes. We further propose an approximate version of this bisimulation that enables us to prove more sophisticated security properties of quantum protocols which cannot be verified using the previous bisimulations. In particular, we prove that the quantum key distribution protocol BB84 is sound and (asymptotically) secure against the intercept-resend attacks by showing that the BB84 protocol, when executed with such an attacker concurrently, is approximately bisimilar to an ideal protocol, whose soundness and security are obviously guaranteed, with at most an exponentially decreasing gap.

abstract: Quantum transport is the study of the motion of electrons through nano-scale structures small enough that quantum effects are important. In this contribution I review recent theoretical proposals to use the techniques of quantum feedback control to manipulate the properties of electron flows and states in quantum-transport devices. Quantum control strategies can be grouped into two broad classes: measurement-based control and coherent control, and both are covered here. I discuss how measurement-based techniques are capable of producing a range of effects, such as noise suppression, stabilisation of nonequillibrium quantum states and the realisation of a nano-electronic Maxwell's demon. I also describe recent results on coherent transport control and its relation to quantum networks.

abstract: We study a system of few fermions in a one-dimensional harmonic trap, and focus on the case of dipolar majority particles in contact with a single impurity. The impurity is used both for quenching the system, and for tracking the system evolution after the quench. Employing exact diagonalization, we investigate relaxation and thermalization properties. In the absence of dipolar interactions, the system is near integrability, and the dynamics remains oscillatory even on long time scales. On the other hand, repulsive as well as attractive dipolar interactions lead to quick relaxation to the diagonal ensemble average which is significantly different from corresponding thermal averages. A Wigner-shaped level spacing distribution indicates level repulsion and thus chaotic dynamical behavior due to the presence of dipolar interactions.

abstract: We consider the density matrices derived from combinatorial laplacian matrix of graphs. Specifically, the star-relevant graph, which means adding certain edges on peripheral vertices of star graph, is the focus of this paper. Initially, we provide the spectrum of the density matrices corresponding to star-like graph(i.e., adding an edge on star graph) and present that the Von Neumann entropy will increase under the graph operation(adding an edge on star graph) and the graph operation cannot simulated by local operation and classical communication (LOCC). Subsequently, we illustrate the spectrum of density matrices corresponding to star-alike graph(i.e, adding one edge on star-like graph) and exhibit that the Von Neumann entropy will increase under the graph operation(adding an edge on star-like graph)and the graph operation cannot simulated by LOCC. Finally, the spectrum of density matrices corresponding to star-mlike graph(i.e.,adding $m$ nonadjacent edges on the peripheral vertices of star graph) is demonstrated and the relation between the graph operation and Von Neumann entropy, LOCC is revealed in this paper.

abstract: A line of work initiated by Terhal and DiVincenzo and Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd, shows that quantum computers can efficiently sample from probability distributions that cannot be exactly sampled efficiently on a classical computer, unless the PH collapses. Aaronson and Arkhipov take this further by considering a distribution that can be sampled efficiently by linear optical quantum computation, that under two feasible conjectures, cannot even be approximately sampled classically within bounded total variation distance, unless the PH collapses. In this work we use Quantum Fourier Sampling to construct a class of distributions that can be sampled by a quantum computer. We then argue that these distributions cannot be approximately sampled classically, unless the PH collapses, under variants of the Aaronson and Arkhipov conjectures. In particular, we show a general class of quantumly sampleable distributions each of which is based on an "Efficiently Specifiable" polynomial, for which a classical approximate sampler implies an average-case approximation. This class of polynomials contains the Permanent but also includes, for example, the Hamiltonian Cycle polynomial, and many other familiar #P-hard polynomials. Although our construction, unlike that proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov, likely requires a universal quantum computer, we are able to use this additional power to weaken the conjectures needed to prove approximate sampling hardness results.

abstract: We extend our studies of holographic entropy inequalities to gapped phases of matter. For any number of regions, we determine the linear entropy inequalities satisfied by systems in which the entanglement entropy satisfies an exact area law. In particular, we find that all holographic entropy inequalities are valid in such systems. In gapped systems with topological order, the "cyclic inequalities" derived recently for the holographic entanglement entropy generalize the Kitaev-Preskill formula for the topological entanglement entropy. Finally, we propose a candidate linear inequality for general 4-party quantum states.

abstract: For closed quantum systems driven away from equilibrium, work is often defined in terms of projective measurements of initial and final energies. This definition leads to statistical distributions of work that satisfy nonequilibrium work and fluctuation relations. While this two-point measurement definition of quantum work can be justified heuristically by appeal to the first law of thermodynamics, its relationship to the classical definition of work has not been carefully examined. In this paper we employ semiclassical methods, combined with numerical simulations of a driven quartic oscillator, to study the correspondence between classical and quantal definitions of work in systems with one degree of freedom. We find that a semiclassical work distribution, built from classical trajectories that connect the initial and final energies, provides an excellent approximation to the quantum work distribution when the trajectories are assigned suitable phases and are allowed to interfere. Neglecting the interferences between trajectories reduces the distribution to that of the corresponding classical process. Hence, in the semiclassical limit, the quantum work distribution converges to the classical distribution, decorated by a quantum interference pattern. We also derive the form of the quantum work distribution at the boundary between classically allowed and forbidden regions, where this distribution tunnels into the forbidden region. Our results clarify how the correspondence principle applies in the context of quantum and classical work distributions, and contribute to the understanding of work and nonequilibrium work relations in the quantum regime.

abstract: A systematic study of fractional revival at two sites in $XX$ quantum spin chains is presented and analytic models with this phenomenon are exhibited. The generic models have two essential parameters and a revival time that does not depend on the length of the chain. They are obtained by combining two basic ways of realizing fractional revival in a spin chain each bringing one parameter. The first proceeds through isospectral deformations of spin chains with perfect state transfer. The second arises from the recurrence coefficients of the para-Krawtchouk polynomials with a bi-lattice orthogonality grid. It corresponds to an analytic model previously identified that can possess perfect state transfer in addition to fractional revival.

abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices offer a great promise to generate entangled states for scalable quantum information processing owing to the inherited long coherence time and controllability over a large number of particles. We report on the generation, manipulation and detection of atomic spin entanglement in an optical superlattice. Employing a spin-dependent superlattice, atomic spins in the left or right sites can be individually addressed and coherently manipulated by microwave pulses with near unitary fidelities. Spin entanglement of the two atoms in the double wells of the superlattice is generated via dynamical evolution governed by spin superexchange. By observing collisional atom loss with in-situ absorption imaging we measure spin correlations of atoms inside the double wells and obtain the lower boundary of entanglement fidelity as $0.79\pm0.06$, and the violation of a Bell's inequality with $S=2.21\pm 0.08$. The above results represent an essential step towards scalable quantum computation with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

abstract: With recent developments in simulating nonadiabatic systems to high accuracy, it has become possible to determine how much energy is attributed to nuclear quantum effects beyond zero-point energy. In this work we calculate the non-relativistic ground-state energies of atomic and molecular systems without the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For this purpose we utilize the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, in which the nodes depend on both the electronic and ionic positions. We report ground-state energies for all systems studied, ionization energies for the first-row atoms and atomization energies for the first-row hydrides. We find the ionization energies of the atoms to be nearly independent of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, within the accuracy of our results. The atomization energies of molecular systems, however, show small effects of the nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and nuclei.

abstract: Lorentz symmetry is one of the cornerstones of modern physics. However, a number of theories aiming at unifying gravity with the other fundamental interactions including string field theory suggest violation of Lorentz symmetry [1-4]. While the energy scale of such strongly Lorentz symmetry-violating physics is much higher than that currently attainable by particle accelerators, Lorentz violation may nevertheless be detectable via precision measurements at low energies [2]. Here, we carry out a systematic theoretical investigation of the sensitivity of a wide range of atomic systems to violation of local Lorentz invariance (LLI). Aim of these studies is to identify which atom shows the biggest promise to detect violation of Lorentz symmetry. We identify the Yb+ ion as an ideal system with high sensitivity as well as excellent experimental controllability. By applying quantum information inspired technology to Yb+, we expect tests of LLI violating physics in the electron-photon sector to reach levels of $10^{-23}$, five orders of magnitude more sensitive than the current best bounds [5-7]. Most importantly, the projected sensitivity of $10^{-23}$ for the Yb+ ion tests will allow for the first time to probe whether Lorentz violation is minimally suppressed at low energies for photons and electrons.

abstract: We investigate the resilience of symmetry-protected topological edge states at the boundaries of Kitaev chains in the presence of a bath which explicitly introduces symmetry-breaking terms. Specifically, we focus on single-particle losses and gains, violating the protecting parity symmetry, which could generically occur in realistic scenarios. For homogeneous systems, we show that the Majorana mode decays exponentially fast. By the inclusion of strong disorder, where the closed system enters a many-body localized phase, we find that the Majorana mode can be stabilized substantially. The decay of the Majorana converts into a stretched exponential form for particle losses or gains occuring in the bulk. In particular, for pure loss dynamics we find a universal exponent $\alpha \simeq 2/3$. We show that this holds both in the Anderson and many-body localized regimes. Our results thus provide a first step to stabilize edge states even in the presence of symmetry-breaking environments.

We show that despite the presence of charge noise in the emission spectrum of the dot, resonant excitation acts as a filter to generate narrow bandwidth photons.

abstract: We have studied the variation in fine-structure splitting (FSS) under application of vertical electric field in a range of quantum dots grown by different methods. In each sample we confirm that this energy splitting changes linearly over the field range we can access. We conclude that this linear tuning is a general feature of self-assembled quantum dots, observed under different growth conditions, emission wavelengths and in different material systems. Statistical measurements of characteristic parameters such as emission energy, Stark shift and FSS tuning are presented which may provide a guide for future attempts to increase the yield of quantum dots that can be tuned to a minimal value of FSS with vertical electric field.

abstract: Efimov physics is a leading research theme in recent few-body quantum physics. It also provides a very stimulating playground to explore novel forms of quantum matter. However, not much is known about its relevance in a many-body context. Here, we address this question in a mass-and-density imbalanced two-species fermionic mixture with a positive scattering length. We identify a range of mass ratios and densities for which the system undergoes a phase transition to a gas of universal trimers closely related to Efimov physics. We study the trimer-trimer interaction and find it to be repulsive at low energy. This suggests that the trimer phase is a stable SU$(3)$ Fermi liquid. The stability against recombination losses makes it specially appealing for cold-atom experiments. A fermionic $^6$Li-$^{53}$Cr mixture is a leading candidate to observe experimentally this trimer phase. These results are a first step towards the exploration of novel many-body ground states whose building blocks are universal clusters connected to Efimov physics.

abstract: We evaluate the microwave admittance of a one-dimensional chain of fluxonium qubits coupled by shared inductors. Despite its simplicity, this system exhibits a rich phase diagram. A critical applied magnetic flux separates a homogeneous ground state from a phase with a ground state exhibiting inhomogeneous persistent currents. Depending on the parameters of the array, the phase transition may be a conventional continuous one, or of a commensurate-incommensurate nature. Furthermore, quantum fluctuations affect the transition and possibly lead to the presence of gapless "floating phases". The signatures of the soft modes accompanying the transitions appear as a characteristic frequency dependence of the dissipative part of admittance.

We compare these expansions to numerical simulations of the infinite-size system to determine their range of applicability. We also discuss a sum rule for the density-density correlations that can be used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems.

abstract: Beam alignment is an important practical aspect of the application of squeezed states of light. Misalignments in the detection of squeezed light result in a reduction of the observable squeezing level. In the case of squeezed vacuum fields that contain only very few photons, special measures must be taken in order to sense and control the alignment of the essentially dark beam. The GEO600 gravitational wave detector employs a squeezed vacuum source to improve its detection sensitivity beyond the limits set by classical quantum shot noise. Here, we present our design and implementation of an alignment sensing and control scheme that ensures continuous optimal alignment of the squeezed vacuum field at GEO 600 on long time scales in the presence of free-swinging optics. This first demonstration of a squeezed light automatic alignment system will be of particular interest for future long-term applications of squeezed vacuum states of light.

abstract: Based on the view that thermal equilibrium should be characterized through macroscopic observations, we develop a general theory about typicality of thermal equilibrium and the approach to thermal equilibrium in macroscopic quantum systems. We first formulate the notion that a pure state in an isolated quantum system represents thermal equilibrium. Then by assuming, or proving in certain classes of nontrivial models (including that of two bodies in thermal contact), large-deviation type bounds (which we call thermodynamic bounds) for the microcanonical ensemble, we prove that to represent thermal equilibrium is a typical property for pure states in the microcanonical energy shell. We also establish the approach to thermal equilibrium under two different assumptions; one is that the initial state has a moderate energy distribution, and the other is the energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We also discuss three easily solvable models in which these assumptions can be verified.

The hyperfine structure of the potential energy curves of the states correlated to the K($4s\,^2S_{1/2}$)+Cs($6p\,^2P_{1/2,3/2}$) dissociation limits is described in terms of different coupling schemes depending on the internuclear distance $R$. These results provide the first step in the calculation of the hyperfine structure of rovibrational levels of these excited molecular states in the perspective of the identification of efficient paths for creating ultracold ground-state KCs molecules.

abstract: We obtain exact solutions of the (2+1) dimensional Dirac oscillator in a homogeneous magnetic field within the Anti-Snyder modified uncertainty relation characterized by a momentum cut-off ($p\leq p_{\text{max}}=1/ \sqrt{\beta}$). In ordinary quantum mechanics ($\beta\to 0$) this system is known to have a single left-right chiral quantum phase transition (QPT). We show that a finite momentum cut-off modifies the spectrum introducing additional quantum phase transitions. It is also shown that the presence of momentum cut-off modifies the degeneracy of the states.

abstract: Part I: The geometric algebra of space is derived by extending the real number system to include three mutually anticommuting square roots of plus one. The resulting geometric algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of complex 2x2 matrices, also known as the Pauli algebra. The so-called spinor algebra of C(2), the language of the quantum mechanics, is formulated in terms of the idempotents and nilpotents of the geometric algebra of space, including its beautiful representation on the Riemann sphere, and a new proof of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In "Part II: Spacetime Algebra of Dirac Spinors", the ideas are generalized to apply to 4-component Dirac spinors, and their geometric interpretation in spacetime.

abstract: In "Part I: Vector Analysis of Spinors", the author studied the geometry of two component spinors as points on the Riemann sphere in the geometric algebra of three dimensional Euclidean space. Here, these ideas are generalized to apply to four component Dirac spinors on the complex Riemann sphere in the complexified geometric algebra of spacetime, which includes Lorentz transformations. The development of generalized Pauli matrices eliminate the need for the traditional Dirac gamma matrices. We give the discrete probability distribution of measuring a spin 1/2 particle in an arbitrary spin state, assuming that it was prepared in a given state immediately prior to the measurement, independent of the inertial system in which measurements are made. The Fierz identities between the physical observables of a Dirac spinor are discussed.

abstract: We use uniform matrix product states (MPS) to study the (1+1)D $O(2)$ and $O(4)$ rotor models, which are equivalent to the Kogut-Susskind formulation of matter-free nonabelian lattice gauge theory on a "hawaiian earring" graph for $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$, respectively. Applying tangent space methods to obtain ground states and determine the mass gap and the $\beta$-function, we find excellent agreement with known strong results, locating the BKT transition for $O(2)$ and successfully entering the asymptotic weak-coupling regime for $O(4)$. To obtain a finite local Hilbert space, we truncate in the space of irreducible representations (irreps) of the gauge group, comparing the effects of different cutoff values. We find that higher irreps become important in the crossover and weak-coupling regimes of the nonabelian theory, where entanglement also suddenly increases. This could have important consequences for TNS studies of Yang-Mills on higher dimensional graphs.

abstract: Although quantum logic by using exogenous approach has been proposed for reasoning about closed quantum systems, an improvement would be worth to study quantum logic based on density operators instead of unit vectors in the state logic point of view. In order to achieve this, we build an exogenous quantum operator logic(EQOL) based on density operators for reasoning about open quantum systems. We show that this logic is sound and complete. Just as the exogenous quantum propositional logic(EQPL), by applying exogenous approach, EQOL is extended from the classical propositional logic, and is used to describe the state logic based on density operators. As its applications, we confirm the entanglement property about Bell states by reasoning and logical argument, also verify the existence of eavesdropping about the basic BB84 protocol. As a novel type of mathematical formalism for open quantum systems, we introduce an exogenous quantum Markov chain(EQMC) where its quantum states are labelled using EQOL formulae. Then, an example is given to illustrate the termination verification problem of a generalized quantum loop program described using EQMC.

abstract: In this paper, we study the physical meaning of the wavefunction of the universe. With the continuity equation derived from the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation in the minisuperspace model, we show that the quantity $\rho(a)=|\psi(a)|^2$ for the universe is inversely proportional to the Hubble parameter of the universe. Thus, $\rho(a)$ represents the probability density of the universe staying in the state $a$ during its evolution, which we call the dynamical interpretation of the wavefunction of the universe. We demonstrate that the dynamical interpretation can predict the evolution laws of the universe in the classical limit as those given by the Friedmann equation. Furthermore, we show that the value of the operator ordering factor $p$ in the WDW equation can be determined to be $p=-2$.

abstract: We investigate theoretically in detail the non-linear effects in the response of an optical/microwave cavity coupled to a Duffing mechanical resonator. The cavity is driven by a laser at a red or blue mechanical subband, and a probe laser measures the reflection close to the cavity resonance. Under these conditions, we find that the cavity exhibits optomechanically induced reflection (OMIR) or absorption (OMIA) and investigate the optomechanical response in the limit of non-linear driving of the mechanics. Similar to linear mechanical drive, an overcoupled cavity the red-sideband drive may lead to both OMIA and OMIR depending on the strength of the drive, whereas the blue-sideband drive only leads to OMIR. The dynamics of the phase of the mechanical resonator leads to the difference between the shapes of the response of the cavity and the amplitude response of the driven Duffing oscillator, for example, at weak red-sideband drive the OMIA dip has no inflection point. We also verify that mechanical non-linearities beyond Duffing model have little effect on the size of the OMIA dip though they affect the width of the dip.

abstract: We introduce a binary relation on the finite discrete probability distributions which generalizes notions of majorization that have been studied in quantum information theory. Motivated by questions in thermodynamics, our relation describes the transitions induced by bistochastic maps in the presence of additional auxiliary systems which may become correlated in the process. We show that this relation is completely characterized by Shannon entropy, which yields the following result as a simple corollary: Shannon entropy is (up to some constants) the unique real function on the probability distributions without zeros which is Schur-concave, additive, and subadditive.

We consider the generator of rotations on the noncommutative plane and the Lie algebra generated by Hermitian rotationally invariant quadratic forms of noncommutative dynamical variables. We show that two quantum phases are possible, characterized by the Lie algebras $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ or $su(2)$ according to the relation between the noncommutativity parameters, with the rotation generator related with the Casimir operator. From this algebraic perspective, we analyze the spectrum of some simple models with nonrelativistic rotationally invariant Hamiltonians in this noncommutative phase space, as the isotropic harmonic oscillator, the Landau problem and the cylindrical well potential.

abstract: The entanglement entropy in three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) receives a logarithmic contribution characterized by a regulator-independent function $a(\theta)$ when the entangling surface contains a sharp corner with opening angle $\theta$. In the limit of a smooth surface ($\theta\rightarrow\pi$), this corner contribution vanishes as $a(\theta)=\sigma\,(\theta-\pi)^2$. In arXiv:1505.04804, we provided evidence for the conjecture that for any $d=3$ CFT, this corner coefficient $\sigma$ is determined by $C_T$, the coefficient appearing in the two-point function of the stress tensor. Here, we argue that this is a particular instance of a much more general relation connecting the analogous corner coefficient $\sigma_n$ appearing in the $n$th R\'enyi entropy and the scaling dimension $h_n$ of the corresponding twist operator. In particular, we find the simple relation $h_n/\sigma_n=(n-1)\pi$. We show how it reduces to our previous result as $n\rightarrow 1$, and explicitly check its validity for free scalars and fermions. With this new relation, we show that as $n\rightarrow 0$, $\sigma_n$ yields the coefficient of the thermal entropy, $c_S$. We also reveal a surprising duality relating the corner coefficients of the scalar and the fermion. Further, we use our result to predict $\sigma_n$ for holographic CFTs dual to four-dimensional Einstein gravity. Our findings generalize to other dimensions, and we emphasize the connection to the interval R\'enyi entropies of $d=2$ CFTs.

abstract: We show that Zeeman excitations in an ensemble of highly magnetic atoms trapped in an optical lattice lead to interacting Frenkel excitons described by a tunable $t$-$V$ model. The dispersion of the excitons and the interactions between excitons can be tuned in a wide range by transferring atoms to different Zeeman states. We show that these parameters are insensitive to an external magnetic field, which leads to an interesting possibility of engineering lattice models with significant particle-non-conserving terms. We consider the coupling of the Zeeman excitations to the translational motion of atoms in the lattice and show that the resulting Hamiltonian is equivalent to a polaron Hamiltonian, where the mathematical form of the particle - phonon interaction can be tuned by transferring atoms to different Zeeman states. We calculate the model parameters for the specific system of Dy atoms on an optical lattice with the lattice site separation 266 nm and show that the exciton interaction parameters can be tuned to significant magnitudes reaching tens of Hz. The ability to tune the exciton model parameters can be used to study the pairing of Frenkel excitons or Anderson localization of Zeeman excitations. We show that a Zeeman excitation placed on a single atom in a one-dimensional optical lattice partially populated with Dy atoms forms an exponentially localized distribution characteristic of Anderson localization within 1.5 seconds.

abstract: By applying Darboux-Crum transformations to the Lax pair formulation of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, we construct new sets of multi-soliton solutions to it as well as to the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. The obtained solutions exhibit a chiral asymmetry in propagation of different types defects in crystalline backgrounds. We show that the KdV solitons of pulse and compression modulation types, which support bound states in semi-infinite and finite forbidden bands in the spectrum of the perturbed quantum one-gap Lame system, propagate in opposite directions with respect to the asymptotically periodic background. A similar but more complicated picture also appears for the multi-kink-antikink mKdV solitons that propagate with a privileged direction over topologically trivial or topologically nontrivial crystalline background in dependence on position of energy levels of the trapped bound states in spectral gaps of the associated Dirac system. Exotic N=4 nonlinear supersymmetric structure incorporating Lax-Novikov integrals of a pair of perturbed Lame systems is shown to underlie the Miura-Darboux-Crum construction. It unifies the KdV and mKdV solutions, detects the defects and distinguishes their types, and identifies the types of crystalline backgrounds.

abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and the spin-orbital entanglement of a one-dimensional SU(2)$\otimes XXZ$ model with SU(2) spin exchange and anisotropic $XXZ$ orbital exchange interactions and negative exchange coupling. As a unique feature, the spin-orbital entanglement entropy in the entangled ground states increases here linearly with system size. In the case of Ising orbital interactions we identify an emergent phase with long-range spin-singlet dimer correlations triggered by a quadrupling of correlations in the orbital sector. The peculiar translational invariant spin-singlet dimer phase has finite von Neumann entanglement entropy and survives when orbital quantum fluctuations are included. It even persists in the isotropic SU(2)$\otimes$SU(2) limit. Surprisingly, for finite transverse orbital coupling the long-range spin singlet correlations also coexist in the antiferromagnetic spin and alternating orbital phase making this phase also unconventional. Moreover we also find a complementary orbital singlet phase that exists in the isotropic case but does not extend to the Ising limit. The nature of entanglement appears essentially different from that found in the frequently discussed model with positive coupling. Furthermore we investigate the collective spin and orbital wave excitations of the disentangled ferromagnetic-spin/ferro-orbital ground state and explore the continuum of spin-orbital excitations. Interestingly one finds among the latter excitations two modes of exciton bound states. Their spin-orbital correlations differ from the remaining continuum states and exhibit logarithmic scaling of the von Neumann entropy with increasing system size.

abstract: In electron scattering, the target form factors contribute significantly to the diffraction pattern and carry information on the target electromagnetic charge distribution. Here we show that the presence of electromagnetic radiation, as intense as currently available in Free Electron Lasers, shifts the dependence of the target form factors by a quantity that depends on the number of photons absorbed or emitted by the electron as well as on the parameters of the electromagnetic radiation. As example, we show the impact of intense ultraviolet and soft X-ray radiation on elastic electron scattering by Ne-like Argon ion and by Xenon atom. We find that the shift brought by the radiation to the form factor is in the order of some percent. Our results may open up a new avenue to explore matter with the assistance of laser.

abstract: The problem of recovering a matrix of low rank from an incomplete and possibly noisy set of linear measurements arises in a number of areas. In order to derive rigorous recovery results, the measurement map is usually modeled probabilistically. We derive sufficient conditions on the minimal amount of measurements ensuring recovery via convex optimization. We establish our results via certain properties of the null space of the measurement map. In the setting where the measurements are realized as Frobenius inner products with independent standard Gaussian random matrices we show that $10 r (n_1 + n_2)$ measurements are enough to uniformly and stably recover an $n_1 \times n_2$ matrix of rank at most $r$. We then significantly generalize this result by only requiring independent mean-zero, variance one entries with four finite moments at the cost of replacing $10$ by some universal constant. We also study the case of recovering Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices from measurement matrices proportional to rank-one projectors. For $m \geq C r n$ rank-one projective measurements onto independent standard Gaussian vectors, we show that nuclear norm minimization uniformly and stably reconstructs Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices with high probability. Next, we partially de-randomize this by establishing an analogous statement for projectors onto independent elements of a complex projective 4-designs at the cost of a slightly higher sampling rate $m \geq C rn \log n$. Moreover, if the Hermitian matrix to be recovered is known to be positive semidefinite, then we show that the nuclear norm minimization approach may be replaced by minimizing the $\ell_2$-norm of the residual subject to the positive semidefinite constraint. Then no estimate of the noise level is required a priori. We discuss applications in quantum physics and the phase retrieval problem.

abstract: Determining the trace of a matrix that is implicitly available through a function is a computationally challenging task that arises in a number of applications. For the common function of the inverse of a large, sparse matrix, the standard approach is based on a Monte Carlo method which converges slowly. We present a different approach by exploiting the pattern correlation between the diagonal of the inverse of the matrix and the diagonal of some approximate inverse that can be computed inexpensively. We leverage various sampling and fitting techniques to fit the diagonal of the approximation to the diagonal of the inverse. Based on a dynamic evaluation of the variance, the proposed method can be used as a variance reduction method for Monte Carlo in some cases. Furthermore, the presented method may serve as a standalone kernel for providing a fast trace estimate with a small number of samples. An extensive set of experiments with various technique combinations demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in some real applications.

abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) is a promising method for large-scale quantum mechanics simulation as it provides a good balance of accuracy and computational cost. Its applicability to large-scale simulations has been aided by progress in constructing kinetic energy functionals and local pseudopotentials. However, the widespread adoption of OF-DFT requires further improvement in its efficiency and robustly implemented software. Here we develop a real-space finite-difference method for the numerical solution of OF-DFT in periodic systems. Instead of the traditional self-consistent method, a powerful scheme for energy minimization is introduced to solve the Euler--Lagrange equation. Our approach engages both the real-space finite-difference method and a direct energy-minimization scheme for the OF-DFT calculations. The method is coded into the ATLAS software package and benchmarked using periodic systems of solid Mg, Al, and Al$_{3}$Mg. The test results show that our implementation can achieve high accuracy, efficiency, and numerical stability for large-scale simulations.

abstract: We present power-law relaxation behavior of the local magnetizations in the equilibration dynamics of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg spin chain as an isolated integrable quantum system. We perform the exact time evolution of the expectation values of the local spin operators by evaluating them with the determinant formula of the form factors. We construct such an initial quantum state that has a localized profile of the local magnetizations, and perform the exact time evolution over a very long period of time. We show that the local magnetization relaxes as some power of the time variable with no definite time scale, while the fidelity relaxes very fast with its relaxation time being proportional to the inverse of the energy width, i.e. the Boltzmann time.

abstract: Laser spectroscopy of cold and trapped molecular ions is a powerful tool for fundamental physics, including the determination of fundamental constants, the laboratory test for their possible variation, and the search for a possible electric dipole moment of the electron. Optical clocks based on molecular ions sensitive to some of these effects are expected to achieve uncertainties approaching the $10^{-18}$ level. While the complexity of molecular structure facilitates these applications, the absence of cycling transitions poses a challenge for direct laser cooling, quantum state control, and detection. Previously employed state detection techniques based on photo-dissociation or chemical reactions are destructive and therefore inefficient. Here we experimentally demonstrate non-destructive state detection of a single trapped molecular ion through its strong Coulomb coupling to a well-controlled co-trapped atomic ion. An algorithm based on a state-dependent optical dipole force(ODF) changes the internal state of the atom conditioned on the internal state of the molecule. We show that individual states in the molecule can be distinguished by their coupling strength to the ODF and observe black-body radiation-induced quantum jumps between rotational states. Using the detuning dependence of the state detection signal, we implement a variant of quantum logic spectroscopy and improve upon a previous measurement of the $\mathrm{X}^1\Sigma^+(J=1)\rightarrow\mathrm{A}^1\Sigma^+(J=0)$ transition in MgH, finding a frequency of 1067.74752(53)THz. We estimate that non-destructive state detection with near 100% efficiency could take less than 10 ms. The technique we demonstrate is applicable to a wide range of molecular ions, enabling further applications in state-controlled quantum chemistry and spectroscopic investigations of molecules serving as probes for interstellar clouds.

abstract: Yield Optimized Interpolated Superoscillations (YOIS) have been recently introduced as a means for possibly making the use of the phenomenon of superoscillation practical. In this paper we study how good is a superoscillation that is not optimal. Namely, by how much is the yield decreased when the signal departs from the optimal one. We consider two situations. One is the case where the signal strictly obeys the interpolation requirement and the other is when that requirement is relaxed. In the latter case the yield can be increased at the expense of deterioration of signal quality. An important conclusion is that optimizing superoscillations may be challenging in terms of the precision needed, however, storing and using them is not at that sensitive. This is of great importance in physical systems where noise and error are inevitable.

abstract: A quantum annealer heuristically minimizes quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, but is limited by the physical hardware in the size and density of the problems it can handle. We have developed a meta-heuristic solver that utilizes D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer (or any other QUBO problem optimizer) to solve larger or denser problems, by iteratively solving subproblems, while keeping the rest of the variables fixed. We present our algorithm, several variants, and the results for the optimization of standard QUBO problem instances from OR-Library of sizes 500 and 2500 as well as the Palubeckis instances of sizes 3000 to 7000. For practical use of the solver, we show the dependence of the time to best solution on the desired gap to the best known solution. In addition, we study the dependence of the gap and the time to best solution on the size of the problems solved by the underlying optimizer.

abstract: Unidirectional and robust transport is generally observed at the edge of two- or three-dimensional quantum Hall and topological insulator systems. A hallmark of these systems is topological protection, i.e. the existence of propagative edge states that cannot be scattered by imperfections or disorder in the system. A different and less explored form of robust transport arises in non-Hermitian systems in the presence of an {\it imaginary} gauge field. As compared to topologically-protected transport in quantum Hall and topological insulator systems, robust non-Hermitian transport can be observed in {\it lower} dimensional (i.e. one dimensional) systems. In this work the transport properties of one-dimensional tight-binding lattices with an imaginary gauge field are theoretically investigated, and the physical mechanism underlying robust one-way transport is highlighted. Back scattering is here forbidden because reflected waves are evanescent rather than propagative. Remarkably, the spectral transmission of the non-Hermitian lattice is shown to be mapped into the one of the corresponding Hermitian lattice, i.e. without the gauge field, {\it but} computed in the complex plane. In particular, at large values of the gauge field the spectral transmittance becomes equal to one, even in the presence of disorder or lattice imperfections. This phenomenon can be referred to as {\it one-way non-Hermitian transparency}. Robust one-way transport can be also realized in a more realistic setting, namely in heterostructure systems, in which a non-Hermitian disordered lattice is embedded between two homogeneous Hermitian lattices. Such a double heterostructure realizes asymmetric (non-reciprocal) wave transmission. A physical implementation of non-Hermtian transparency, based on light transport in a chain of optical microring resonators, is suggested.

abstract: Recently, a new connection between density functional theory and kinetic theory has been proposed. In particular, it was shown that the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations can be reformulated as a macroscopic limit of the steady-state solution of a suitable single-particle kinetic equation. By using a discrete version of this new formalism, the exchange and correlation energies of simple atoms and the geometrical configuration of the methane molecule were calculated accurately. Here, we discuss the main ideas behind the lattice kinetic approach to electronic structure computations, offer some considerations for prospective extensions, and also show additional numerical results, namely the geometrical configuration of the water molecule.

abstract: A comprehensive experimental investigation of exciton and biexciton recombination in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells is presented. Exciton and biexciton recombination times are found to be 16 and 55 ps, respectively. A method of determining the dynamics of the exciton temperature is developed. It is shown that both exciton and biexciton recombination processes increase the exciton temperature by an amount as high as $\sim 10$ K. These processes impose a new restriction on the possibility of exciton Bose-Einstein condensation and make impossible its achievement in a system of direct excitons in GaAs quantum wells even for resonantly excited exciton gas.

abstract: The neutral biexciton cascade of single quantum dots is a promising source of entangled photon pairs. The character of the entangled state is determined by the energy difference between the excitonic eigenstates known as fine-structure splitting (FSS). Here we reduce the magnitude of the FSS by simultaneously using two independent tuning mechanisms: in-plane magnetic field and vertical electric field. We observe that there exists a minimum possible FSS in each quantum dot which is independent of these tuning mechanisms. However, with simultaneous application of electric and magnetic fields, we show the FSS can be reduced to its minimum value as the energy of emission is tuned over several meV with a 5-T magnet.

abstract: We study the class of self-similar probability density functions with finite mean and variance which maximize R\'{e}nyi's entropy. The investigation is restricted in the Schwartz space $S(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and in the space of $l$-differentiable compactly supported functions $C_c^l(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Interestingly the solutions of this optimization problem do not coincide with the solutions of the usual porous medium equation with a Dirac point source, as it occurs in the optimization of Shannon's entropy. We also study the concavity of the entropy power in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to time using two different methods. The first one takes advantage of the solutions determined earlier while the second one is based on a setting that could be used for Riemannian manifolds.

abstract: We study relaxation times, also called mixing times, of quantum many-body systems described by a Lindblad master equation. We in particular study the scaling of the spectral gap with the system length, the so-called dynamical exponent, identifying a number of transitions in the scaling. For systems with bulk dissipation we generically observe different scaling for small and for strong dissipation strength, with a critical transition strength going to zero in the thermodynamic limit. We also study a related phase transition in the largest decay mode. For systems with only boundary dissipation we show that the gap can not be larger than 1/L. In integrable systems with boundary dissipation one typically observes scaling 1/L^3, while in chaotic ones one can have faster relaxation with the gap scaling as 1/L. We also observe transition from exponential to algebraic gap in systems with localized edge modes.

abstract: The Aharonov--Bohm (AB) problem for vector bosons by the Duffin--Kemmer--Petiau (DKP) formalism is analyzed. The relevant eigenvalue equation coming from the DKP formalism reveals an equivalence to the spin--$1/2$ AB problem. By using the self--adjoint extension approach, we examine the bound state scenario. The energy spectra are explicitly computed as well as their dependencies on the magnetic flux parameter and also the conditions for the occurrence of bound states.

abstract: Exploiting quantum properties to outperform classical ways of information-processing is an outstanding goal of modern physics. A promising route is quantum simulation which aims at implementing relevant and computationally hard problems in controllable quantum systems. Here we consider trapped ions which have proven very flexible for realizing the physics of interacting spins. We demonstrate concretely that, with present day technology, a spin model of the Mattis type can be obtained, that exhibits spin glass phases. Remarkably, our method produces the glassy behaviour without the need of any disorder potential, just by controlling the detuning of the spin-phonon coupling. Applying a transverse field, the system can be used to benchmark quantum annealing strategies which aim at reaching the ground state of the spin glass starting from the paramagnetic phase. In the vicinity of a phonon resonance, the problem maps onto number partitioning, and instances which are difficult to address classically can be implemented.

abstract: Starting from the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), we generalize the schematic model of separable interaction defning subspaces of ph excitations with different coupling constants between them. This ansatz simplifies the RPA eigenvalue problem to a finite, small dimensional system of equations which reduces the numerical effort. Associated dispersion relation and the normalization condition are derived for the new defined unknowns of the system. In contrast with the standard separable approach, the present formalism is able to describe more than one collective excitation even in the degenerate limit. The theoretical framework is applied to neutral and singly charged spherical sodium clusters and C60 fullerene with results in good agreement with full RPA calculations and experimental data.

abstract: We revisit the problem of full counting statistics of particles on a segment of a one-dimensional gas of free fermions. Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we study the crossover between the counting of discrete particles and of the continuous particle density as a function of smoothing in the counting procedure. In the discrete-particle limit, the result is given by the Fisher--Hartwig expansion for Toeplitz determinants, while in the continuous limit we recover the bosonization results. This example of full counting statistics with smoothing is also related to orthogonality catastrophe, Fermi-edge singularity and non-equilibrium bosonization.

abstract: We report an experimental measurement of a light wavelength at which the ac electric polarizability equals zero for 87Rb atoms in the F=2 ground hyperfine state. The experiment uses a condensate interferometer both to find this 'tune-out' wavelength and to accurately determine the light polarization for it. The wavelength lies between the D1 and D2 spectral lines at 790.03235(3) nm. The measurement is sensitive to the tensor contribution to the polarizability, which has been removed so that the reported value is the zero of the scalar polarizability. The precision is fifty times better than previous tune-out wavelength measurements. Our result can be used to determine the ratio of matrix elements |<5P3/2||d||5S1/2>/<5P1/2||d||5S1/2>|^2 = 1.99219(3), a 100-fold improvement over previous experimental values. Both the tune-out wavelength and matrix element ratio are consistent with theoretical calculations, with uncertainty estimates for the theory about an order of magnitude larger than the experimental precision.

abstract: Superconducting circuits offer tremendous design flexibility in the quantum regime culminating most recently in the demonstration of few qubit systems supposedly approaching the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. Competition in the solid-state comes from semiconductor qubits, where nature has bestowed some almost magical and very useful properties which can be utilized for spin qubit based quantum computing. Here we begin to explore how selective design principles deduced from spin-based systems could be used to advance superconducting qubit science. We take an initial step along this path proposing an encoded qubit approach realizable with state-of-the-art tunable Josephson junction qubits. Our results show that this design philosophy holds promise, enables microwave-free control with minimal overhead (zero overhead in 2-qubit gates), and offers a pathway to future qubit designs with new capabilities such as with higher fidelity or, perhaps, operation at higher temperature. The approach is especially suited to qubits based on variable super-semi junctions.

abstract: We show how to achieve optical, spin-selective transitions from the ground state to excited orbital states of group-V donors (P, As, Sb, Bi) in silicon. We consider two approaches based on either resonant, far-infrared (IR) transitions of the neutral donor or resonant, near-IR excitonic transitions. For far-IR light, we calculate the dipole matrix elements between the valley-orbit and spin-orbit split states for all the goup-V donors using effective mass theory. We then calculate the maximum rate and amount of electron-nuclear spin-polarization achievable through optical pumping with circularly polarized light. We find this approach is most promising for Bi donors due to their large spin-orbit and valley-orbit interactions. Using near-IR light, spin-selective excitation is possible for all the donors by driving a two-photon $\Lambda$-transition from the ground state to higher orbitals with even parity. We show that externally applied electric fields or strain allow similar, spin-selective $\Lambda$-transition to odd-parity excited states. We anticipate these results will be useful for future spectroscopic investigations of donors, quantum control and state preparation of donor spin qubits, and for developing a coherent interface between donor spin qubits and single photons.

We focus here on the adiabatic electronic potentials evolving from the Rb($n, l\ge 3$) and Rb($n=26, l=2$) manifolds. The directional properties of the KRb diatomic molecule within the Rb-KRb triatomic Rydberg molecule are also analyzed in detail.

abstract: We consider two identical impurities immersed in a Fermi sea for a broad range of masses and for both interacting and non-interacting impurities. The interaction between the particles is described through attractive zero-range potentials and the problem is solved in momentum space. The two impurities can attach to a fermion from the sea and form three-body bound states. The energy of these states increase as function of the Fermi momentum $k_F$, leading to three-body bound states below the Fermi energy. The fate of the states depends highly on two- and three-body thresholds and we find evidence of medium-induced Borromean-like states in 2D. The corrections due to particle-hole fluctuations in the Fermi sea are considered in the three-body calculations and we show that in spite of the fact that they strongly affect both the two- and three-body systems, the correction to the point at which the three-body states cease to exist is small.

abstract: The Fock-Hilbert space generated by a single-particle interaction-free Wightman field is augmented by introducing non-trivial multi-particle (that is, multi-point) field operators in a way that satisfies the Haag-Kastler axioms, which is justified insofar as Haag's theorem establishes that free field Fock-Hilbert spaces cannot model bound or interacting states. The 2-particle and 3-particle cases are special in 3+1-dimensions because a time-like 4-vector cannot be constructed that is orthogonal to more than three arbitrarily chosen space-like 4-vectors.

abstract: We present perturbative analytical results of the Landau level quasienergy spectrum, autocorrelation function and out of plane pseudospin polarization for a single graphene sheet subject to intense circularly polarized terahertz radiation. For the quasienergy spectrum, we find a striking non trivial level-dependent dynamically induced gap structure. This photoinduced modulation of the energy band structure gives rise to shifts of the revival times in the autocorrelation function and it also leads to modulation of the oscillations in the dynamical evolution of the out of plane pseudospin polarization, which measures the angular momentum transfer between light and graphene electrons. For a coherent state, chosen as an initial pseudospin configuration, the dynamics induces additional quantum revivals of the wave function that manifest as shifts of the maxima and minima of the autocorrelation function, with additional partial revivals and beating patterns. These additional maxima and beating patterns stem from the effective dynamical coupling of the static eigenstates. We discuss the possible experimental detection schemes of our theoretical results and their relevance in new practical implementation of radiation fields in graphene physics.

abstract: As a test of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) of defect formation, we simulate the Bose-Einstein condensation transition in a toroidally confined Bose gas using the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE), with and without the energy-damping reservoir interaction. Energy-damping alters the scaling of the winding number distribution with the quench time - a departure from the universal KZM theory that relies on equilibrium critical exponents. Numerical values are obtained for the correlation-length critical exponent $\nu$ and the dynamical critical exponent $z$ for each variant of reservoir interaction theory. The energy-damping reservoir interactions cause significant modification of the dynamical critical exponent of the phase transition, whilst preserving the essential KZM critical scaling behavior. Comparison of numerical and analytical two-point correlation functions further illustrates the effect of energy damping on the correlation length during freeze out.

abstract: Defect centers in diamond are exceptional solid-state quantum systems that can have exceedingly long electron and nuclear spin coherence times. So far, single-qubit gates for the nitrogen nuclear spin, a two-qubit gate with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin, and entanglement between nearby nitrogen nuclear spins have been demonstrated. Here, we develop a scheme to implement a universal two-qubit gate between two distant nitrogen nuclear spins. Virtual excitation of an NV center that is embedded in an optical cavity can scatter a laser photon into the cavity mode; we show that this process depends on the nuclear spin state of the nitrogen atom. If two NV centers are simultaneously coupled to a common cavity mode and individually excited, virtual cavity photon exchange can mediate an effective interaction between the nuclear spin qubits, conditioned on the spin state of both nuclei, which implements a universal controlled-$\textit{Z}$ gate. We predict operation times below 100 nanoseconds, which is several orders of magnitude faster than the decoherence time of nuclear spin qubits in diamond.

Such a condition is important to ensure variational stability in algorithms based on the first-quantized Dirac theory of 1/2-fermions. We demonstrate that the kinetic-balance condition can be obtained from the row reduction process commonly applied to solve systems of linear equations. The resulting form of kinetic balance establishes a relation for the $4^N$ components of the spinor of an $N$-fermion system to the non-relativistic limit, which is in accordance with recent developments in the field of exact decoupling in relativistic orbital-based many-electron theory.

abstract: We show how to compute the optical functions of Wide Parabolic Quantum Wells (WPQWs) exposed to uniform electric F applied in the growth direction, in the excitonic energy region. The effect of the coherence between the electron-hole pair and the electromagnetic field of the propagating wave including the electron-hole screened Coulomb potential is adopted, and the valence band structure is taken into account in the cylindrical approximation. The role of the interaction potential and of the applied electric field, which mix the energy states according to different quantum numbers and create symmetry forbidden transitions, is stressed. We use the Real Density Matrix Approach (RDMA) and an effective e-h potential, which enable to derive analytical expressions for the WPQWs electrooptical functions. Choosing the susceptibility, we performed numerical calculations appropriate to a GaAs/GaAlAs WPQWs. We have obtained a red shift of the absorption maxima (Quantum Confined Stark Effect), asymmetric upon the change of the direction of the applied field (F -> -F), parabolic for the ground state and strongly dependent on the confinement parameters (the QWs sizes), changes in the oscillator strengths, and new peaks related to the states with different parity for electron and hole.

abstract: We investigate the potential energy curves of rare-gas dimers with various ranges and strengths of interparticle interactions (nuclear-electron, electron-electron, and nuclear-nuclear interactions). Our investigation is based on the highly accurate coupled-cluster theory associated with those interparticle interactions. For comparison, the performance of the corresponding Hartree-Fock theory, second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory, and density functional theory is also investigated. Our results reveal that when the interparticle interactions retain the long-range Coulomb tails, the nature of van der Waals interactions in the rare-gas dimers remains similar. By contrast, when the interparticle interactions are sufficiently short-range, the conventional van der Waals interactions in the rare-gas dimers completely disappear, yielding purely repulsive potential energy curves.

abstract: We study dynamical phases of a driven Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to the light field of a high-Q optical cavity. For high field seeking atoms at red detuning the system is known to show a transition from a spatially homogeneous steady-state to a self-organized regular lattice exhibiting super-radiant scattering into the cavity. For blue atom pump detuning the particles are repelled from the maxima of the light-induced optical potential suppressing scattering. We show that this generates a new dynamical instability of the self-ordered phase, leading to the appearance of self-ordered stable limit-cycles characterized by large amplitude self-sustained oscillations of both the condensate density and cavity field. The limit-cycles evolve into chaotic behavior by period doubling. Large amplitude oscillations of the condensate are accompanied by phase-slippage through soliton nucleation at a rate which increases by orders of magnitude in the chaotic regime. Different from a superfluid in a closed setup, this driven dissipative superfluid is not destroyed by the proliferation of solitons since kinetic energy is removed through cavity losses.

abstract: The saddle point approximation of the path integral partition functions is an important way of deriving the thermodynamical properties of black holes. However, there are certain black hole models and some mathematically analog mechanical models for which this method can not be applied directly. This is due to the fact that their action evaluated on a classical solution is not finite and its first variation does not vanish for all consistent boundary conditions. These problems can be dealt with by adding a counter-term to the classical action, which is a solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work we study the effects of polymer quantization on a mechanical model presenting the aforementioned difficulties and contrast it with the above counter-term method. This type of quantization for mechanical models is motivated by the loop quantization of gravity which is known to play a role in the thermodynamics of black holes systems. The model we consider is a non relativistic particle in an inverse square potential and analyze two polarizations of the polymer quantization in which either the position or the momentum is discrete. In the former case, Thiemann's regularization is applied to represent the inverse power potential but we still need to incorporate the Hamilton-Jacobi counter-term which is now modified by polymer corrections. In the latter, momentum discrete case however, such regularization could not be implemented. Yet, remarkably, due to the fact that the position is bounded, we do not need a Hamilton-Jacobi counter-term in order to have a well defined saddle point approximation. Further developments and extensions are commented upon in the discussion.

This result should be important for planning and interpreting the Casimir measurements, especially taking into account that the Casimir interaction of undoped graphene is rather weak.

Since space and time should be put on an equal footing, we generalize the idea of quantum clock time to a quantum spacetime reference frame via a physical realization of a reference system by quantum rulers and clocks. Omitting the internal degrees of freedoms (e.g. spin) of the physical rulers and clocks, only considering their metric properties, the spacetime reference frame is described by a bosonic non-linear sigma model. We study the quantum behavior of the system under given approximations, and obtain (1) a cosmological constant $(2/\pi)\rho_{c}$ ($\rho_{c}$ the critical density) very close to current observational value; (2) an Einstein-Hilbert term in the quantum effective action; (3) the ratio of variance to mean-squared of spacetime distance tends to a universal constant $(2/\pi)\hbar^{2}$ in the infrared region. This effect is testable by observing the linear dependence between the variance and mean-squared of the redshifts from distant spectral lines. The proportional coefficient is expected to be identical to the percentage of dark energy $\Omega_{\Lambda}=2/\pi$. We also argue that the equivalence principle still holds for the quantum phenomenon.

abstract: We consider a single impurity with spin $S$ embedded in a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic system which is close to the quantum critical point (QCP), separating magnetically ordered and disordered phases. Approaching the QCP from the disordered phase we study the spatial distribution of spin density and staggered magnetization induced by the impurity. Using two methods (self-consistent Born approximation and renormalization group) we found a power law decay of the spin density $\propto 1/r^3$, and of the staggered magnetization $\propto 1/r$ with relevant logarithmic corrections. We demonstrate that the local spin at the impurity site $r=0$ approaches to zero at the QCP. We show that in the semiclassical limit of large $S$ the problem is equivalent to the exactly solvable independent boson model. Our results demonstrate existence of spin-charge separation in the three dimensional systems in the vicinity of the QCP.

abstract: In this paper we propose an extended particle model whose evolution is deterministic. In dimension 2, the extended particle is represented by four points that define a small elastic string that vibrates, alternating between a creation process and an annihilation process. First we show how the spin and the Heisenberg uncertainty relations emerge from this extended particle. We then show how the complex action associated with this extended particle satisfies, from a generalized principle of least action, a second order complex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Third, we show that the wave function, which admits this action as a complex phase, satisfies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Finally, we show that the gravity center of this extended particle follows the trajectories proposed by the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation well as the Schr{\"o}dinger interpretation. This model is built on two new mathematical concepts we have introduced: complex analytical mechanics on complex-valued functions and a periodic deterministic process.

abstract: We evaluate the Hadamard function and the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field, induced by flat boundaries in spacetimes with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. The field operator obeys the Robin conditions on the boundaries and quasiperiodicity conditions with general phases along compact dimensions. In addition, the presence of a constant gauge field is assumed. The latter induces Aharonov-Bohm-type effect on the VEVs. There is a region in the space of the parameters in Robin boundary conditions where the vacuum state becomes unstable. The stability condition depends on the lengths of compact dimensions and is less restrictive than that for background with trivial topology. The vacuum current density is a periodic function of the magnetic flux, enclosed by compact dimensions, with the period equal to the flux quantum. It is explicitly decomposed into the boundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. In sharp contrast to the VEVs of the field squared and the energy-momentum tensor, the current density does not contain surface divergences. Moreover, for Dirichlet condition it vanishes on the boundaries. The normal derivative of the current density on the boundaries vanish for both Dirichlet and Neumann conditions and is nonzero for general Robin conditions. When the separation between the plates is smaller than other length scales, the behavior of the current density is essentially different for non-Neumann and Neumann boundary conditions. In the former case, the total current density in the region between the plates tends to zero. For Neumann boundary condition on both plates, the current density is dominated by the interference part and is inversely proportional to the separation.

abstract: Polarized cross-correlation spectroscopy on a quantum dot charged with a single hole shows the sequential emission of photons with common circular polarization. This effect is visible without magnetic field, but becomes more pronounced as the field along the quantization axis is increased. We interpret the data in terms of electron dephasing in the X+ state caused by the Overhauser field of nuclei in the dot. We predict the correlation timescale can be increased by accelerating the emission rate with cavity-QED.

abstract: In cavity optomechanics, light is used to control mechanical motion. A central goal of the field is achieving single-photon strong coupling, which would enable the creation of quantum superposition states of motion. Reaching this limit requires significant improvements in optomechanical coupling and cavity coherence. Here we introduce an optomechanical architecture consisting of a silicon nitride membrane coupled to a three-dimensional superconducting microwave cavity. Exploiting their large quality factors, we achieve an optomechanical cooperativity of 146,000 and perform sideband cooling of the kilohertz-frequency membrane motion to 34$\pm$5 $\mu$K, the lowest mechanical mode temperature reported to date. The achieved cooling is limited only by classical noise of the signal generator, and should extend deep into the ground state with superconducting filters. Our results suggest that this realization of optomechanics has the potential to reach the regimes of ultra-large cooperativity and single-photon strong coupling, opening up a new generation of experiments.

abstract: Recent ideas about understanding physics of black hole information-processing in terms of quantum criticality allow us to implement black hole mechanisms of quantum computing within critical Bose-Einstein systems. The generic feature, uncovered both by analytic and numeric studies, is the emergence at the critical point of gapless weakly-interacting modes, which act as qubits for information-storage at a very low energy cost. These modes can be effectively described in terms of either Bogoliubov or Goldstone degrees of freedom. The ground-state at the critical point is maximally entangled and far from being classical. We confirm this near-critical behavior by a new analytic method. We compute growth of entanglement and show its consistency with black hole type behavior. On the other hand, in the over-critical regime the system develops a Lyapunov exponent and scrambles quantum information very fast. By, manipulating the system parameters externally, we can put it in and out of various regimes and in this way control the sequence of information storage and processing. By using gapless Bogoliubov modes as control qubits we design some simple logic gates.

abstract: We consider quantum Hamiltonians of the form $H = H_0 - U \sum_j \cos(C_j)$ where $H_0$ is a quadratic function of position and momentum variables $\{x_1, p_1, x_2, p_2,...\}$ and the $C_j$'s are linear in these variables. We allow $H_0$ and $C_j$ to be completely general with only two restrictions: we require that (1) the $C_j$'s are linearly independent and (2) $[C_j, C_k]$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi i$ for all $j,k$ so that the different cosine terms commute with one another. Our main result is a recipe for solving these Hamiltonians and obtaining their exact low energy spectrum in the limit $U \rightarrow \infty$. This recipe involves constructing creation and annihilation operators and is similar in spirit to the procedure for diagonalizing quadratic Hamiltonians. In addition to our exact solution in the infinite $U$ limit, we also discuss how to analyze these systems when $U$ is large but finite. Our results are relevant to a number of different physical systems, but one of the most natural applications is to understanding the effects of electron scattering on quantum Hall edge modes. To demonstrate this application, we use our formalism to solve a toy model for a fractional quantum spin Hall edge with different types of impurities.

abstract: In this report we introduce Parity-Time (PT) symmetric perturbation to a one-dimensional Lieb lattice, which is otherwise P-symmetric and has a flat band. In the flat band there are a multitude of degenerate dark states, and the degeneracy N increases with the system size. The half-gain-half-loss perturbation we consider overlaps with the dark states, and we show that both randomly positioned states and pinned states at the symmetry plane in the flat band can undergo thresholdless PT breaking. They are distinguished by their different rates of acquiring non-Hermicity as the PT-symmetric perturbation grows, which are insensitive to the system size. Using a degenerate perturbation theory, we derive analytically the rate for the pinned states, whose spatial profiles are also insensitive to the system size. Finally, we find that the presence of weak disorder has a strong effect on modes in the dispersive bands but not on those in the flat band. The latter response in completely different ways to the growing PT-symmetric perturbation, depending on whether they are randomly positioned or pinned.
