abstract: We investigate the discrete-time quantum walk evolution under the influence of the periodic measurements in position subspace. The undisturbed survival probability of the particle at the position subspace, $P(0, t)$ is compared with the survival probability after frequent ($n$) measurements at interval $\tau = t/n$, $P(0, \tau)^n$. We show that $P(0, \tau)^n > P(0, t)$ leading to the quantum Zeno effect in the position subspace when a parameter $\theta$ in the quantum coin operations and frequency of measurements is greater than the critical value, $\theta > \theta_{c}$ and $n>n_{c}$. This Zeno effect in the subspace preserves the dynamics in coin Hilbert space of the walk dynamics and has a potential to play a significant role in quantum tasks such as, preserving the quantum state of the particle at any particular position and to understand the Zeno dynamics in a multidimensional system which is highly transient in nature.

abstract: Quantum computers are susceptible to noises from the outside world. We investigate the effect of perturbation on the hitting time of a quantum walk and the stationary distribution prepared by a quantum walk based algorithm. The perturbation comes from quantizing a transition matrix Q with perturbation E (errors). We bound the perturbed quantum walk hitting time from above by applying Szegedy's work and the perturbation bounds with Weyl's perturbation theorem on classical matrix. Based on an efficient quantum sample preparation approach invented in {\em speed-up via quantum sampling} and the perturbation bounds for stationary distribution for classical matrix, we find an upper bound for the total variation distance between the prepared quantum sample and the true quantum sample.

abstract: Consider a discrete-time quantum walk on the $N$-cycle governed by the following condition: at every time step of the walk, the option persists, with probability $p$, of exercising a projective measurement on the coin degree of freedom. For a bipartite quantum system of this kind, we prove that the von Neumann entropy of the total density operator converges to its maximum value. Thus, when influenced by decoherence, the mutual information between the two subsystems, corresponding respectively to the space of the coin and the space of the walker, eventually must diminish to zero. To put it plainly, any level of decoherence greater than zero forces the system eventually to become completely "disentangled".}

abstract: We have calculated the low-lying elementary excitations of three-dimensional few-vortex arrays in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates. The number of different Kelvin-Tkachenko vortex wave branches matches the number of vortices in the condensate. The lowest odd-parity modes exhibit superfluid gyroscopic vortex motion. Experimentally, these modes could be excited and observed individually or in connection with the formation and decay of quantum turbulence.

abstract: We have computed phase diagrams for rotating spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. Spin textures including vortex sheets, staggered half-quantum- and skyrmion vortex lattices and higher order topological defects have been found. These systems exhibit both superfluidity and magnetic crystalline ordering and they could be realized experimentally by imparting angular momentum in the condensate.
