abstract: We use quantum walks to construct a new quantum algorithm for element distinctness and its generalization. For element distinctness (the problem of finding two equal items among N given items), we get an O(N^{2/3}) query quantum algorithm. This improves the previous O(N^{3/4}) query quantum algorithm of Buhrman et.al. (quant-ph/0007016) and matches the lower bound by Shi (quant-ph/0112086). The algorithm also solves the generalization of element distinctness in which we have to find k equal items among N items. For this problem, we get an O(N^{k/(k+1)}) query quantum algorithm.

abstract: We show that the solution obtained by Bekkar {\it et al.} in their comment [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 68}, 016101 (2003)] on Guedes's work of solving the quantum system with a time-dependent linear potential is still {\it not} the {\it general} one of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. It is concluded that Bekkar {\it et al.}'s solution (corresponding to the linear Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant) and our solution (corresponding to the quadratic-form Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant) presented here will constitute together a complete set of solutions (general solutions) of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the system under consideration.

abstract: Two observations are given on the fidelity of schemes for quantum information processing. In the first one, we show that the fidelity of a symplectic (stabilizer) code, if properly defined, exactly equals the `probability' of the correctable errors for general quantum channels. The second observation states that for any coding rate below the quantum capacity, exponential convergence of the fidelity of some codes to unity is possible.

abstract: A general study of arbitrary finite-size coherent attacks against continuous-variable quantum cryptographic schemes is presented. It is shown that, if the size of the blocks that can be coherently attacked by an eavesdropper is fixed and much smaller than the key size, then the optimal attack for a given signal-to-noise ratio in the transmission line is an individual gaussian attack. Consequently, non-gaussian coherent attacks do not need to be considered in the security analysis of such quantum cryptosystems.

We pay special attention to two probabilities, where we show specific query and error lower bounds and the algorithms that achieve them. We also study the worst expected error and the average expected error of quantum algorithms and show the respective query lower bounds. Our results extend the optimality of the algorithm of Brassard et al.

abstract: The design and optimization of quantum circuits is central to quantum computation. This paper presents new algorithms for compiling arbitrary 2^n x 2^n unitary matrices into efficient circuits of (n-1)-controlled single-qubit and (n-1)-controlled-NOT gates. We first present a general algebraic optimization technique, which we call the Palindrome Transform, that can be used to minimize the number of self-inverting gates in quantum circuits consisting of concatenations of palindromic subcircuits. For a fixed column ordering of two-level decomposition, we then give an numerative algorithm for minimal (n-1)-controlled-NOT circuit construction, which we call the Palindromic Optimization Algorithm. Our work dramatically reduces the number of gates generated by the conventional two-level decomposition method for constructing quantum circuits of (n-1)-controlled single-qubit and (n-1)-controlled-NOT gates.

Although the corresponding classical random walk is unbiased, a bias can be introduced into the quantum walk by varying the history dependence. By mixing the biased random walk with an unbiased one, the direction of the bias can be reversed leading to a new quantum version of Parrondo's paradox.

In the experiment we have achieved remarkably high fidelities of cloning, 0.848 and 0.844 respectively for the original and the blank qubit. This experimental value is close to the optimal theoretical value of 0.854. We have also demonstrated how to use our phase-covariant cloning machine for quantum simulations of bit by bit eavesdropping in the four-state quantum key distribution protocol.

authors: Kaige Wang
comments: 21 pages, 12 figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311011
abstract: We study a general theory on the interference of a two-photon wavepacket in a beam splitter. The theory is carried out in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture so that the quantum nature of the two-photon interference is explicitly presented. We find that the topological symmetry of the probability-amplitude spectrum of the two-photon wavepacket dominates the manners of two-photon interference which are distinguished according to increasing and decreasing the coincidence probability for the absence of interference. However, two-photon entanglement can be witnessed by the interference manner. We demonstrate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect two-photon interference. For a two-photon entangled state with an anti-symmetric spectrum, it passes a 50/50 beam splitter with the perfect transparency. The theory contributes an unified understanding to a variety of the two-photon interference effects.

abstract: We extend the Collective Atomic Recoil Lasing (CARL) model including the effects of friction and diffusion forces acting on the atoms due to the presence of optical molasses fields. The results from this model are consistent with those from a recent experiment by Kruse et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 183601 (2003)]. In particular, we obtain a threshold condition above which collective backscattering occurs. Using a nonlinear analysis we show that the backscattered field and the bunching evolve to a steady-state, in contrast to the non-stationary behaviour of the standard CARL model. For a proper choice of the parameters, this steady-state can be superfluorescent.

abstract: Alice can distribute a quantum state $|\phi>$ to $N$ spatially separated parties(say Bobs) by telecloning. It is possible for Charlie to reconstruct the quantum state to him if he shares same kind of telecloning quantum channel with Bobs using only LOCC. For N=3 reconstruction can be done faithfully using Smolin's 4 party unlockable bound entangled state as shared channel. In this note we investigate, in multiparty setting, the general structure of quantum channel and protocol by which faithful distribution and concentration of quantum information can be done.

abstract: Fault-tolerant logical operations for qubits encoded by CSS codes are discussed, with emphasis on methods that apply to codes of high rate, encoding k qubits per block with k>1. It is shown that the logical qubits within a given block can be prepared by a single recovery operation in any state whose stabilizer generator separates into X and Z parts. Optimized methods to move logical qubits around and to achieve controlled-not and Toffoli gates are discussed. It is found that the number of time-steps required to complete a fault-tolerant quantum computation is the same when k>1 as when k=1.

abstract: We demonstrate a multipartite protocol to securely distribute and reconstruct a quantum state. A secret quantum state is encoded into a tripartite entangled state and distributed to three players. Any two of the three players are able to reconstruct the state, whilst individual players obtain nothing. We characterize this (2,3) threshold quantum state sharing scheme in terms of fidelity, signal transfer and reconstruction noise. We demonstrate a fidelity averaged over all reconstruction permutations of 0.73, which is achievable only using quantum resources.

abstract: We study the universality of scaling of entanglement in Shor's factoring algorithm and in adiabatic quantum algorithms across a quantum phase transition for both the NP-complete Exact Cover problem as well as the Grover's problem. The analytic result for Shor's algorithm shows a linear scaling of the entropy in terms of the number of qubits, therefore difficulting the possibility of an efficient classical simulation protocol. A similar result is obtained numerically for the quantum adiabatic evolution Exact Cover algorithm, which also shows universality of the quantum phase transition the system evolves nearby. On the other hand, entanglement in Grover's adiabatic algorithm remains a bounded quantity even at the critical point. A classification of scaling of entanglement appears as a natural grading of the computational complexity of simulating quantum phase transitions.

abstract: Quantum game theory offers a lot of interesting questions, and it is relevant to use the quantum information theory to resolve or improve games with lack of information : how to use the power of quantum entanglement to show the superiority of a quantum player that is allowed to use quantum mechanics versus a classical player, how to use quantum communication properties in cooperative games ... But games are also useful to make notions easier to understand, and permit to apprehend easier new ways of reasoning. The objective of this work is to formalize and to study a simple game with qubits using quantum notions of measurement and superposition but keeping a simple formalism so that knowing quantum mechanics is not necessary to play the game. We solve a quantum combinatorial game by giving a winning strategy for it. We also propose a quantisation of a family of combinatorial games.

abstract: Most discussions of decoherence in the literature consider the high-temperature regime but it is also known that, in the presence of dissipation, decoherence can occur even at zero temperature. Whereas most previous investigations all assumed initial decoupling of the quantum system and bath, we consider that the system and environment are entangled at all times. Here, we discuss decoherence for a free particle in an initial Schr\"{o}dinger cat state. Memory effects are incorporated by use of the single relaxation time model (since the oft-used Ohmic model does not give physically correct results).

However, the preponderance of theoretical work on decoherence does not consider the effect of an {\underline{external field}}. Here, we present an analysis of such an effect in the case of the random delta-correlated force discussed by Myatt et al.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311022
abstract: In this paper it is shown that exact decoherence to minimal uncertainty Gaussian pointer states is generic for free quantum particles coupled to a heat bath. More specifically, the paper is concerned with damped free particles linearly coupled under product initial conditions to a heat bath at arbitrary temperature, with arbitrary coupling strength and spectral densities covering the Ohmic, subohmic, and supraohmic regime. Then it is true that there exists a time t_c such that for times t>t_c the state can always be exactly represented as a mixture (convex combination) of particular minimal uncertainty Gaussian states, regardless of and independent from the initial state. This exact `localisation' is hence not a feature specific to high temperatures and weak damping limit, but is rather a generic property of damped free particles.

abstract: An excited-state atom whose emitted light is back-reflected by a distant mirror can experience trapping forces, because the presence of the mirror modifies both the electromagnetic vacuum field and the atom's own radiation reaction field. We demonstrate this mechanical action using a single trapped barium ion. We observe the trapping conditions to be notably altered when the distant mirror is shifted by an optical wavelength. The well-localised barium ion enables the spatial dependence of the forces to be measured explicitly. The experiment has implications for quantum information processing and may be regarded as the most elementary optical tweezers.

abstract: The effect of interference stabilization is shown to exist in a system of two atomic levels coupled by a strong two-color laser field, the two frequencies of which are close to a two-photon Raman-type resonance between the chosen levels, with open channels of one-photon ionization from both of them. We suggest an experiment, in which a rather significant (up to 90%) suppression of ionization can take place and which demonstrates explicitly the interference origin of stabilization. Specific calculations are made for H and He atoms and optimal parameters of a two-color field are found. The physics of the effect and its relation with such well-known phenomena as LICS and population trapping in a three-level system are discussed.

On the other hand, any $l$ maximally entangled states from this set are locally distinguishable if $l(l-1)\le 2d$. The explicit projecting measurements are obtained to locally discriminate these states. As an example, we show that four Werner states are locally indistinguishable.

abstract: We have recently introduced a measure of the bipartite entanglement of identical particles, E_P, based on the principle that entanglement should be accessible for use as a resource in quantum information processing. We show here that particle entanglement is limited by the lack of a reference phase shared by the two parties, and that the entanglement is constrained to reference-phase invariant subspaces. The super-additivity of E_P results from the fact that this constraint is weaker for combined systems. A shared reference phase can only be established by transferring particles between the parties, that is, with additional nonlocal resources. We show how this nonlocal operation can increase the particle entanglement.

In addition they display such non-classical fluctuation properties as super-Poissonian statistics and squeezing.

abstract: Accurate control of quantum evolution is an essential requirement for quantum state engineering, laser chemistry, quantum information and quantum computing. Conditions of controllability for systems with a finite number of energy levels have been extensively studied. By contrast, results for controllability in infinite dimensions have been mostly negative, stating that full control cannot be achieved with a finite dimensional control Lie algebra. Here we show that by adding a discrete operation to a Lie algebra it is possible to obtain full control in infinite dimensions with a small number of control operators.

abstract: We consider a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment based on the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. Since the development of the causal interpretation of relativistic boson fields there have not been any applications for which the equations of motion for the field have been solved explicitly. Here, we provide perhaps the first application of the causal interpretation of boson fields for which the equations of motion are solved. Specifically, we consider the electromagnetic field. Solving the equations of motion allows us to develop a relativistic causal model of the Wheeler delayed-choice Mach-Zehnder Interferometer. We show explicitly that a photon splits at a beam splitter. We also demonstrate the inherent nonlocal nature of a relativistic quantum field. This is particularly revealed in a which-path measurement where a quantum is nonlocally absorbed from both arms of the interferometer. This feature explains how when a photon is split by a beam splitter it nevertheless registers on a detector in one arm of the interferometer. Bohm et al \cite{BDH85} have argued that a causal model of a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment avoids the paradox of creating or changing history, but they did not provide the details of such a model. The relativistic causal model we develop here serves as a detailed example which demonstrates this point, though our model is in terms of a field picture rather than the particle picture of the Bohm-de Broglie nonrelativistic causal interpretation.

title: Quantum Boolean Summation with Repetitions in the Worst-Average Setting

abstract: We study the quantum summation QS algorithm of Brassard, Hoyer, Mosca and Tapp, which approximates the arithmetic mean of a Boolean function defined on $N$ elements. We present sharp error bounds of the QS algorithm in the worst-average setting with the average performance measured in the $L_q$ norm, $q \in [1,\infty]$. We prove that the QS algorithm with $M$ quantum queries, $M<N$, has the worst-average error bounds of the form $\Theta(\ln M/M)$ for $q=1$, $\Theta(M^{-1/q})$ for $q\in (1,\infty)$, and is equal to 1 for $q=\infty$. We also discuss the asymptotic constants of these estimates. We improve the error bounds by using the QS algorithm with repetitions. Using the number of repetitions which is independent of $M$ and linearly dependent on $q$, we get the error bound of order $M^{-1}$ for any $q \in [1,\infty)$. Since $\Omega(M^{-1})$ is a lower bound on the worst-average error of any quantum algorithm with $M$ queries, the QS algorithm with repetitions is optimal in the worst-average setting.

abstract: Channel capacity describes the size of the nearly ideal channels, which can be obtained from many uses of a given channel, using an optimal error correcting code. In this paper we collect and compare minor and major variations in the mathematically precise statements of this idea which have been put forward in the literature. We show that all the variations considered lead to equivalent capacity definitions. In particular, it makes no difference whether one requires mean or maximal errors to go to zero, and it makes no difference whether errors are required to vanish for any sequence of block sizes compatible with the rate, or only for one infinite sequence.

abstract: Recently, Ambainis gave an O(N^(2/3))-query quantum walk algorithm for element distinctness, and more generally, an O(N^(L/(L+1)))-query algorithm for finding L equal numbers. We point out that this algorithm actually solves a much more general problem, the problem of finding a subset of size L that satisfies any given property. We review the algorithm and give a considerably simplified analysis of its query complexity. We present several applications, including two algorithms for the problem of finding an L-clique in an N-vertex graph. One of these algorithms uses O(N^(2L/(L+1))) edge queries, and the other uses \tilde{O}(N^((5L-2)/(2L+4))), which is an improvement for L <= 5. The latter algorithm generalizes a recent result of Magniez, Santha, and Szegedy, who considered the case L=3 (finding a triangle). We also pose two open problems regarding continuous time quantum walk and lower bounds.

abstract: Several researchers, including Leonid Levin, Gerard 't Hooft, and Stephen Wolfram, have argued that quantum mechanics will break down before the factoring of large numbers becomes possible. If this is true, then there should be a natural set of quantum states that can account for all experiments performed to date, but not for Shor's factoring algorithm. We investigate as a candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and tensor products. Using a recent lower bound on multilinear formula size due to Raz, we then show that states arising in quantum error-correction require n^{Omega(log n)} additions and tensor products even to approximate, which incidentally yields the first superpolynomial gap between general and multilinear formula size of functions. More broadly, we introduce a complexity classification of pure quantum states, and prove many basic facts about this classification. Our goal is to refine vague ideas about a breakdown of quantum mechanics into specific hypotheses that might be experimentally testable in the near future.

abstract: In this work we intend to study a class of time-dependent quantum systems with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, particularly those whose Hermitian counterpart are important for the comprehension of posed problems in quantum optics and quantum chemistry, which consists of an oscillator with time-dependent mass and frequency under the action of a time-dependent imaginary potential. The propagator for a general time-dependence of the parameters and the wave-functions are obtained explicitly for constant frequency and mass and a linear time-dependence in the potential. The wave-functions are used to obtain the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. Although it is neither Hermitian nor PT symmetric, the case under study exhibits real values of energy.

abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum teleportation of an atomic state based on the detection of cavity decay. The internal state of an atom trapped in a cavity can be disembodiedly transferred to another atom trapped in a distant cavity by measuring interference of polarized photons through single-photon detectors. In comparison with the original proposal by S. Bose, P.L. Knight, M.B. Plenio, and V. Vedral [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 5158 (1999)], our protocol of teleportation has a high fidelity of almost unity, and inherent robustness, such as the insensitivity of fidelity to randomness in the atom's position, and to detection inefficiency. All these favorable features make the scheme feasible with the current experimental technology.

In particular, we give simple and useful analytic formulas for these quantities, that can be used with arbitrary mirrors transmissions. The vacuum field in the vicinity of the center of the cavity is actually equivalent to the one obtained in a microcavity, and this scheme allows one to predict significant cavity QED effects.

The vacuum field at the center of the cavity is actually equivalent to the one obtained in a microcavity, and both the dissipative and the reactive parts of the atom's spontaneous emission are significantly modified. Using an explicit calculation of the spatial dependence of the radiative relaxation rate and of the associated level shift, we show that for a weakly excitating light field, the atom can be attracted to the center of the cavity by vacuum-induced light shifts.

abstract: Information must take up space, must weigh, and its flux must be limited. Quantum limits on communication and information storage leading to these conclusions are here described. Quantum channel capacity theory is reviewed for both steady state and burst communication. An analytic approximation is given for the maximum signal information possible with occupation number signal states as a function of mean signal energy. A theorem guaranteeing that these states are optimal for communication is proved. A heuristic "proof" of the linear bound on communication is given, followed by rigorous proofs for signals with specified mean energy, and for signals with given energy budget. And systems of many parallel quantum channels are shown to obey the linear bound for a natural channel architecture. The time--energy uncertainty principle is reformulated in information language by means of the linear bound. The quantum bound on information storage capacity of quantum mechanical and quantum field devices is reviewed. A simplified version of the analytic proof for the bound is given for the latter case. Solitons as information caches are discussed, as is information storage in one dimensional systems. The influence of signal self--gravitation on communication is considerd. Finally, it is shown that acceleration of a receiver acts to block information transfer.

abstract: This article reviews and extends recent results concerning entanglement and frustration in multipartite systems which have some symmetry with respect to the ordering of the particles. Starting point of the discussion are Bell inequalities: their relation to frustration in classical systems and their satisfaction for quantum states which have a symmetric extension. It is then discussed how more general global symmetries of multipartite systems constrain the entanglement between two neighboring particles. We prove that maximal entanglement (measured in terms of the entanglement of formation) is always attained for the ground state of a certain nearest neighbor interaction Hamiltonian having the considered symmetry with the achievable amount of entanglement being a function of the ground state energy. Systems of Gaussian states, i.e. quantum harmonic oscillators, are investigated in more detail and the results are compared to what is known about ordered qubit systems.

abstract: Quantum information storage (QIS) is a physical process to write quantum states into a quantum memory (QM). We observe that in some general cases the quantum state can be retrieved up to a unitary transformation depicted by the non-Abelian Berry's geometric phase factor (holonomy). The QIS of photon with this geometric character can be implemented with the symmetric collective excitations of a $\Lambda$-atom ensemble, which is adiabatically controlled by a classical light with a small detuning $\delta$. The cyclic change of the controlled Rabi frequency $\Omega(t)$ with period $T=\frac{2n\pi}{\delta}$ accumulates additional geometric phases in different components of the final photon state. Then, in a purely geometric way the stored state can be decoded from the final state.

abstract: The symplectic geometry of the phase space associated with a charged particle is determined by the addition of the Faraday 2-form to the standard structure on the Euclidean phase space. In this paper we describe the corresponding algebra of Weyl-symmetrized functions in coordinate and momentum operators satisfying nonlinear commutation relations. The multiplication in this algebra generates an associative product of functions on the phase space. This product is given by an integral kernel whose phase is the symplectic area of a groupoid-consistent membrane. A symplectic phase space connection with non-trivial curvature is extracted from the magnetic reflections associated with the Stratonovich quantizer. Zero and constant curvature cases are considered as examples. The quantization with both static and time dependent electromagnetic fields is obtained. The expansion of the product by the deformation parameter, written in the covariant form, is compared with the known deformation quantization formulas.

abstract: We presen a secure direct communication protocol by using step-split Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair. In this communication protocol, Alice first sends one qubit of an EPR pair to Bob. Bob sends a receipt signal to Alice through public channel when he receives Alice's first qubit. Alice performs her encoding operations on the second qubit and sends this qubit to Bob. Bob performs a Bell-basis measurement to draw Alice's information. The security of this protocol is based on `High fidelity implies low entropy'. If Eve want to eavesdrop Alice's information, she has to attack both qubits of the EPR pair, which results in that any effective eavesdropping attack can be detected. Bob's receipt signal can protect this protocol against the eavesdropping hiding in the quantum channel losses. And this protocol is strictly secure to perform a quantum key distribution by using Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes.

abstract: Quantum teleportation of a squeezed state is demonstrated experimentally. Due to some inevitable losses in experiments, a squeezed vacuum necessarily becomes a mixed state which is no longer a minimum uncertainty state. We establish an operational method of evaluation for quantum teleportation of such a state using fidelity, and discuss the classical limit for the state. The measured fidelity for the input state is 0.85$\pm$ 0.05 which is higher than the classical case of 0.73$\pm$0.04. We also verify that the teleportation process operates properly for the nonclassical state input and its squeezed variance is certainly transferred through the process. We observe the smaller variance of the teleported squeezed state than that for the vacuum state input.

abstract: We consider a collection of bosonic modes corresponding to the vertices of a graph $\Gamma.$ Quantum tunneling can occur only along the edges of $\Gamma$ and a local self-interaction term is present. Quantum entanglement of one vertex with respect the rest of the graph is analyzed in the ground-state of the system as a function of the tunneling amplitude $\tau.$ The topology of $\Gamma$ plays a major role in determining the tunneling amplitude $\tau^*$ which leads to the maximum ground-state entanglement. Whereas in most of the cases one finds the intuitively expected result $\tau^*=\infty$ we show that it there exists a family of graphs for which the optimal value of$\tau$ is pushed down to a finite value. We also show that, for complete graphs, our bi-partite entanglement provides useful insights in the analysis of the cross-over between insulating and superfluid ground states

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311060
abstract: The polynomial method and the Ambainis's lower bound (or \emph{Alb}, for short) method are two main quantum lower bound techniques. While recently Ambainis showed that the polynomial method is not tight, the present paper aims at studying the power and limitation of \emph{Alb}'s. We first use known \emph{Alb}'s to derive $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ lower bounds for \textsc{Bipartiteness}, \textsc{Bipartiteness Matching} and \textsc{Graph Matching}, in which the lower bound for \textsc{Bipartiteness} improves the previous $\Omega(n)$ one. We then show that all the three known Ambainis's lower bounds have a limitation $\sqrt{N\cdot \min\{C_0(f), C_1(f)\}}$, where $C_0(f)$ and $C_1(f)$ are the 0- and 1-certificate complexity, respectively. This implies that for some problems such as \textsc{Triangle}, $k$-\textsc{Clique}, and \textsc{Bipartite/Graph Matching} which draw wide interest and whose quantum query complexities are still open, the best known lower bounds cannot be further improved by using Ambainis's techniques. Another consequence is that all the Ambainis's lower bounds are not tight. For total functions, this upper bound for \emph{Alb}'s can be further improved to $\min \{\sqrt{C_0(f)C_1(f)}, \sqrt{N\cdot CI(f)}\}$, where $CI(f)$ is the size of max intersection of a 0-and a 1-certificate set. Again this implies that $Alb$'s cannot improve the best known lower bound for some specific problems such as \textsc{And-Or Tree}, whose precise quantum query complexity is still open. Finally, we generalize the three known \emph{Alb}'s and give a new \emph{Alb} style lower bound method, which may be easier to use for some problems.

abstract: A new approach to quantum cryptography to be called KCQ, keyed communication in quantum noise, is developed on the basis of quantum detection and communication theory for classical information transmission. By the use of a shared secret key that determines the quantum states generated for different data bit sequences, the users may employ the corresponding optimum quantum measurement to decode the data. This gives them a better error performance than an attacker who does not know the key when she makes her quantum measurement, and an overall generation of a fresh key may be obtained from the resulting advantage. This principle is illustrated in the operation of a concrete qubit system A general information-theoretic description of the overall approach will be presented, and contrasted with the detection/coding description necessary for specific protocols.

abstract: Finding systematics in the mass-lifetime data for all the hadrons has been an outstanding problem. In this work, we show that the product of mass and lifetime for unstable particles is very well-approximated by \hbar 2^n/n where n is an integer specific for a particle. In doing so, we have employed a relation between time-delay and resonances. The energy-continuum has been treated in a way to take advantage of Cantor's mathematical work on continuum. Thus, even though the resonances are designated by complex energy variables where ordering is not possible, in terms of stability, the index n labels these resonances; larger the n, more stable a resonance is.

We give examples of tripartite probability distributions from which it is impossible to extract any kind of secret key, even in the asymptotic regime, although they cannot be created by local operations and public communication. Moreover, we show that bound information can be activated: three honest parties can distill a common secret key from different distributions having bound information. Our results demonstrate that quantum information theory can provide useful insight for solving open problems in classical information theory.

We then argue that any acceptable physical theory should satisfy this independence condition.

abstract: Quantum Key Distribution with the BB84 protocol has been shown to be unconditionally secure even using weak coherent pulses instead of single-photon signals. The distances that can be covered by these methods are limited due to the loss in the quantum channel (e.g. loss in the optical fiber) and in the single-photon counters of the receivers. One can argue that the loss in the detectors cannot be changed by an eavesdropper in order to increase the covered distance. Here we show that the security analysis of this scenario is not as easy as is commonly assumed, since already two-photon processes allow eavesdropping strategies that outperform the known photon-number splitting attack. For this reason there is, so far, no satisfactory security analysis available in the framework of individual attacks.

abstract: A scheme to implement a quantum computer subjected to decoherence and governed by an untunable qubit-qubit interaction is presented. By concatenating dynamical decoupling through bang-bang (BB) pulse with decoherence-free subspaces (DFSs) encoding, we protect the quantum computer from environment-induced decoherence that results in quantum information dissipating into the environment. For the inherent qubit-qubit interaction that is untunable in the quantum system, BB control plus DFSs encoding will eliminate its undesired effect which spoils quantum information in qubits. We show how this quantum system can be used to implement universal quantum computation.

abstract: Bi-partite entanglement in multi-qubit systems cannot be shared freely. The rules of quantum mechanics impose bounds on how multi-qubit systems can be correlated. In this paper we utilize a concept of entangled graphs with weighted edges in order to analyze pure quantum states of multi-qubit systems. Here qubits are represented by vertexes of the graph while the presence of bi-partite entanglement is represented by an edge between corresponding vertexes. The weight of each edge is defined to be the entanglement between the two qubits connected by the edge, as measured by the concurrence. We prove that each entangled graph with entanglement bounded by a specific value of the concurrence can be represented by a pure multi-qubit state. In addition we present a logic network with O(N2) elementary gates that can be used for preparation of the weighted entangled graphs of N qubits.

abstract: We develop a synthesis of Turing's paradigm of computation and von Neumann's quantum logic to serve as a model for quantum computation with recursion, such that potentially non-terminating computation can take place, as in a quantum Turing machine. This model is based on the extension of von Neumann's quantum logic to partial states, defined here as sub-probability measures on the Hilbert space, equipped with the natural pointwise partial ordering. The sub-probability measures allow a certain probability for the non-termination of the computation. We then derive an extension of Gleason's theorem and show that, for Hilbert spaces of dimension greater than two, the partial order of sub-probability measures is order isomorphic with the collection of partial density operators, i.e., trace class positive operators with trace between zero and one, equipped with the usual partial ordering induced from positive operators. We show that the expected value of a bounded observable with respect to a partial state can be defined as a closed bounded interval, which extends the classical definition of expected value.

abstract: We compute the first order correction in $\hbar $ to the field dependent wave function in Statistical Field Theory. These corrections are evaluated by several usual methods. We limit ourselves to a one dimensional model in order to avoid the usual difficulties with the UV divergences that are not relevant for our purposes. The main result of the paper is that the various methods yield different corrections to the wave function. Moreover, we give arguments to show that the perturbative integration of the exact renormalization group provides the right result.

As in the classical physics no one saw action-at-a-distance, not mediated by some real communication using a carrier, people look for some mediator that makes possible an influence-passing between the distant particles. The wave function does not comprise such a kind of object. The present text tries to incorporate the mediator in the formalism of the quantum mechanics. The result is a contradiction.

abstract: Effects of classical/quantum correlations and operations in game theory are analyzed using Samaritan's Dilemma. We observe that introducing either quantum or classical correlations to the game results in the emergence of a unique or multiple Nash equilibria (NE) which do not exist in the original classical game. It is shown that the strategies creating the NE and the amount of payoffs the players receive at these NE's depend on the type of the correlation. We also discuss whether the Samaritan can resolve the dilemma acting unilaterally.

The estimated fraction of ETP among the correlated photon pairs is 37% in the present experimental setup.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311077
abstract: We study the influence of the preparation of an open quantum system on its reduced time evolution. In contrast to the frequently considered case of an initial preparation where the total density matrix factorizes into a product of a system density matrix and a bath density matrix the time evolution generally is no longer governed by a linear map nor is this map affine. Put differently, the evolution is truly nonlinear and cannot be cast into the form of a linear map plus a term that is independent of the initial density matrix of the open quantum system. As a consequence, the inhomogeneity that emerges in formally exact generalized master equations is in fact a nonlinear term that vanishes for a factorizing initial state. The general results are elucidated with the example of two interacting spins prepared at thermal equilibrium with one spin subjected to an external field. The second spin represents the environment. The field allows the preparation of mixed density matrices of the first spin that can be represented as a convex combination of two limiting pure states, i.e. the preparable reduced density matrices make up a convex set. Moreover, the map from these reduced density matrices onto the corresponding density matrices of the total system is affine only for vanishing coupling between the spins. In general, the set of the accessible total density matrices is nonconvex.

It is often not merely a transition from quantum to classical mechanics in the sense of the Correspondence Principle. The fact that real macroscopic objects like baseballs are composites of an extremely large number of microscopic particles (electrons, protons etc.) is a complicating factor. Here such composite objects are studied in some detail and the Copenhagen interpretation is applied to them. A computer game model for a simplified composite object is used to illustrate some of the issues.

abstract: Quantum correlation, or entanglement, is now believed to be an indispensable physical resource for certain tasks in quantum information processing, for which classically correlated states cannot be useful. Besides information processing, what kind of physical processes can exploit entanglement? In this paper, we show that there is indeed a more basic relationship between entanglement and its usefulness in thermodynamics. We derive an inequality showing that we can extract more work out of a heat bath via entangled systems than via classically correlated ones. We also analyze the work balance of the process as a heat engine, in connection with the Second Law of thermodynamics.

abstract: We first review the usefulness of the Wigner distribution functions (WDF), associated with Lindblad and pre-master equations, for analyzing a host of problems in Quantum Optics where dissipation plays a major role, an arena where weak coupling and long-time approximations are valid. However, we also show their limitations for the discussion of decoherence, which is generally a short-time phenomenon with decay rates typically much smaller than typical dissipative decay rates. We discuss two approaches to the problem both of which use a quantum Langevin equation (QLE) as a starting-point: (a) use of a reduced WDF but in the context of an exact master equation (b) use of a WDF for the complete system corresponding to entanglement at all times.

We also report on evidence that the ground state of an antiferromagnetic chain can be used as a perfect quantum channel if local measurements on the individual spins can be implemented.

For vector solitons, this squeezing is shown to result from an almost perfect anti-correlation between the fluctuations on the two incoherently-coupled circular polarisations.

abstract: It is shown that in the case of the one-particle one-dimensional scattering problem for a given time-independent potential, for each state of the whole quantum ensemble of identically prepared particles, there is an unique pair of (subensemble's) solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation, which, as we postulate, describe separately transmission and reflection: in the case of nonstationary states, for any instant of time, these functions are orthogonal and their sum describes the state of all particles; evolving with constant norms, one of them approaches at late times the transmitted wave packet and another approaches the reflected packet. Both for transmission and reflection, 1) well before and after the scattering event, the average kinetic energy of particles is the same, 2) the average starting point differs, in the general case, from that for all particles. It is shown that for reflection, in the case of symmetric potential barriers, the domain of the motion of particles is bounded by the midpoint of the barrier region. We define (exact and asymptotic) transmission and reflection times and show that the basic results of our formalism can be, in principle, checked experimentally.

abstract: Physical processes that could facilitate coherent control of light propagation are now actively explored. In addition to fundamental interest, these efforts are stimulated by possibilities to develop, for example, a quantum memory for photonic states. At the same time, controlled localization and storage of photonic pulses may allow novel approaches to manipulate light via enhanced nonlinear optical processes. Recently, Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) was used to reduce the group velocity of propagating light pulses and to reversibly map propagating light pulses into stationary spin excitations in atomic media. Here we describe and experimentally demonstrate a novel technique in which light propagating in a medium of Rb atoms is converted into an excitation with localized, stationary electromagnetic energy, which can be held and released after a controllable interval. Our method creates pulses of light with stationary envelopes bound to an atomic spin coherence, raising new possibilities for photon state manipulation and non-linear optical processes at low light levels.

abstract: Starting from the Lifshitz formula for the Casimir force between parallel plates we calculate the difference between the forces at two different settings, one in which the temperature is $T_1=350$ K, the other when $T_2=300$ K. As material we choose gold, and make use of the Drude dispersion relation. Our results, which are shown graphically, should be directly comparable to experiment. As an analogous calculation based upon the plasma dispersion relation leads to a different theoretical force difference, an experiment of this kind would be a decisive test. We also present an analogous calculation for the case when the two plates are replaced with a sphere-plate system, still with gold as material in both bodies. The sphere is assumed so large that the proximity theorem holds. Discussion of the consistency with the third law of thermodynamics and the validity of the surface impedance approach is provided.

abstract: This paper will address the question of the distillation of entanglement from a finite number of multi-partite mixed states. It is shown that if one can distill a pure entangled state from n copies of a mixed state $\sigma _{ABC...}$ there must be at least a subspace in whole Hilbert space of the all copies such that the projection of $\sigma_{ABC...}^{\otimes n}$ onto the subspace is a pure entangled state. We also show that the purification of entanglement or distillation of entanglement can be carried out by local joint projective measurements with the help of classical communication and local general positive operator valued measurements on a single particle, in principle. Finally we discuss experimental realizability of the entanglement purification.

The fidelity of the teleportation is reduced due to Davies-Unruh radiation in Rob's frame. In so far as teleportation is a measure of entanglement, our results suggest that quantum entanglement is degraded in non-inertial frames. We discuss this reduction in fidelity for both bosonic and fermionic resources.

abstract: The uniqueness of the Bohmian particle interpretation of the Kemmer equation, which describes massive spin-0 and spin-1 particles, is discussed. Recently the same problem for spin-1/2 was dealt with by Holland. It appears that the uniqueness of boson paths can be enforced under well determined conditions. This in turn fixes the nonrelativistic particle equations of the nonrelativistic Schrodinger equation, which appear to correspond with the original definitions given by de Broglie and Bohm only in the spin-0 case. Similar to the spin-1/2 case, there appears an additional spin-dependent term in the guidance equation in the spin-1 case. We also discuss the ambiguity associated with the introduction of an electromagnetic coupling in the Kemmer theory. We argue that when the minimal coupling is correctly introduced, then the current constructed from the energy-momentum tensor is no longer conserved. Hence this current can not serve as a particle probability four-vector.

abstract: Many quantum computation and communication schemes require, or would significantly benefit from, true sources of single photon on-demand (SPOD). Unfortunately, such sources do not exist. It is becoming increasingly clear that coupling photons out of a SPOD source will be a limiting factor in many SPOD implementations. In particular, coupling these source outputs into optical fibers (usually single mode fibers) is often the preferred method for handling this light. We investigate the practical limits to this coupling as relates to parametric downconversion, an important starting point for many SPOD schemes. We also explored whether it is possible to optimize the engineering of the downconversion sources to improve on this coupling. We present our latest results in this area.

abstract: Quantum Cryptography is on the verge of commercial application. One of its greatest limitations is over long distance - secret key rates are low and the longest fibre over which any key has been exchanged is currently 100 km. We investigate the quantum relay, which can increase the maximum distance at which quantum cryptography is possible. The relay splits the channel into sections, and sends a different photon across each section, increasing the signal to noise ratio. The photons are linked as in teleportation, with entangled photon pairs and Bell measurements. We show that such a scheme could allow cryptography over hundreds of kilometers with today's detectors. It could not, however, improve the rate of key exchange over distances where the standard single section scheme already works. We also show that reverse key reconciliation, previously used in continuous variable quantum cryptography, gives a secure key over longer distances than forward key reconciliation.

abstract: Experimental realization of quantum information processing in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been well established. Implementation of conditional phase shift gate has been a significant step, which has lead to realization of important algorithms such as Grover's search algorithm and quantum Fourier transform. This gate has so far been implemented in NMR by using coupling evolution method. We demonstrate here the implementation of the conditional phase shift gate using transition selective pulses. As an application of the gate, we demonstrate Grover's search algorithm and quantum Fourier transform by simulations and experiments using transition selective pulses.

abstract: Effects of quantum and classical correlations on game theory are studied to clarify the new aspects brought into game theory by the quantum mechanical toolbox. In this study, we compare quantum correlation represented by a maximally entangled state and classical correlation that is generated through phase damping processes on the maximally entangled state. Thus, this also sheds light on the behavior of games under the influence of noisy sources. It is observed that the quantum correlation can always resolve the dilemmas in non-zero sum games and attain the maximum sum of both players' payoffs, while the classical correlation cannot necessarily resolve the dilemmas.

abstract: For two qubits in a pure state there exists a one-to-one relation between the entanglement measure (the concurrence ${\cal C}$) and the maximal violation ${\cal M}$ of a Bell inequality. No such relation exists for the three-qubit analogue of ${\cal C}$ (the tangle $\tau$), but we have found that numerical data is consistent with a simple set of upper and lower bounds for $\tau$ given ${\cal M}$. The bounds on $\tau$ become tighter with increasing ${\cal M}$, so they are of practical use. The Svetlichny form of the Bell inequality gives tighter bounds than the Mermin form. We show that the bounds can be tightened further if the tangle is replaced by an entanglement monotone that can identify both the W state and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.

authors: Joseph M. Renes

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311106
abstract: Mutually unbiased bases have been extensively studied in the literature and are simple and effective in quantum key distribution protocols, but they are not optimal. Here equiangular spherical codes are introduced as a more efficient and robust resource for key distribution. Such codes are sets of states that are as evenly spaced throughout the vector space as possible. In the case the two parties use qubits and face the intercept/resend eavesdropping strategy, they can make use of three equally-spaced states, called a \emph{trine}, to outperform the original four-state BB84 protocol in both speed and reliability. This points toward the optimality of spherical codes in arbitrary dimensions.

abstract: We model ideal arrival-time measurements for free quantum particles and for particles subject to an external interaction by means of a narrow and weak absorbing potential. This approach is related to the operational approach of measuring the first photon emitted from a two-level atom illuminated by a laser. By operator-normalizing the resulting time-of-arrival distribution, a distribution is obtained which for freely moving particles not only recovers the axiomatically derived distribution of Kijowski for states with purely positive momenta but is also applicable to general momentum components. For particles interacting with a square barrier the mean arrival time and corresponding ``tunneling time'' obtained at the transmission side of the barrier becomes independent of the barrier width (Hartman effect) for arbitrarily wide barriers, i.e., without the transition to the ultra-opaque, classical-like regime dominated by wave packet components above the barrier.

Bohm and to consider nonlocal interactions between parts of (e.g.) a two-particle system. It is more natural to consider dependence of corresponding preparation procedures and the propagation of the initial correlations between preparation procedures. In the pilot wave formalism it is more natural to speak about correlations of the initial pilot waves which propagate with time.

abstract: It is shown how the essentials of quantum theory, i.e., the Schroedinger equation and the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, can be derived from classical physics. Next to the empirically grounded quantisation of energy and momentum, the only input is given by the assumption of fluctuations in energy and momentum to be added to the classical motion. Extending into the relativistic regime for spinless particles, this procedure leads also to a derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation. Comparing classical Hamiltonian flow with quantum theory, then, the essential difference is given by a vanishing divergence of the velocity of the probability current in the former, whereas the latter results from a much less stringent requirement, i.e., that only the average over fluctuations and positions of the average divergence be identical to zero.

abstract: Hilbert space structure is assumed as a valid geometric description for neurodynamics, i.e., for applying any kind of quantum formalism in brain dynamics. The orientation selectivity of the neurons is used as a justification to construct a type of statistical distance function which is proportional to the usual distance (or angle) between orientations of the neurons. The equivalence between the statistical distance and the Hilbert-space distance is discussed within this framework. It gives rise to the possibility of reanalysing the issue of measurement and information processing in the brain function

abstract: We present an efficient scheme for the controlled generation of pure two-qubit states possessing {\em any} desired degree of entanglement and a {\em prescribed} symmetry in two cavity QED based systems, namely, cold trapped ions and flying atoms. This is achieved via on-resonance ion/atom-cavity couplings which are time-dependent and asymmetric, leading to a trapping vacuum state condition which does not arise for identical couplings. A duality in the role of the coupling ratio yields states with a given concurrence but opposing symmetries. The experimental feasibility of the proposed scheme is also discussed.

abstract: We have integrated a commercial avalanche photodiode (APD) and the circuitry needed to operate it as a single-photon detector (SPD) onto a single PC-board. At temperatures accessible with Peltier coolers (~200-240K), the PCB-SPD achieves high detection efficiency (DE) at 1308 and 1545 nm with low dark count probability (e.g. ~10-6/bias pulse at DE=20%, 220 K), making it useful for quantum key distribution (QKD). The board generates fast bias pulses, cancels noise transients, amplifies the signals, and sends them to an on-board discriminator. A digital blanking circuit suppresses afterpulsing.

abstract: We study arrays of mechanical oscillators in the quantum domain and demonstrate how the motions of distant oscillators can be entangled without the need for control of individual oscillators and without a direct interaction between them. These oscillators are thought of as being members of an array of nano-electromechanical resonators with a voltage being applicable between neighboring resonators. Sudden non-adiabatic switching of the interaction results in a squeezing of the states of the mechanical oscillators, leading to an entanglement transport in chains of mechanical oscillators. We discuss spatial dimensions, Q-factors, temperatures and decoherence sources in some detail, and find a distinct robustness of the entanglement in the canonical coordinates in such a scheme. We also briefly discuss the challenging aspect of detection of the generated entanglement.

However, a macroscopic object generically possesses its own environment in itself, namely the complicated dynamics of internal degrees of freedom. We address a question: when and how the internal dynamics decohere interference of the center of mass motion of a macroscopic object. We will also show that weak localization of a macroscopic object in disordered potentials can be destroyed by such decoherence.

The relationship between the error rate of a physical qubit and that of a logical qubit is investigated with emphasis on determining the concatenated error correction threshold.

abstract: The Grover walk, which is related to the Grover's search algorithm on a quantum computer, is one of the typical discrete time quantum walks. However, a localization of the two-dimensional Grover walk starting from a fixed point is striking different from other types of quantum walks. The present paper explains the reason why the walker who moves according to the degree-four Grover's operator can remain at the starting point with a high probability. It is shown that the key factor for the localization is due to the degeneration of eigenvalues of the time evolution operator. In fact, the global time evolution of the quantum walk on a large lattice is mainly determined by the degree of degeneration. The dependence of the localization on the initial state is also considered by calculating the wave function analytically.

abstract: We present the results of experiments performed on cold caesium in a pulsed sinusoidal optical potential created by counter-propagating laser beams having a small frequency difference in the laboratory frame. Since the atoms, which have average velocity close to zero in the laboratory frame, have non-zero average velocity in the co-moving frame of the optical potential, we are able to centre the initial velocity distribution of the cloud at an arbitrary point in phase-space. In particular, we demonstrate the use of this technique to place the initial velocity distribution in a region of phase-space not accessible to previous experiments, namely beyond the momentum boundaries arising from the finite pulse duration of the potential. We further use the technique to explore the kicked rotor dynamics starting from a region of phase-space where there is a strong velocity dependence of the diffusion constant and quantum break time and demonstrate that this results in a marked asymmetry in the chaotic evolution of the atomic momentum distribution.

abstract: We report a single-neutron optical experiment to demonstrate the violation of a Bell-like inequality. Entanglement is achieved not between particles, but between the degrees of freedom, in this case, for a single-particle. The spin-{\small 1/2} property of neutrons are utilized. The total wave function of the neutron is described in a tensor product Hilbert space. A Bell-like inequality is derived not by a non-locality but by a contextuality. Joint measurements of the spinor and the path properties lead to the violation of a Bell-like inequality. Manipulation of the wavefunction in one Hilbert space influences the result of the measurement in the other Hilbert space. A discussion is given on the quantum contextuality and an entanglement-induced correlation in our experiment.

The requisite resources for these measurements are squeezed light beams with exotic transverse mode profiles. We show that, in principle, lossless combination of these modes can be achieved using the non-degenerate Gouy phase shift of optical resonators. When the combined squeezed beams are measured with quadrant detectors, we experimentally demonstrate a simultaneous reduction in the transverse x- and y- displacement fluctuations of 2.2 dB and 3.1 dB below the quantum noise limit.

As in a classical OPO, the signal and idler waves show large quantum correlations which can be measured experimentally due to the phase locking between the two beams. We study the influence of the waveplate on the various criteria characterizing quantum correlations. We show in particular that the quantum correlations can be maximized by using optimized quadratures.

abstract: The conventional decomposition of a vector field into longitudinal (potential) and transverse (vortex) components (Helmholtz's theorem) is claimed in [1] to be inapplicable to the time-dependent vector fields and, in particular, to the retarded solutions of Maxwell's equations. Because of this, according to [1], a number of conclusions drawn in [2] on the basis of the Helmholtz theorem turns out to be erroneous. The Helmholtz theorem is proved in this letter to hold for arbitrary vector field, both static and time-dependent. Therefore, the conclusions of the paper [2] questioned in [1] are true. The validity of Helmholtz's theorem in the general case is due to the fact that the decomposition above of vector field does not influence the field time coordinate, which plays, thus, a passive role in the decomposition procedure. An analysis is given of the mistakes made in [1]. It is noted that for point particle the longitudinal and transverse components of electric field, taken separately, are characterized by the infinitely great velocity of propagation. However, superluminal contributions to the expression for the total electric field cancel each other.

The Wigner function of the state is non negative and the average value of either polarization is nil.

abstract: It is well known that density matrices can be used in quantum mechanics to represent the information available to an observer about either a system with a random wave function (``statistical mixture'') or a system that is entangled with another system (``reduced density matrix''). We point out another role, previously unnoticed in the literature, that a density matrix can play: it can be the ``conditional density matrix,'' conditional on the configuration of the environment. A precise definition can be given in the context of Bohmian mechanics, whereas orthodox quantum mechanics is too vague to allow a sharp definition, except perhaps in special cases. In contrast to statistical and reduced density matrices, forming the conditional density matrix involves no averaging. In Bohmian mechanics with spin, the conditional density matrix replaces the notion of conditional wave function, as the object with the same dynamical significance as the wave function of a Bohmian system.

Thus the efficiency of information transmission is improved.

Although our formula involves regularization, i.e. taking a limit over many copies of the channel, it reduces to a single-letter expression in the case of generalized dephasing channels. Analogous formulae are conjectured for the simultaneous public-private capacity of a quantum channel and for the simultaneously 1-way distillable common randomness and entanglement of a bipartite quantum state.

abstract: A novel scheme for secure direct communication between Alice and Bob is proposed, where there is no need for establishing a shared secret key. The communication is based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs and teleportation between Alice and Bob. After insuring the security of the quantum channel (EPR pairs), Bob encodes the secret message directly on a sequence of particle states and transmits them to Alice by teleportation. In this scheme teleportation transmits Bob's message without revealing any information to a potential eavesdropper. Alice can read out the encoded messages directly by the measurement on her qubits. Because there is not a transmission of the qubit which carry the secret message between Alice and Bob, it is completely secure for direct secret communication if perfect quantum channel is used.

abstract: Without additional resources, it is often impossible to transform one entangled quantum state into another with local quantum operations and classical communication. Jonathan and Plenio [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 3566(1999)] presented an interesting example showing that the presence of another state, called a catalyst, enables such a transformation without changing the catalyst. They also pointed out that in general it is very hard to find an analytical condition under which a catalyst exists. In this paper we study the existence of catalysts for two incomparable quantum states. For the simplest case of $2\times 2$ catalysts for transformations from one $4\times 4$ state to another, a necessary and sufficient condition for existence is found. For the general case, we give an efficient polynomial time algorithm to decide whether a $k\times k$ catalyst exists for two $n\times n$ incomparable states, where $k$ is treated as a constant.

The algorithm uses two quantum registers and two Fourier transforms whereas Shor's algorithm requires three registers and four Fourier transforms. A crucial ingredient of the algorithm is a quantum state that needs to be constructed before we can perform the computation. After one copy of this state is created, the algorithm can be executed arbitrarily many times.

abstract: We quantify the entanglement generated between an atom and a laser pulse in free space. We find that the entanglement calculated using a simple closed-system Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is in remarkable agreement with a full open-system calculation, even though the free-space geometry is far from the strong coupling regime of cavity QED. We explain this result using a simple model in which the atom couples weakly to the laser while coupling strongly to the vacuum. Additionally we place an upper bound on the total entanglement between the atom and all paraxial modes using a quantum trajectories unravelling. This upper bound provides a benchmark for atom-laser coupling.

abstract: In this paper we introduce a quantum information theoretical model for quantum secret sharing schemes. We show that quantum information theory provides a unifying framework for the study of these schemes. We prove that the information theoretical requirements for a class of quantum secret sharing schemes reduce to only one requirement (the recoverability condition) as a consequence of the no-cloning principle. We give also a shorter proof of the fact that the size of the shares in a quantum secret sharing scheme must be at least as large as the secret itself.

We consider a collection of three-level atoms in $\Lambda$ configuration simultaneously interacting with a resonant two-mode cavity for this purpose. Our approach permits a variety of multiparticle extensions.

abstract: We describe the use of optically levitated microspheres as test masses in experiments aimed at reaching and potentially exceeding the standard quantum limit for position measurements. Optically levitated microspheres have low mass and are essentially free of suspension thermal noise, making them well suited for reaching the quantum regime. Table-top experiments using microspheres can bridge the gap between quantum-limited position measurements of single atoms and measurements with multi-kg test masses like those being used in interferometric gravitational wave detectors.

abstract: A huge family of solvable potentials can be generated by systematically exploiting the factorization (Darboux) method. Starting from the free case, a large class of the known solvable families is thus reproduced, together with new ones. We explicitly find and solve several new singular potentials obtained by iteration from the V=0 case; some of them have an E=0 bound state and constant phase shift without being explicitly scale invariant. The new potentials are rational functions, and can be related to rational solutions of the KdV family.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311140
abstract: This report presents an approach to the exact solutions of the time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model without the rotating wave approximation (RWA). It is shown that there is a squeezing-operator unitary transformation for relating the J-C model without RWA and the one with RWA. Thus by using an appropriate squeezing unitary transformation, the time-dependent J-C model without RWA can be transformed into the one with RWA that has been exactly solved previously, and based on this one can readily obtain the exact solutions of the time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (J-C) model without RWA. The approach presented here also shows that we can treat these two kinds of time-dependent J-C models (both with and without RWA) in a unified way.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311142
abstract: Nielsen [quant-ph/0108020] introduced a model of quantum computation by measurement-based simulation of unitary computations. In this model, a consequence of the non-determinism of quantum measurement is the probabilistic termination of simulations. This means that the time when simulation terminates for a given computation is probabilistic, and this simulation may even never end. We introduce (section 3) a measurement-based model with non probabilistic termination, which permits, unlike existing models, to predict the time of termination. This new scheme is a modification of Nielsen's. After an introduction to Nielsen's scheme (section 1), an analysis of different temporal organisations of elementary simulations within Nielsen's scheme (section 2) leads to the non probabilistic model.

abstract: We present a way to apply quantum logic to the study of quantum programs. This is made possible by using an extension of the usual propositional language in order to make transformations performed on the system appear explicitly. This way, the evolution of the system becomes part of the logical study. We show how both unitary operations and two-valued measurements can be included in this formalism and can thus be handled logically.

Lett.,vol. 73, 2279 (1994)]. A double heterodyne measurement is used to measure correlations in the Fock space spanned by zero and one photons. Local oscillators used in the correlation measurement are distributed to two observers by co-propagating it in an orthogonal polarization mode. This method eliminates the need for interferometrical stability in the setup, consequently making it a robust and scalable method.

abstract: It is shown that Schrodinger dynamics can be embedded in a larger dynamical theory which extends its symmetry group from the unitary group to the full metaplectic group, i.e. the group of linear canonical transformations. Among the newly admitted non-unitary processes are analogues of the classical measurement process which makes it possible to treat the wave-function as an objective property of the quantum mechanical system on the same footing as the phase-space coordinates of a classical system. The notion of "observables" that in general have values only when measured can then be dispensed with, and the measurement paradox disappears.

abstract: We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that a coherent image of a pure phase object may be obtained by use of a spatially incoherent illumination beam. This is accomplished by employing a two-beam source of entangled photons generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Though each of the beams is, in and of itself, spatially incoherent, the pair of beams exhibits higher-order inter-beam coherence. One of the beams probes the phase object while the other is scanned. The image is recorded by measuring the photon coincidence rate using a photon-counting detector in each beam. Using a reflection configuration, we successfully imaged a phase object implemented by a MEMS micro-mirror array. The experimental results are in accord with theoretical predictions.

abstract: Quantum algorithms and complexity have recently been studied not only for discrete, but also for some numerical problems. Most attention has been paid so far to the integration problem, for which a speed-up is shown by quantum computers with respect to deterministic and randomized algorithms on a classical computer. In this paper we deal with the randomized and quantum complexity of initial-value problems. For this nonlinear problem, we show that both randomized and quantum algorithms yield a speed-up over deterministic algorithms. Upper bounds on the complexity in the randomized and quantum settings are shown by constructing algorithms with a suitable cost, where the construction is based on integral information. Lower bounds result from the respective bounds for the integration problem.

abstract: If the density matrix is treated as an objective description of individual systems, it may become possible to attribute the same objective significance to statistical mechanical properties, such as entropy or temperature, as to properties such as mass or energy. It is shown that the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum theory can be consistently applied to density matrices as a description of individual systems. The resultant trajectories are examined for the case of the delayed choice interferometer, for which Bell appears to suggest that such an interpretation is not possible. Bell's argument is shown to be based upon a different understanding of the density matrix to that proposed here.

abstract: We consider an atomic beam reservoir as a source of quantum noise. The atoms are modelled as two-state systems and interact one-at-a-time with the system. The Floquet operators are described in terms of the Fermionic creation, annihilation and number operators associated with the two-state atom. In the limit where the time between interactions goes to zero and the interaction is suitably scaled, we show that we may obtain a causal (that is, adapted) quantum stochastic differential equation of Hudson-Parthasarathy type, driven by creation, annihilation and conservation processes. The effect of the Floquet operators in the continuous limit is exactly captured by the Holevo ordered form for the stochastic evolution.

We illustrate this approach using the examples of displaced number states and two photon coherent states and show it to provide an efficient method for computing and interpreting the photon number distribution . This result is interesting in particular for the two photon coherent states which, for high squeezing, have the probabilities of even and odd photon numbers oscillating independently.

It is numerically demonstrated that the probability error is proportional to $\epsilon^4$, while the phase error is proportional to $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the characteristic deviation from the perfect pulse duration.

authors: Adrian Faigon
comments: Version 3. The whole article rewritten. Main content change is in Sections II.A to II.D: The main idea --the CPDQ principle for observables-- is obtained from an explicited property of the Lagrangian function.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311153
abstract: Mechanics can be founded on a principle relating the uncertainty delta-q in the trajectory of an observable particle to its motion relative to the observer. From this principle, p.delta-q=const., p being the q-conjugated momentum, mechanical laws are derived and the meaning of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions are discussed. The connection between the presented principle and Hamilton's Least Action Principle is examined. Wave mechanics and Schrodinger equation appear without additional assumptions by choosing the representation for delta-q in the case the motion is not trajectory describable. The Cramer-Rao inequality serves that purpose. For a particle hidden from direct observation, the position uncertainty determined by the enclosing boundaries leads to thermodynamics in a straightforward extension of the presented formalism. The introduction of uncertainty in classical mechanics formulation enables the translation of mechanical laws into the wide ranging conceptual framework of information theory. The boundaries between classical mechanics, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are defined in terms of informational changes associated with the system evolution. As a direct application of the proposed formulation upper bounds for the rate of information transfer are derived.

abstract: Nonlocality without entanglement is an interesting field. A manifestation of quantum nonlocality without entanglement is the local indistinguishability of a set of orthogonal product states. In this paper we analyze the character of operators to distinguish a set of full product bases in a multi-partite system, and show that distinguishing perfectly a set of full product bases needs only local projective measurements and classical communication, and these measurements cannot damage each product basis. Employing these conclusions one can discuss local distinguishability of full product bases easily. Finally we discuss the generalization of these results to the locally distinguishability of a set of incomplete product bases.

abstract: The two main features of the Aharonov-Bohm effect are the topological dependence of accumulated phase on the winding number around the magnetic fluxon, and non-locality -- local observations at any intermediate point along the trajectories are not affected by the fluxon. The latter property is usually regarded as exclusive to quantum mechanics. Here we show that both the topological and non-local features of the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be manifested in a classical model that incorporates random noise. The model also suggests new types of multi-particle topological non-local effects which have no quantum analog.

abstract: A scheme is proposed here to achieve swapping and entangling of photonic and atomic qubits with high fidelity. The mechanism is based on the scattering of a single photon from a $\Lambda$-type three-level atom. The evolution of the coupled system is analyzed by projecting the quantum state onto a `bright' and a `dark' state. Quantum interference of these two states, which is determined by a frequency-dependent phase angle, can be exploited to perform various two-qubit transformations. It is remarkable that the probability of success of such transformations can approach unity in the strong coupling cavity QED regime.

authors: Tien D. Kieu
comments: Now 18 pages, 8 figures

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311157
abstract: We introduce a class of quantum heat engines which consists of two-energy-eigenstate systems, the simplest of quantum mechanical systems, undergoing quantum adiabatic processes and energy exchanges with heat baths, respectively, at different stages of a cycle. Armed with this class of heat engines and some interpretation of heat transferred and work performed at the quantum level, we are able to clarify some important aspects of the second law of thermodynamics. In particular, it is not sufficient to have the heat source hotter than the sink, but there must be a minimum temperature difference between the hotter source and the cooler sink before any work can be extracted through the engines. The size of this minimum temperature difference is dictated by that of the energy gaps of the quantum engines involved. Our new quantum heat engines also offer a practical way, as an alternative to Szilard's engine, to physically realise Maxwell's daemon. Inspired and motivated by the Rabi oscillations, we further introduce some modifications to the quantum heat engines with single-mode cavities in order to, while respecting the second law, extract more work from the heat baths than is otherwise possible in thermal equilibria. Some of the results above are also generalisable to quantum heat engines of an infinite number of energy levels including 1-D simple harmonic oscillators and 1-D infinite square wells.

In particular, I discuss our contrasting opinions about the nature and randomness of quantum events, about relativity theory, and about the many-minds idea. I also suggest that Stapp's theories are inadequately developed.

The procedure is distinct from the standard Einstein two-way clock synchronization method in that photon correlations are used to define simultaneous events in the frame of reference of a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer. Once the HOM interferometer is balanced, by use of an adjustable optical delay in one arm, arrival times of simultaneously generated photons are recorded by each clock. Classical information on the arrival times is sent from one clock to the other, and a correlation of arrival times is done to determine the clock offset.

During the passage, the atomic wave packets in two distinct internal states trace out split trajectories, guided by the optical beams, with the amplitude and spread of each wave-packet varying continuously, producing fringes that can reach a visibility close to unity. We show that the rotation sensitivity of this continuous interferometer (CI) can be comparable to that of the Borde-Chu Interferometer (BCI). The relative simplicity of the CI makes it a potentially better candidate for practical applications.

abstract: Quantum protocols for coin-flipping can be composed in series in such a way that a cheating party gains no extra advantage from using entanglement between different rounds. This composition principle applies to coin-flipping protocols with cheat sensitivity as well, and is used to derive two results: There are no quantum strong coin-flipping protocols with cheat sensitivity that is linear in the bias (or bit-commitment protocols with linear cheat detection) because these can be composed to produce strong coin-flipping with arbitrarily small bias. On the other hand, it appears that quadratic cheat detection cannot be composed in series to obtain even weak coin-flipping with arbitrarily small bias.

It is proposed to use the norm of each subvector as the contribution of the corresponding pair in entanglement of the system.

abstract: The sensitivity in interferometric measurements such as gravitational-wave detectors is ultimately limited by quantum noise of light. We discuss the use of feedback mechanisms to reduce the quantum effects of radiation pressure. Recent experiments have shown that it is possible to reduce the thermal motion of a mirror by cold damping. The mirror motion is measured with an optomechanical sensor based on a high-finesse cavity, and reduced by a feedback loop. We show that this technique can be extended to lock the mirror at the quantum level. In gravitational-waves interferometers with Fabry-Perot cavities in each arms, it is even possible to use a single feedback mechanism to lock one cavity mirror on the other. This quantum locking greatly improves the sensitivity of the interferometric measurement. It is furthermore insensitive to imperfections such as losses in the interferometer.

abstract: We present a quantum communication protocol which keeps all the properties of the ping-pong protocol [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 187902 (2002)] but improves the capacity doubly as the ping-pong protocol. Alice and Bob can use the variable measurement basises in control mode to detect Eve's eavesdropping attack. In message mode, Alice can use one unitary operations to encode two bits information. Bob only needs to perform a Bell type measurement to decode Alice's information. A classical message authentification method can protect this protocol against the eavesdropping hiding in the quantum channel losses and the denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The reciprocal Schr\"{o}dinger equation $\partial S(\omega ,{\bf r}% )/i\partial \omega =\hat{\tau}(\omega ,{\bf r}) S(\omega ,{\bf r})$ for $S$-matrix with temporal operator instead the Hamiltonian is established via the Legendre transformation of classical action function. Corresponding temporal functions are expressed via propagators of interacting fields. Their real parts $\tau_{1}$are equivalent to the Wigner-Smith delay durations at process of scattering and imaginary parts $\tau_{2}$ express the duration of final states formation (dressing). As an apparent example, they can be clearly interpreted in the oscillator model via polarization ($% \tau_{1}$) and conductivity ($\tau_{2}$) of medium. The $\tau $-functions are interconnected by the dispersion relations of Kramers-Kr\"{o}nig type. From them follows, in particular, that $\tau_{2}$ is twice bigger than the uncertainty value and thereby is measurable; it must be negative at some tunnel transitions and thus can explain the observed superluminal transfer of excitations at near field intervals (M.E.Perel'man. In: arXiv. physics/0309123). The covariant generalizations of reciprocal equation clarifies the adiabatic hypothesis of scattering theory as the requirement: $% \tau_{2}\to 0$ at infinity future and elucidate the physical sense of some renormalization procedures.

abstract: We present a systematic analysis how one can improve performance of probabilistic programmable quantum processors. We generalize a simple Vidal-Masanes-Cirac processor that realizes U(1) rotations on a qubit with the phase of the rotation encoded in a state of the program register. We show how the probability of success of the probabilistic processor can be enhanced by using the processor in loops. In addition we show that the same strategy can be utilized for a probabilistic implementation of non-unitary transformations on qubits. In addtion, we show that an arbitrary SU(2) transformations of qubits can be encoded in program state of a universal programmable probabilistic quantum processor. The probability of success of this processor can be enhanced by a systematic correction of errors via conditional loops. Finally, we show that all our results can be generalized also for qudits. In particular, we show how to implement SU (N) rotations of qudits via programmable quantum processor and how the performance of the processor can be enhanced when it is used in loops.

This universal quantum machine allows us to perform a generalized measurement on the initial state of the input qudit to construct a Husimi function of this state. The trade-off between the gain and the disturbance of the qudit is controlled by the initial state of ancillary system that acts as a program register for the quantum-information distributor. The trade-off fidelity does not depend on the initial state of the qudit.

We demonstrate guiding of thermal atoms around more than two complete turns along a spiral shaped 25mm long curved path (curve radii down to 200$\mu$m) at various atom--surface distances (35-450$\mu$m). An extension of the scheme for the guiding of Bose-Einstein condensates is outlined.

abstract: Transient {\it time-domain resonances} found recently in time-dependent solutions to Schr\"{o}dinger's equation are used to investigate the issue of the tunneling time in rectangular potential barriers. In general, a time frequency analysis shows that these transients have frequencies above the cutoff frequency associated with the barrier height, and hence correspond to non-tunneling processes. We find, however, a regime characterized by the barrier opacity, where the peak maximum $t_{max}$ of the {\it time-domain resonance} corresponds to under-the-barrier tunneling. We argue that $t_{max}$ represents the relevant tunneling time scale through the classically forbidden region.

abstract: We consider finite macroscopic systems, i.e., systems of large but finite degrees of freedom, which we believe are poorly understood as compared with small systems and infinite systems. We focus on pure states that do not have the `cluster property.' Such a pure state is entangled macroscopically, and is quite anomalous in view of many-body physics because it does not approach any pure state in the infinite-size limit. However, we often encounter such anomalous states when studying finite macroscopic systems, such as quantum computers with many qubits and finite systems that will exhibit symmetry breaking in the infinite-size limit. We study stabilities of such anomalous states in general systems. In contrast to the previous works, we obtain general and universal results, by making full use of the locality of the theory. Using the general results, we discuss roles of anomalous states in quantum computers, and the mechanism of emergence of a classical world from quantum theory.

We discuss bifurcations of pure stationary states for open quantum systems which are quantum analogs of classical dynamical bifurcations.

The qubits are stored in electronic spin degrees of freedom of the doped atom $N$ or $P$. By means of the magnetic dipolar coupling between two neighboring fullerenes, the two-qubit controlled-NOT gate and the two-qubit conditional phase gate are performed by selective microwave pulses assisted by refocusing technique. We will discuss the necessary additional steps for the universality of our proposal. We will also show that our proposal is useful for both quantum gating and the readout of quantum information from the spin-based qubit state.

This includes a variety of conventional double-slit experiments, but also particle oscillations, as in the case of the neutral-kaon system, and Mott scattering of identical nuclei. For all these cases, a unified description can be achieved including a new parameter, $\nu$, which quantifies the effective number of fringes one can observe in each specific interferometric set-up.

Specifically we investigate quantitative relations between the concurrence and linear entropy for a two-qubit mixed system, implemented as two two-level atoms interacting with a single-mode cavity field. The dynamical evolutions of the entanglement and entropy, are controlled via time-dependent cavity-atom couplings. Our theoretical findings lead us to propose an alternative measure of entanglement, which could be used to develop a much needed correlation measure for more general multi-partite quantum systems.

The idea is to apply a unitary transformation such that the exact transformed Hamiltonian has one of the three levels decoupled for all values of the detunings. When one takes into account damping, the evolution of the system is governed by a master equation usually obtained via adiabatic approximation under the assumption of far-detuned lasers. To go around the drawbacks of this technique, we use the same unitary transformation to get an effective master equation.

The method can be used for solving the separability problem in an experimental setting as well as in the purely mathematical setting. The idea is to invoke the following characterization of entangled states: A state is entangled if and only if there exists an entanglement witness that detects it. The method is basically a search for an entanglement witness that detects the given state.

We obtain an analytical expression for the entanglement of formation for this system in terms of the parameters of the Hamiltonian and T. We show that depending on the relation among the coupling constants it is possible to increase the amount of entanglement of the system increasing its anisotropy. We also show numerically that for all sets of the coupling constants entanglement is a monotonically decreasing function of the temperature T, proving that we must have at least an external magnetic field in the z-direction to obtain a behavior where entanglement increases with T.

From which we try to provide a new gateway for the conundrum of time in quantum mechanics and reconstruct a unified foundation for some issues of time.

abstract: We prove a very general lower bound technique for quantum and randomized query complexity, that is easy to prove as well as to apply. To achieve this, we introduce the use of Kolmogorov complexity to query complexity. Our technique generalizes the weighted, unweighted methods of Ambainis, and the spectral method of Barnum, Saks and Szegedy. As an immediate consequence of our main theorem, adversary methods can only prove lower bounds for boolean functions $f$ in $O(\min(\sqrt{n C_0(f)},\sqrt{n C_1(f)}))$, where $C_0, C_1$ is the certificate complexity, and $n$ is the size of the input. We also derive a general form of the ad hoc weighted method used by Hoyer, Neerbek and Shi to give a quantum lower bound on ordered search and sorting.

abstract: The predictions for the shell structure of metal clusters of the three-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator (3D q-HO), utilizing techniques of quantum groups and having the symmetry Uq(3)$\supset$SOq(3), are compared to the restrictions imposed by the periodic orbit theory of Balian and Bloch, of electrons moving in a spherical cavity. It is shown that agreement between the predictions of the two models is established through the introduction of an additional term to the Hamiltonian of the 3D q-HO, which does not influence the predictions for supershells. This term preserves the Uq(3)$\supset$SOq(3) symmetry, while in addition it can be derived through a variational procedure, analogous to the one leading from the usual harmonic oscillator to the Morse oscillator by introducing the concept of the Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO).

abstract: Measurement interaction between a measured object and a measuring instrument, if both are initially in a pure state, produces a (final) bipartite entangled state vector. The quasi-classical part of the correlations in it is connected with transmission of information in the measurement. But, prior to "reading" the instrument, there is also purely quantum entanglement in the final state vector. It is shown that in repeatable measurement quantitatively the entanglement equals the amount of incompatibility between the measured observable and the final state. It also equals the amount of incompatibility of the observable and the initial state of the object.

abstract: We address the question as to whether an entangled state that satisfies local realism will give a violation of the same, after entanglement swapping in a suitable scenario. We consider such possibility as a kind of superadditivity in nonclassicality. Importantly, it will indicate that checking for violation of local realism, in the state obtained after entanglement swapping, can be a method for detecting entanglement in the input state of the swapping procedure. We investigate various entanglement swapping schemes, which involve mixed initial states. The strength of violation of local realism by the state obtained after entanglement swapping, is compared with the one for the input states. We obtain a kind of superadditivity of violation of local realism for Werner states, consequent upon entanglement swapping involving Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state measurements. We also discuss whether entanglement swapping of specific states may be used in quantum repeaters with a substantially reduced need to perform the entanglement distillation step.

abstract: The dynamical properties of a quantum system can be profoundly influenced by its environment. Usually, the environment provokes decoherence and its action on the system can often be schematized by adding a noise term in the Hamiltonian. However, other scenarios are possible: we show that by increasing the strength of the noise, the Hilbert space of the system gradually splits into invariant subspaces, among which transitions become increasingly difficult. The phenomenon is equivalent to the formation of the quantum Zeno subspaces. We explore the possibility that noise can {\em prevent}, rather than provoke decoherence.

Deterministic programmable quantum gate arrays are considered as an example. They are also called von Neumann quantum processors here and use conditional quantum dynamics. Such devices have some problems with universality, but consideration of hybrid quantum processors, i.e., models with both continuous and discrete quantum variables resolves the problems. It is also discussed comparison of such a model of quantum processors with more traditional approach.

abstract: We report the coherent manipulation of internal states of neutral atoms in a magnetic microchip trap. Coherence lifetimes exceeding 1 s are observed with atoms at distances of $5-130 \mu$m from the microchip surface. The coherence lifetime in the chip trap is independent of atom-surface distance within our measurement accuracy, and agrees well with the results of similar measurements in macroscopic magnetic traps. Due to the absence of surface-induced decoherence, a miniaturized atomic clock with a relative stability in the $10^{-13}$ range can be realized. For applications in quantum information processing, we propose to use microwave near-fields in the proximity of chip wires to create potentials that depend on the internal state of the atoms.

It is thus possible to generate highly non-classical n-photon polarization states using only the bunching effects associated with the bosonic nature of photons. The effects of mode-matching errors are discussed and the possibility of creating n-photon entanglement by redistributing the photons into n separate modes is considered.

abstract: We consider critical models in one dimension. We study the ground state in thermodynamic limit [infinite lattice]. Following Bennett, Bernstein, Popescu, and Schumacher, we use the entropy of a sub-system as a measure of entanglement. We calculate the entropy of a part of the ground state. At zero temperature it describes entanglement of this part with the rest of the ground state. We obtain an explicit formula for the entropy of the subsystem at low temperature. At zero temperature we reproduce a logarithmic formula of Holzhey, Larsen and Wilczek. Our derivation is based on the second law of thermodynamics. The entropy of a subsystem is calculated explicitly for Bose gas with delta interaction, the Hubbard model and spin chains with arbitrary value of spin.

abstract: We investigate the emission of multimodal polarized light from Light Emitting Devices due to spin-aligned carriers injection. The results are derived through operator Langevin equations, which include thermal and carrier-injection fluctuations, as well as non-radiative recombination and electronic g-factor temperature dependence. We study the dynamics of the optoelectronic processes and show how the temperature-dependent g-factor and magnetic field affect the polarization degree of the emitted light. In addition, at high temperatures, thermal fluctuation reduces the efficiency of the optoelectronic detection method for measuring spin-polarization degree of carrier injection into non-magnetic semicondutors.

abstract: In a previous paper we proposed a model to describe a gas of pyramidal molecules interacting via dipole-dipole interactions. The interaction modifies the tunneling properties between the classical equilibrium configurations of the single molecule and, for sufficiently high pressure, the molecules become localized in these classical configurations. The model explains quantitatively the shift to zero-frequency of the inversion line observed upon increase of the pressure in a gas of ammonia or deuterated ammonia. Here we analyze further the model especially with respect to stability questions.

abstract: We consider atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures in optical lattices and study the superfluidity of fermionic atoms due to s-wave pairing induced by boson-fermion interactions. We prove that the induced fermion-fermion coupling is always {\it attractive} if the boson-boson on site interaction is repulsive, and predict the existence of an enhanced BEC--BCS crossover as the strength of the lattice potential is varied. We show that for direct on-site fermion-fermion {\it repulsion}, the induced attraction can give rise to superfluidity via s-wave pairing, at striking variance with the case of pure systems of fermionic atoms with direct repulsive interactions.

abstract: The reflection matrix R=S^{\dagger}S, with S being the scattering matrix, differs from the unit one, when absorption is finite. Using the random matrix approach, we calculate analytically the distribution function of its eigenvalues in the limit of a large number of propagating modes in the leads attached to a chaotic cavity. The obtained result is independent on the presence of time-reversal symmetry in the system, being valid at finite absorption and arbitrary openness of the system. The particular cases of perfectly and weakly open cavities are considered in detail. An application of our results to the problem of thermal emission from random media is briefly discussed.

abstract: A dipolar gate alternative to the exchange gate based Kane quantum computer is proposed where the qubits are electron spins of shallow group V donors in silicon. Residual exchange coupling is treated as gate error amenable to quantum error correction, removing the stringent requirements on donor positioning characteristic of all silicon exchange-based implementations [B. Koiller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 027903 (2002)]. Contrary to common speculation, such a scheme is scalable with no overhead in gating time even though it is based on long-range dipolar inter-qubit coupling.

abstract: We study the spin states of a few-electron quantum dot defined in a two-dimensional electron gas, by applying a large in-plane magnetic field. We observe the Zeeman splitting of the two-electron spin triplet states. Also, the one-electron Zeeman splitting is clearly resolved at both the zero-to-one and the one-to-two electron transition. Since the spin of the electrons transmitted through the dot is opposite at these two transitions, this device can be employed as an electrically tunable, bipolar spin filter. Calculations and measurements show that higher-order tunnel processes and spin-orbit interaction have a negligible effect on the polarization.

abstract: We study the time dependent electron-electron and electron-hole correlations in a mesoscopic device which is splitting an incident current of free fermions into two spatially separated particle streams. We analyze the appearance of entanglement as manifested in a Bell inequality test and discuss its origin in terms of local spin-singlet correlations already present in the initial channel and the action of post-selection during the Bell type measurement. The time window over which the Bell inequality is violated is determined in the tunneling limit and for the general situation with arbitrary transparencies. We compare our results with alternative Bell inequality tests based on coincidence probabilities.

abstract: Casimir interactions between macroscopic objects are strongly influenced by their geometrical features as shape and orientation as well as by their material properties. The effect of geometry is commonly obtained from the proximity approximation (PA). Here we present a path integral quantization for the electromagnetic field in the presence of deformed metallic surfaces. From the resulting effective action the Casimir force between the surfaces can be calculated without the PA. For corrugated surfaces the force is obtained both perturbatively for small deformations and by a numerical approach for general deformation amplitudes. For general dielectric materials with flat surfaces a path integral based derivation of the Lifshitz theory is outlined, pointing towards a possible approach to study the combined effect of deformations and material properties.

abstract: The unknown state $\hrho$ of a quantum system S is determined by letting it interact with an auxiliary system A, the initial state of which is known. A one-to-one mapping can thus be realized between the density matrix $\hrho$ and the probabilities of occurrence of the eigenvalues of a single and factorized observable of S+A, so that $\hrho$ can be determined by repeated measurements using a single apparatus. If S and A are spins, it suffices to measure simultaneously their $z$-components after a controlled interaction. The most robust setups are determined in this case, for an initially pure or a completely disordered state of A. They involve an Ising or anisotropic Heisenberg coupling and an external field.

We performed spectroscopy of a flux qubit and we measured relaxation times of the order of 80 $\mu s$.

abstract: Small quantum systems non-weakly coupled to a bath become in the quantum regime surrounded by a cloud of photons or phonons, which modifies their thermodynamic behavior. Exactly solvable examples are the Brownian motion of a quantum particle in a harmonic confining potential and coupled to a harmonic quantum thermal bath, e.g. an ion in a Penning trap, and a spin immersed in a bosonic bath, as occurs in NMR physics. It appears that the Clausius inequality $\dbarrm Q\le T\d S$ can be violated. For non-adiabatic changes of system parameters the rate of energy dissipation can be negative, and, out of equilibrium, cyclic processes are possible which extract work from the bath. Experimental setups for testing some of the effects are discussed.

abstract: This paper deals with the conversion between atoms and molecules in optical lattices. We show that in the absence of collisional interaction, the atomic and molecular components in different lattice wells combine into states with macroscopic condensate fractions, which can be observed as a strong diffraction signal, if the particles are abruptly released from the lattice. The condensate population, and the diffraction signal are governed not only by the mean number of atoms or molecules in each well, but by the precise amplitudes on state vector components with different numbers of particles. We discuss ways to control these amplitudes and to maximize the condensate fraction in the molecular formation process.

Comparisons made with recent qubit experiments show this type of measurement provides another method to quantify entanglement with the environment.

abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of the appearance of entanglement in non-interacting mesoscopic structures. Our setup involves two oppositely polarized sources injecting electrons of opposite spin into the two incoming leads. The mixing of these polarized streams in an ideal four-channel beam splitter produces two outgoing streams with particular tunable correlations. A Bell inequality test involving cross-correlated spin-currents in opposite leads signals the presence of spin-entanglement between particles propagating in different leads. We identify the role of fermionic statistics and projective measurement in the generation of these spin-entangled electrons.

abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation has been extremely successful in the theory of weakly-interacting Bose-Einstein condensates. However, present-day experiments reach beyond the regime of its validity due to the significant role of correlations. We review a method of tackling the dynamics of correlations in Bose condensed gases, in terms of noncommutative cumulants. This new approach has a wide range of applicability in the areas of current interest, e.g. the production of molecules and the manipulation of interactions in condensates. It also offers an interesting perspective on the classical-field methods for partly condensed Bose gases.

abstract: In the m-out-of-n oblivious transfer (OT) model, one party Alice sends n bits to another party Bob, Bob can get only m bits from the n bits. However, Alice cannot know which m bits Bob received. Y.Mu[MJV02]} and Naor[Naor01] presented classical m-out-of-n oblivious transfer based on discrete logarithm. As the work of Shor [Shor94], the discrete logarithm can be solved in polynomial time by quantum computers, so such OTs are unsafe to the quantum computer. In this paper, we construct a quantum m-out-of-n OT (QOT) scheme based on the transmission of polarized light and show that the scheme is robust to general attacks, i.e. the QOT scheme satisfies statistical correctness and statistical privacy.

abstract: We provide a mechanism by which, from a background independent model with no quantum mechanics, quantum theory arises in the same limit in which spatial properties appear. Starting with an arbitrary abstract graph as the microscopic model of spacetime, our ansatz is that the microscopic dynamics can be chosen so that 1) the model has a low low energy limit which reproduces the non-relativistic classical dynamics of a system of N particles in flat spacetime, 2) there is a minimum length, and 3) some of the particles are in a thermal bath or otherwise evolve stochastically. We then construct simple functions of the degrees of freedom of the theory and show that their probability distributions evolve according to the Schroedinger equation. The non-local hidden variables required to satisfy the conditions of Bell's theorem are the links in the fundamental graph that connect nodes adjacent in the graph but distant in the approximate metric of the low energy limit. In the presence of these links, distant stochastic fluctuations are transferred into universal quantum fluctuations.

We quantise in the spirit of the Dirac scheme for constrained systems.

abstract: The aim of this contribution is to illustrate two basic aspects of quantum mechanics applied to the neutral kaon system. We first describe a recent quantitative formulation of Bohr's complementarity principle for free--space evolution of single kaons and entangled kaon pairs. We then show that the neutral kaon system is also suitable for an optimal demonstration of the ``quantum eraser'', including its operation in the ``delayed choice'' mode. In our discussions, strangeness oscillations play the role of the traditional interference pattern linked to wave--like behaviour. The role of the two interferometric paths taken by particle--like objects is played by the differently propagating $K_S$ and $K_L$ components. Their distinct decay widths provide a quantum ``mark'' which can be erased by appropriate strangeness measurements.

The role of these assumptions is analyzed. The Euler-Lagrange equations in momentum picture are derived and attention is paid on the conserved operators in it.

abstract: We develop a general formalism for covariant Hamiltonian evolution of supersymmetric (field) theories by making use of the fact that these can be represented on the exterior bundle over their bosonic configuration space as generalized Dirac-Kaehler systems of the form $(d \pm d^\dag)\ket{\psi} = 0$. By using suitable deformations of the supersymmetry generators we find covariant Hamiltonians for target spaces with general gravitational and Kalb-Ramond field backgrounds and discuss their perturbation theory. As an example, these results are applied to the study of curvature corrections of superstring spectra for $AdS_3 x S^3$ close to its pp-wave limit.

Therefore there is an inconsistency in Dirac theory involving the evaluation of the Schwinger term. This inconsistency is discussed along with a possible way to resolve it.

The generalized Dirac oscillator already analyzed in a previous work is obtained as a particular case.

abstract: We study a longstanding problem of identification of the fermion-monopole symmetries. We show that the integrals of motion of the system generate a nonlinear classical Z_2-graded Poisson, or quantum super- algebra, which may be treated as a nonlinear generalization of the $osp(2|2)\oplus su(2)$. In the nonlinear superalgebra, the shifted square of the full angular momentum plays the role of the central charge. Its square root is the even osp(2|2) spin generating the u(1) rotations of the supercharges. Classically, the central charge's square root has an odd counterpart whose quantum analog is, in fact, the same osp(2|2) spin operator. As an odd integral, the osp(2|2) spin generates a nonlinear supersymmetry of De Jonghe, Macfarlane, Peeters and van Holten, and may be identified as a grading operator of the nonlinear superconformal algebra.

abstract: Horowitz and Maldacena have suggested that the unitarity of the black hole S-matrix can be reconciled with Hawking's semiclassical arguments if a final-state boundary condition is imposed at the spacelike singularity inside the black hole. We point out that, in this scenario, departures from unitarity can arise due to interactions between the collapsing body and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon. The amount of information lost when a black hole evaporates depends on the extent to which these interactions are entangling.

abstract: We consider the general physical situation of a quantum system $\H_0$ interacting with a chain of exterior systems $\bigotimes_\N \H$, one after the other, during a small interval of time $h$ and following some Hamiltonian $H$ on $\H_0 \otimes \H$. We discuss the passage to the limit to continuous interactions ($h \to 0$) in a setup which allows to compute the limit of this Hamiltonian evolution in a single state space: a continuous field of exterior systems $\otimes_{\R} \H$. Surprisingly, the passage to the limit shows the necessity for 3 different time scales in $H$. The limit evolution equation is shown to spontaneously produce quantum noises terms: we obtain a quantum Langevin equation as limit of the Hamiltonian evolution. For the very first time, these quantum Langevin equations are obtained as the effective limit from repeated to continuous interactions and not only as a model. These results justify the usual quantum Langevin equations considered in continual quantum measurement or in quantum optics. We show that the three time scales correspond to the normal regime, the weak coupling limit and the low density limit. Our approach allows to consider these two physical limits altogether for the first time. Their combination produces an effective Hamiltonian on the small system, which had never been described before. We apply these results to give an Hamiltonian description of the von Neumann measurement. We also consider the approximation of continuous time quantum master equations by discrete time ones. In particular we show how any Lindblad generator is obtained as the limit of completely positive maps.

abstract: We show that the finite difference B\"acklund formula for the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians is a particular element of the transformation group on the set of Riccati equations considered by two of us in a previous paper. Then, we give a group theoretical explanation to the problem of Hamiltonians related by a first order differential operator. A generalization of the finite difference algorithm relating eigenfunctions of {\emph three} different Hamiltonians is found, and some illustrative examples of the theory are analyzed, finding new potentials for which one eigenfunction and its corresponding eigenvalue is exactly known.

abstract: As a substantial generalization of the technique for constructing canonical and the related nonlinear and q-deformed coherent states, we present here a method for constructing vector coherent states in the same spirit. These vector coherent states may have a finite or an infinite number of components. As examples we first apply the technique to construct vector coherent states using the Plancherel isometry for groups and vector coherent states associated to Clifford algebras, in particular quaternions. As physical examples, we discuss vector coherent states for a quantum optical model and finally apply the general technique to build vector coherent states over certain matrix domains.

abstract: We propose to study echo dynamics in a random matrix framework, where we assume that the perturbation is time independent, random and orthogonally invariant. This allows to use a basis in which the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal and its properties are thus largely determined by its spectral statistics. We concentrate on the effect of spectral correlations usually associated to chaos and disregard secular variations in spectral density. We obtain analytic results for the fidelity decay in the linear response regime. To extend the domain of validity, we heuristically exponentiate the linear response result. The resulting expressions, exact in the perturbative limit, are accurate approximations in the transition region between the ``Fermi golden rule'' and the perturbative regimes, as examplarily verified for a deterministic chaotic system. To sense the effect of spectral stiffness, we apply our model also to the extreme cases of random spectra and equidistant spectra. In our analytical approximations as well as in extensive Monte Carlo calculations, we find that fidelity decay is fastest for random spectra and slowest for equidistant ones, while the classical ensembles lie in between. We conclude that spectral stiffness systematically enhances fidelity.

abstract: Long periodic orbits constitute a serious drawback in Gutzwiller's theory of chaotic systems, and then it would be desirable that other classical invariants, not suffering from the same problem, could be used in the quantization of such systems. In this respect, we demonstrate how a suitable dynamical analysis of chaotic quantum spectra unveils the fundamental role played by classical invariant areas related to the stable and unstable manifolds of short periodic orbits.

abstract: A new interferometric technique is demonstrated for measuring Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) signals. Two forward-directed CARS signals are generated, one in each arm of an interferometer. The deterministic nature of the CARS process allows for these two signals, when spatially and temporally overlapped, to interfere with one another. Heterodyne detection can therefore be employed to increase the sensitivity in CARS signal detection. In addition, nonlinear CARS interferometry will facilitate the use of this spectroscopic technique for molecular contrast in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).

abstract: We introduce superposition-based quantum networks composed of (i) the classical perceptron model of multilayered, feedforward neural networks and (ii) the algebraic model of evolving reticular quantum structures as described in quantum gravity. The main feature of this model is moving from particular neural topologies to a quantum metastructure which embodies many differing topological patterns. Using quantum parallelism, training is possible on superpositions of different network topologies. As a result, not only classical transition functions, but also topology becomes a subject of training. The main feature of our model is that particular neural networks, with different topologies, are quantum states. We consider high-dimensional dissipative quantum structures as candidates for implementation of the model.

abstract: Electron interference in mesoscopic devices irradiated by external non-classical microwaves, is considered. In the case of one-mode microwaves, it is shown that both the average intensity and the spectral density of the interfering electrons are sensitive to the quantum noise of the microwaves. The results for various quantum states of the microwaves are compared and contrasted with the classical case. Separable and entangled two-mode microwaves are also considered and their effect on electron average intensity and autocorrelation, is discussed.
