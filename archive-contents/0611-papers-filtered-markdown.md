**1.    Wigner formula of rotation matrices and quantum walks**  
Takahiro Miyazaki, Makoto Katori, Norio Konno

<blockquote>
<p>
Quantization of a random-walk model is performed by giving a qudit (a multi-component wave function) to a walker at site and by introducing a quantum coin, which is a matrix representation of a unitary transformation. In quantum walks, the qudit of walker is mixed according to the quantum coin at each time step, when the walker hops to other sites. As special cases of the quantum walks driven by high-dimensional quantum coins generally studied by Brun, Carteret, and Ambainis, we study the models obtained by choosing rotation as the unitary transformation, whose matrix representations determine quantum coins. We show that Wigner's $(2j+1)$-dimensional unitary representations of rotations with half-integers $j$'s are useful to analyze the probability laws of quantum walks. For any value of half-integer $j$, convergence of all moments of walker's pseudovelocity in the long-time limit is proved. It is generally shown for the present models that, if $(2j+1)$ is even, the probability measure of limit distribution is given by a superposition of $(2j+1)/2$ terms of scaled Konno's density functions, and if $(2j+1)$ is odd, it is a superposition of $j$ terms of scaled Konno's density functions and a Dirac's delta function at the origin. For the two-, three-, and four-component models, the probability densities of limit distributions are explicitly calculated and their dependence on the parameters of quantum coins and on the initial qudit of walker is completely determined. Comparison with computer simulation results is also shown.

**2.    Continuous-Time Quantum Random Walks Require Discrete Space**  
K. Manouchehri, J.B. Wang  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611129  
<blockquote>
<p>
Quantum random walks are shown to have non-intuitive dynamics which makes them an attractive area of study for devising quantum algorithms for long-standing open problems as well as those arising in the field of quantum computing. In the case of continuous-time quantum random walks, such peculiar dynamics can arise from simple evolution operators closely resembling the quantum free-wave propagator. We investigate the divergence of quantum walk dynamics from the free-wave evolution and show that in order for continuous-time quantum walks to display their characteristic propagation, the state space must be discrete. This behavior rules out many continuous quantum systems as possible candidates for implementing continuous-time quantum random walks.

**3.    Approximate locality for quantum systems on graphs**  
Tobias J. Osborne  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 140503 (2008)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611231  
<blockquote>
<p>
In this Letter we make progress on a longstanding open problem of Aaronson and Ambainis [Theory of Computing 1, 47 (2005)]: we show that if A is the adjacency matrix of a sufficiently sparse low-dimensional graph then the unitary operator e^{itA} can be approximated by a unitary operator U(t) whose sparsity pattern is exactly that of a low-dimensional graph which gets more dense as |t| increases. Secondly, we show that if U is a sparse unitary operator with a gap \Delta in its spectrum, then there exists an approximate logarithm H of U which is also sparse. The sparsity pattern of H gets more dense as 1/\Delta increases. These two results can be interpreted as a way to convert between local continuous-time and local discrete-time processes. As an example we show that the discrete-time coined quantum walk can be realised as an approximately local continuous-time quantum walk. Finally, we use our construction to provide a definition for a fractional quantum fourier transform.

**4.    Quantum Optical Random Walk: Quantization Rules and Quantum Simulation of Asymptotics**  
Demosthenes Ellinas, Ioannis Smyrnakis  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0611265  
<blockquote>
<p>
Rules for quantizing the walker+coin parts of a classical random walk are provided by treating them as interacting quantum systems. A quantum optical random walk (QORW), is introduced by means of a new rule that treats quantum or classical noise affecting the coin's state, as sources of quantization. The long term asymptotic statistics of QORW walker's position that shows enhanced diffusion rates as compared to classical case, is exactly solved. A quantum optical cavity implementation of the walk provides the framework for quantum simulation of its asymptotic statistics. The simulation utilizes interacting two-level atoms and/or laser randomly pulsating fields with fluctuating parameters.
