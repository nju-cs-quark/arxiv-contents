abstract: The Heisenberg exchange interaction is a natural method to implement non-local (i.e., multi-qubit) quantum gates in quantum information processing. We consider quantum circuits comprising of $(SWAP)^\alpha $ gates, which are realized through the exchange interaction, and single-qubit gates. A universal two-qubit quantum circuit is constructed from only three $(SWAP)^\alpha$ gates and six single-qubit gates. We further show that three $(SWAP)^\alpha $ gates are not only sufficient, but necessary. Since six single-qubit gates are known to be necessary, our universal two-qubit circuit is optimal in terms of the number of {\em both} $(SWAP)^\alpha $ and single-qubit gates.

abstract: We review the quantum theory of a single spin magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). We concentrate on the novel technique called oscillating cantilever-driven adiabatic reversals (OSCAR), which has been used for a single spin detection (Dan Rugar, Talk on the 2004 IEEE NTC Quantum Device Technology Workshop). First we describe the quantum dynamics of the cantilever-spin system using simple estimates in the spirit of the mean field approximation. Then we present the results of our computer simulations of the Schrodinger equation for the wave function of the cantilever-spin system and of the master equation for the density matrix of the system. We demonstrate that the cantilever behaves like a quasi-classical measurement device which detects the spin projection along the effective magnetic field. We show that the OSCAR technique provides continuous monitoring of the single spin, which could be used to detect the mysterious quantum collapses of the wave function of the cantilever-spin system.

abstract: To obtain the explicit form of evolution operator in the Tavis-Cummings model we must calculate the term ${e}^{-itg(S_{+}\otimes a+S_{-}\otimes a^{\dagger})}$ explicitly which is very hard. In this paper we try to make the quantum matrix $A\equiv S_{+}\otimes a+S_{-}\otimes a^{\dagger}$ diagonal to calculate ${e}^{-itgA}$ and, moreover, to know a deep structure of the model. For the case of one, two and three atoms we give such a diagonalization which is first nontrivial examples as far as we know, and reproduce the calculations of ${e}^{-itgA}$ given in quant-ph/0404034. We also give a hint to an application to a noncommutative differential geometry. However, a quantum diagonalization is not unique and is affected by some ambiguity arising from the noncommutativity of operators in quantum physics. Our method may open a new point of view in Mathematical Physics or Quantum Physics.

abstract: Simpler encoding and decoding networks are necessary for more reliable quantum error correcting codes (QECCs). The simplification of the encoder-decoder circuit for a perfect five-qubit QECC can be derived analytically if the QECC is converted from its equivalent one-way entanglement purification protocol (1-EPP). In this work, the analytical method to simplify the encoder-decoder circuit is introduced and a circuit that is as simple as the existent simplest circuits is presented as an example. The encoder-decoder circuit presented here involves nine single- and two-qubit unitary operations, only six of which are controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates.

We also present a theoretical proposal for testing Bell's inequality in nano-electronics devices. We show that the entanglement of two electron spins can be detected in the spin filter effect in the nanostructure semiconductor / ferromagnetic semiconductor / semiconductor junction. In particular, we show how to test Bell's inequality via the measurement of the current-current correlation function in this setup.

abstract: What obstructs the realization of useful quantum cryptography is single photon scheme, or entanglement which is not applicable to the current infrastructure of optical communication network. We are concerned with the following question: Can we realize the information theoretically secure symmetric key cipher under "the finite secret key" based on quantum-optical communications? A role of quantum information theory is to give an answer for such a question. As an answer for the question, a new quantum cryptography was proposed by H.P.Yuen, which can realize a secure symmetric key cipher with high speeds(Gbps) and for long distance(1000 Km). Although some researchers claim that Yuen protocol(Y-00) is equivalent to the classical cryptography, they are all mistaken. Indeed it has no classical analogue, and also provides a generalization even in the conventional cryptography. At present, it is proved that a basic model of Y-00 has at least the security such as $H(X|Y_E)=H(K|Y_E)=H(K)$, $H(K|Y_E,X)\sim 0$ under the average photon number per signal light pulse:$<n> \sim 10000$. Towards our final goal, in this paper, we clarify a role of classical randomness(secret key) and quantum randomness in Y-00, and give a rigorous quantum mechanical interpretation of the security, showing an analysis of quantum collective attack.

Making use of feature of NMR measure and the technology of the second (discrete) Fourier transformation, our theoretical scheme can obtain the spectrum of paring model in principle. We concretely discuss the case in the concerned subspaces of pairing model and then, as an example, give out a simple initial state to get the gap of two the lowest energy levels in the given subspace. The quantum simulation to get more differences of energy levels is able to be discussed similarly.

abstract: In this thesis, the quantum Hamilton Jacobi (QHJ) formalism is used to study various exactly solvable (ES) and quasi -exactly solvable (QES) models. Using this method, we obtain the bound state eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions for the models studied. The central entity of this formalism in the logarithmic derivative of the wave function, known as the quantum momentum function (QMF).It is assumed that the point at infinity is an isolated singular point.The kowledge of the singularity structure of the QMF is used to arrive at the required solutions. We show that there are marked differences between the singularity structures of the ES and QES models.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of a particle in the Modified P\"oschl-Teller potential is derived from the group $SL(2,R)$ by applying a Group Approach to Quantization (GAQ). The explicit form of the Hamiltonian as well as the ladder operators is found in the enveloping algebra of this basic symmetry group. The present algorithm provides a physical realization of the non-unitary, finite-dimensional, irreducible representations of the $SL(2,R)$ group. The non-unitarity manifests itself in that only half of the states are normalizable, in contrast with the representations of SU(2) where all the states are physical.

Explicit semiclassical theory of purity decay is derived for integrable classical dynamics of the uncoupled system, and for localized (general Gaussian wave-packet) initial states. Purity decays as an algebraic function of time times strength of perturbation, independently of the Planck's constant.

abstract: Using a 1 to 2 transition as an analytically tractable model, we discuss in detail magneto-optical resonances of both EIA (electromagnetically induced absorption) and EIT (electromagnetically induced transparency) types in the Hanle configuration. The analysis is made for arbitrary rate of depolarizing collisions in the excited state and arbitrary elliptical field polarization. The obtained results clearly show that the main reason for the EIA sub-natural resonance is the spontaneous transfer of anisotropy from the excited level to the ground one. In the EIA case we predict the negative structures in the absortpion resonance at large field detuning. The role of the finite atom-light interaction time is briefly discussed. In addition we study non-trivial peculiarities of the resonance lineshape related to the velocity spread in a gas.

abstract: We describe a method that allows for a practical application of the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators to PT-symmetric systems defined on a complex contour. We apply this method to study the Hamiltonians $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\nu$ with $\nu\in(-2,\infty)$ that are defined along the corresponding anti-Stokes lines. In particular, we reveal the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of $H$ for the cases that $\nu$ is an even integer, so that $H=p^2\pm x^{2+\nu}$, and give a proof of the discreteness of the spectrum of $H$ for all $\nu\in(-2,\infty)$. Furthermore, we study the consequences of defining a square-well Hamiltonian on a wedge-shaped complex contour. This yields a PT-symmetric system with a finite number of real eigenvalues. We present a comprehensive analysis of this system within the framework of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. We also outline a direct pseudo-Hermitian treatment of PT-symmetric systems defined on a complex contour which clarifies the underlying mathematical structure of the formulation of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics based on the charge-conjugation operator. Our results provide a conclusive evidence that pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics provides a complete description of general PT-symmetric systems regardless of whether they are defined along the real line or a complex contour.

abstract: We study the effect of quantum interference on the structure and properties of spontaneous and stimulated transitions in a degenerate V-type three-level atom with an arbitrary total momentum of each state. Explicit expressions for the factors in the terms of the relaxation operator and stimulated transition operator with account of quantum interference effects are obtained. It has been demonstrated that the condition for the dipole transition moments to be parallel is insufficient and for conventional atoms the interference cross terms are zeros for both operators. The conditions when quantum interference influences the properties of the relaxation operators have been analysed. For the stimulated transitions this condition is shown to be anisotropy of the photon field interacting with the atoms. This case is minutely studied for the D-line of alkali metals.

We limit ourselves to single-shot gates without conditional feed-forward. We derive our results by using determinants of Vandermonde-type over a polynomial basis which is closely related to the well-known Jacobi polynomials.

abstract: Most of the standard proofs of the Bell theorem are based on the Kolmogorov axioms of probability theory. We show that these proofs contain mathematical steps that cannot be reconciled with the Kolmogorov axioms. Specifically we demonstrate that these proofs ignore the conclusion of a theorem of Vorob'ev on the consistency of joint distributions. As a consequence Bell's theorem stated in its full generality remains unproven, in particular, for extended parameter spaces that are still objective local and that include instrument parameters that are correlated by both time and instrument settings. Although the Bell theorem correctly rules out certain small classes of hidden variables, for these extended parameter spaces the standard proofs come to a halt. The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) approach is based on similar fallacious arguments. For this case we are able to present an objective local computer experiment that simulates the experimental test of GHZ performed by Pan, Bouwmeester, Daniell, Weinfurter and Zeilinger and that directly contradicts their claim that Einstein-local elements of reality can neither explain the results of quantum mechanical theory nor their experimental results.

The scheme is relatively easy to implement, requiring neither entanglement nor controlled operations during the state preparation, reading or verification stages.

We also consider briefly the case in which the measurement basis is fixed with respect to the state to be prepared, and describe the qualitative structure of the optimal bang-bang algorithm.

The small CSSs required to produce CSSs with larger amplitudes are extremely well approximated by squeezed single photons. We discuss some remarkable features of this scheme: it effectively purifies mixed initial states emitted from inefficient single photon sources and boosts negativity of Wigner functions of quantum states.

A standard technique of microphotoluminescence combined with an ultrafast photon correlation set-up allowed us to see an antibunching effect on photons emitted by excitons recombining in a single CdTe/ZnTe QD, as well as cross-correlation within the biexciton ($X_{2}$)-exciton ($X$) radiative cascade from the same dot. Fast microchannel plate photomultipliers and a time-correlated single photon module gave us an overall temporal resolution of 140 ps better than the typical exciton lifetime in II-VI QDs of about 250ps.

abstract: Since Bell's theorem, it is known that quantum correlations cannot be described by local variables (LV) alone: if one does not want to abandon classical mechanisms for correlations, a superluminal form of communication among the particles must be postulated. A natural question is whether such a postulate would imply the possibility of superluminal signaling. Here we show that the assumption of finite-speed superluminal communication indeed leads to signaling when no LV are present, and more generally when only LV derivable from quantum statistics are allowed. When the most general LV are allowed, we prove in a specific case that the model can be made again consistent with relativity, but the question remains open in general.

abstract: We study a protocol for two-qubit state guidance that does not rely on feedback mechanisms. In our scheme, entanglement can be concentrated by arranging the interactions of the qubits with a continuous variable ancilla. By properly post-selecting the outcomes of repeated measurements of the state of the ancilla, the qubit state is driven to have a desired amount of purity and entanglement. We stress the primary role played by the first iterations of the protocol. Inefficiencies in the detection operations can be fully taken into account.

abstract: It has recently been shown that all causal correlations between two parties which output each one bit, a and b, when receiving each one bit, x and y, can be expressed as convex combinations of local correlations (i.e., correlations that can be simulated with local random variables) and non-local correlations of the form a+b=xy mod 2. We show that a single instance of the latter elementary non-local correlation suffices to simulate exactly all possible projective measurements that can be performed on the singlet state of two qubits, with no communication needed at all. This elementary non-local correlation thus defines some unit of non-locality, which we call a nl-bit.

abstract: We demonstrate the relevance of entanglement, Bell inequalities and decoherence in particle physics. In particular, we study in detail the features of the ``strange'' $K^0 \bar K^0$ system as an example of entangled meson--antimeson systems. The analogies and differences to entangled spin--1/2 or photon systems are worked, the effects of a unitary time evolution of the meson system is demonstrated explicitly. After an introduction we present several types of Bell inequalities and show a remarkable connection to CP violation. We investigate the stability of entangled quantum systems pursuing the question how possible decoherence might arise due to the interaction of the system with its ``environment''. The decoherence is strikingly connected to the entanglement loss of common entanglement measures. Finally, some outlook of the field is presented.

We discuss the accuracy with which quantum states prepared in a Josephson junction qubit can be stored in a nanoelectromechanical resonator and then transfered back to the junction. We find that the fidelity of the memory operation depends on both the junction-resonator coupling strength and the location of the state on the Bloch sphere. Although we specifically focus on a large-area, current-biased Josesphson junction phase qubit coupled to the dilatational mode of a piezoelectric nanoelectromechanical disk resonator, many our results will apply to other qubit-oscillator models.

abstract: We study the equivalence between a realistic quantum key distribution protocol using coherent states and homodyne detection and a formal entanglement purification protocol. Maximally-entangled qubit pairs that one can extract in the formal protocol correspond to secret key bits in the realistic protocol. More specifically, we define a qubit encoding scheme that allows the formal protocol to produce more than one entangled qubit pair per coherent state, or equivalently for the realistic protocol, more than one secret key bit. The entanglement parameters are estimated using quantum tomography. We analyze the properties of the encoding scheme and investigate its application to the important case of the attenuation channel.

abstract: The statement of E.R. Loubenets, Phys. Rev. A 69, 042102 (2004), that separable states can violate classical probabilistic constraints is based on a misleading definition of classicality, which is much narrower than Bell's concept of local hidden variables. In a Bell type setting the notion of classicality used by Loubenets corresponds to the assumption of perfect correlations if the same observable is measured on both sides. While it is obvious that most separable states do not satisfy this assumption, this does not constitute "non-classical" behaviour in any usual sense of the word.

abstract: A scheme for non-conditional generation of long-living maximally entangled states between two spatially well separated atoms is proposed. In the scheme, $\Lambda$-type atoms pass a resonator-like equipment of dispersing and absorbing macroscopic bodies giving rise to body-assisted electromagnetic field resonances of well-defined heights and widths. Strong atom-field coupling is combined with weak atom-field coupling to realize entanglement transfer from the dipole-allowed transitions to the dipole-forbidden transitions, thereby the entanglement being preserved when the atoms depart from the bodies and from each other. The theory is applied to the case of the atoms passing by a microsphere.

abstract: We study the algebra of complex polynomials which remain invariant under the action of the local Clifford group under conjugation. Within this algebra, we consider the linear spaces of homogeneous polynomials degree by degree and construct bases for these vector spaces for each degree, thereby obtaining a generating set of polynomial invariants. Our approach is based on the description of Clifford operators in terms of linear operations over GF(2). Such a study of polynomial invariants of the local Clifford group is mainly of importance in quantum coding theory, in particular in the classification of binary quantum codes. Some applications in entanglement theory and quantum computing are briefly discussed as well.

We present an analytical model to interpret the experimental data and identify the homogeneous and inhomogeneous dephasing mechanisms. Our scheme to prepare and detect the atomic hyperfine state is applied at the level of a single atom as well as for ensembles of up to 50 atoms.

For different atomic array configurations, one can properly steer the signal and the control lights to generate different forms of atomic entanglement within the framework of linear optics. These results shed new light on designing the versatile quantum memory devices by using, e.g., an atomic grid.

abstract: We generalize a proposal for detecting single phonon transitions in a single nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) to include the intrinsic anharmonicity of each mechanical oscillator. In this scheme two NEMS oscillators are coupled via a term quadratic in the amplitude of oscillation for each oscillator. One NEMS oscillator is driven and strongly damped and becomes a transducer for phonon number in the other measured oscillator. We derive the conditions for this measurement scheme to be quantum limited and find a condition on the size of the anharmonicity. We also derive the relation between the phase diffusion back-action noise due to number measurement and the localization time for the measured system to enter a phonon number eigenstate. We relate both these time scales to the strength of the measured signal, which is an induced current proportional to the position of the readout oscillator.

abstract: Quantum finite automata have been studied intensively since their introduction in late 1990s as a natural model of a quantum computer with finite-dimensional quantum memory space. This paper seeks their direct application to interactive proof systems in which a mighty quantum prover communicates with a quantum-automaton verifier through a common communication cell. Our quantum interactive proof systems are juxtaposed to Dwork-Stockmeyer's classical interactive proof systems whose verifiers are two-way probabilistic automata. We demonstrate strengths and weaknesses of our systems and further study how various restrictions on the behaviors of quantum-automaton verifiers affect the power of quantum interactive proof systems.

abstract: Boolean functions are important building blocks in cryptography for their wide application in both stream and block cipher systems. For cryptanalysis of such systems one tries to find out linear functions that are correlated to the Boolean functions used in the crypto system. Let $f$ be an $n$-variable Boolean function and its Walsh spectra is denoted by $W_f(\omega)$ at the point $\omega \in \{0, 1\}^n$. The Boolean function is available in the form of an oracle. We like to find an $\omega$ such that $W_f(\omega) \neq 0$ as this will provide one of the linear functions which are correlated to $f$. We show that the quantum algorithm proposed by Deutsch and Jozsa (1992) solves the above mentioned problem in constant time. However, the best known classical algorithm to solve this problem requires exponential time in $n$. We also analyse certain classes of cryptographically significant Boolean functions and highlight how the basic Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm performs on them.

abstract: We exploit Grover operator of database search algorithm for weight decision algorithm. In this research, weight decision problem is to find an exact weight w from given two weights as w1 and w2 where w1+w2=1 and 0<w1<w2<1. Firstly, if a Boolean function is given and when weights are {1/4,3/4}, we can find w with only one application of Grover operator. Secondly, if we apply k many times of Grover operator, we can decide w from the set of weights {sin^2(\frac{k}{2k+1}\frac{\pi}{2}) cos^2(\frac{k}{2k+1}\frac{\pi}{2})}. Finally, by changing the last two Grover operators with two phase conditions, we can decide w from given any set of two weights. To decide w with a sure success, if the quantum algorithm requires O(k) Grover steps, then the best known classical algorithm requires \Omega(k^s) steps where s>2. Hence the quantum algorithm achieves at least quadratic speedup.

abstract: The scheme for construction of distances, presented in the previous paper quant-ph/0005087, v.1 (Ref. 1) is amended. The formulation of Proposition 1 of Ref. 1 does not ensure the triangle inequality, therefore some of the functionals D(a,b) in Ref. 1 are in fact quasi-distances. In this note we formulate sufficient conditions for a functional D(a,b) of the (squared) form D(a,b)^2 = f(a)^2 + f(b)^2 - 2f(a)f(b)g(a,b) to be a distance and provide some examples of such distances. A one parameter generalization of a bounded distance of the (squared) form D(a,b)^2 = D_0^2 (1 - g(a,b)), which includes the known Bures-Uhlmann and Hilbert-Schmidt distances between quantum states, is established.

abstract: We prove that sufficiently many copies of a bipartite entangled pure state can always be transformed into some copies of another one with certainty by local quantum operations and classical communication. The efficiency of such a transformation is characterized by deterministic entanglement exchange rate, and it is proved to be always positive and bounded from top by the infimum of the ratios of Renyi's entropies of source state and target state. A careful analysis shows that the deterministic entanglement exchange rate cannot be increased even in the presence of catalysts. As an application, we show that there can be two incomparable states with deterministic entanglement exchange rate strictly exceeding 1.

abstract: We analyze and study the effects of locality on the fault-tolerance threshold for quantum computation. We analytically estimate how the threshold will depend on a scale parameter r which estimates the scale-up in the size of the circuit due to encoding. We carry out a detailed semi-numerical threshold analysis for concatenated coding using the 7-qubit CSS code in the local and `nonlocal' setting. First, we find that the threshold in the local model for the [[7,1,3]] code has a 1/r dependence, which is in correspondence with our analytical estimate. Second, the threshold, beyond the 1/r dependence, does not depend too strongly on the noise levels for transporting qubits. Beyond these results, we find that it is important to look at more than one level of concatenation in order to estimate the threshold and that it may be beneficial in certain places, like in the transportation of qubits, to do error correction only infrequently.

In this case neither quantum error correction/avoidance, nor dynamical decoupling applies. We show that using tracking-control, i.e., the conditioning of the control field on the state of the qubit, it is possible to maintain coherence for finite time durations, until the control field diverges.

Moreover the model predicts, for different conditions of the same experiment, a decoherence-free subspace. These conditions are analyzed and slightly different experiments suggested in order to test its viability.

abstract: For continuous-variable systems, we introduce a measure of entanglement, the continuous variable tangle ({\em contangle}), with the purpose of quantifying the distributed (shared) entanglement in multimode, multipartite Gaussian states. This is achieved by a proper convex roof extension of the squared logarithmic negativity. We prove that the contangle satisfies the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality in all three--mode Gaussian states, and in all fully symmetric $N$--mode Gaussian states, for arbitrary $N$. For three--mode pure states we prove that the residual entanglement is a genuine tripartite entanglement monotone under Gaussian local operations and classical communication. We show that pure, symmetric three--mode Gaussian states allow a promiscuous entanglement sharing, having both maximum tripartite residual entanglement and maximum couplewise entanglement between any pair of modes. These states are thus simultaneous continuous-variable analogs of both the GHZ and the $W$ states of three qubits: in continuous-variable systems monogamy does not prevent promiscuity, and the inequivalence between different classes of maximally entangled states, holding for systems of three or more qubits, is removed.

Also, the Pancharatnam phase change during the passage through an orthogonal state is shown to be either $\pi$ or zero (mod $2\pi$). All the off-diagonal geometric phases can be obtained from the projective geometric phase calculated with our generalized connection.

abstract: We consider the optimal cloning of quantum coherent states with single-clone and joint fidelity as figures of merit. Both optimal fidelities are attained for phase space translation covariant cloners. Remarkably, the joint fidelity is maximized by a Gaussian cloner, whereas the single-clone fidelity can be enhanced by non-Gaussian operations: a symmetric non-Gaussian 1-to-2 cloner can achieve a single-clone fidelity of approximately 0.6826, perceivably higher than the optimal fidelity of 2/3 in a Gaussian setting. This optimal cloner can be realized by means of an optical parametric amplifier supplemented with a particular source of non-Gaussian bimodal states. Finally, we show that the single-clone fidelity of the optimal 1-to-infinity cloner, corresponding to a measure-and-prepare scheme, cannot exceed 1/2. This value is achieved by a Gaussian scheme and cannot be surpassed even with supplemental bound entangled states.

To this aim, we derive a family of Bell inequalities which require three measurement settings for each party and are maximally violated by graph states. In turn, for each graph state there is an inequality maximally violated only by that state. We show that for certain types of graph states the violation of these inequalities increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We also discuss connections to other entanglement properties such as the positivity of the partial transpose or the geometric measure of entanglement.

abstract: I consider in this book a formulation of Quantum Mechanics. Usually QM is formulated based on the notion of time and space, both of which are thought a priori given quantities or notions. However, when we try to define the notion of velocity or momentum, we encounter a difficulty as we will see in chapter 1. The problem is that if the notion of time is given a priori, the velocity is definitely determined when given a position, which contradicts the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg. We then set the basis of QM on the notion of position and momentum operators as in chapter 2. Time of a local system then is defined approximately as a ratio $|x|/|v|$ between the space coordinate $x$ and the velocity $v$. In this formulation of QM, we can keep the uncertainty principle, and time is a quantity that does not have precise values unlike the usually supposed notion of time has. The feature of local time is that it is a time proper to each local system, which is defined as a finite set of quantum mechanical particles. We now have an infinite number of local times that are unique and proper to each local system. Based on the notion of local time, the motion inside a local system is described by the usual Schr\"odinger equation. We investigate such motion in a given local system in part II. This is a usual quantum mechanics. After some excursion of the investigation of local motion, we consider in part III the relative relation or motion between plural local systems. In the final part IV, we will prove that there is at least one Universe wave function $\phi$ in which all local systems have local motions and thus local times. This concludes our formulation of Quantum Mechanics.

abstract: We describe a mechanism for realizing a controlled phase gate for solid-state charge qubits. By augmenting the positionally defined qubit with an auxiliary state, and changing the charge distribution in the three-dot system, we are able to effectively switch the Coulombic interaction, effecting an entangling gate. We consider two architectures, and numerically investigate their robustness to gate noise.

Plasmons are shown to coherently exist at two different times separated by much more than the plasmons lifetime. This kind of entanglement involving light and matter is expected to be useful for future processing and storing of quantum information.

abstract: Uniformly controlled one-qubit gates are quantum gates which can be represented as direct sums of two-dimensional unitary operators acting on a single qubit. We present a quantum gate array which implements any n-qubit gate of this type using at most 2^{n-1} - 1 controlled-NOT gates, 2^{n-1} one-qubit gates and a single diagonal n-qubit gate. The circuit is based on the so-called quantum multiplexor, for which we provide a modified construction. We illustrate the versatility of these gates by applying them to the decomposition of a general n-qubit gate and a local state preparation procedure. Moreover, we study their implementation using only nearest-neighbor gates. We give upper bounds for the one-qubit and controlled-NOT gate counts for all the aforementioned applications. In all four cases, the proposed circuit topologies either improve on or achieve the previously reported upper bounds for the gate counts. Thus, they provide the most efficient method for general gate decompositions currently known.

The Hamiltonians include two bosons and one fermion have been transformed in the form of the one variable differential equations and the conditions for its solvability have been discussed. It is observed that the Hamiltonians of the various physical systems can be written in terms of the generators of the osp(2,1) superalgebra and under some certain conditions their eigenstates can exactly be obtained. In particular, the procedure given here is useful in determining eigenstates of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians.

Pauli's theorem is bypassed because the correspondence between time and energy is not given by the standard Fourier transformation, but by a variant thereof known as the holomorphic Fourier transformation.

abstract: We propose a system of information-theoretic axioms from which we derive the formalism of quantum theory. Part I is devoted to the conceptual foundations of the information-theoretic approach. We argue that this approach belongs to the epistemological framework depicted as a loop of existences. In Part II we derive the quantum formalism from information-theoretic axioms and we analyze the twofold role of observer as physical system and as informational agent. Quantum logical techniques are then introduced, and we prove theorems reconstructing elements of the formalism. In Part III, we introduce the formalism of C*-algebras and give it an information theoretic interpretation. We analyze the conceptual underpinnings of the theory of modular automorphisms and we give an information-theoretic justification for the emergence of time in the algebraic approach. We conclude by giving a list of open questions, including topics in cognitive science, decision theory, and information technology.

abstract: The information carrier of today's communications, a weak pulse of light, is an intrinsically quantum object. As a consequence, complete information about the pulse cannot, even in principle, be perfectly recorded in a classical memory. In the field of quantum information this has led to a long standing challenge: how to achieve a high-fidelity transfer of an independently prepared quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum state? Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for such quantum memory based on atomic ensembles. We demonstrate for the first time a recording of an externally provided quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum memory with a fidelity up to 70%, significantly higher than that for the classical recording. Quantum storage of light is achieved in three steps: an interaction of light with atoms, the subsequent measurement on the transmitted light, and the feedback onto the atoms conditioned on the measurement result. Density of recorded states 33% higher than that for the best classical recording of light on atoms is achieved. A quantum memory lifetime of up to 4 msec is demonstrated.

abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of unambiguous discrimination between a set of mixed quantum states. We first divide the density matrix of each mixed state into two parts by the fact that it comes from ensemble of pure quantum states. The first part will not contribute anything to the discrimination, the second part has support space linearly independent to each other. Then the problem we consider can be reduced to a problem in which the strategy of set discrimination can be used in designing measurements to discriminate mixed states unambiguously. We find a necessary and sufficient condition of unambiguous mixed state discrimination, and also point out that searching the optimal success probability of unambiguous discrimination is mathematically the well-known semi-definite programming problem. A upper bound of the optimal success probability is also presented. Finally, We generalize the concept of set discrimination to mixed state and point out that the problem of discriminating it unambiguously is equivalent to that of unambiguously discriminating mixed states.

abstract: A scheme of three-particle entanglement purification is presented in this work. The physical system undertaken for investigation is dot-like single quantum well excitons independently coupled through a single microcavity mode. The theoretical framework for the proposed scheme is based on the quantum jump approach for analyzing the progress of the trible-exciton entanglement as a series of conditional measurement has been taken on the cavity field state. We first investigate how cavity photon affects the purity of the double-exciton state and the purification efficiency in two-particle protocol. Then we extend the two-particle case and conclude that the three-exciton state can be purified into W state, which involves the one-photon-trapping phenomenon, with a high yield. Finally, an achievable setup for purification using only modest and presently feasible technologies is also proposed.

abstract: In practical quantum key distribution, weak coherent state is often used and the channel transmittance can be very small therefore the protocol could be totally insecure under the photon-number-splitting attack. We propose an efficient method to verify the upper bound of the fraction of counts caused by multi-photon pluses transmitted from Alice to Bob, given whatever type of Eve's action. The protocol simply uses two coherent states for the signal pulses and vacuum for decoy pulse. Our verified upper bound is sufficiently tight for QKD with very lossy channel, in both asymptotic case and non-asymptotic case. The coherent states with mean photon number from 0.2 to 0.5 can be used in practical quantum cryptography. We show that so far our protocol is the $only$ decoy-state protocol that really works for currently existing set-ups.

abstract: A qualification is suggested for the counterfactual reasoning involved in some aspects of time-symmetric quantum theory (which involves ensembles selected by both the initial and final states). The qualification is that the counterfactual reasoning should only apply to times when the quantum system has been subjected to physical interactions which place it in a ``measurement-ready condition" for the unperformed experiment on which the counterfactual reasoning is based. The defining characteristic of a "measurement-ready condition" is that a quantum system could be found to have the counterfactually ascribed property without direct physical interaction with the eigenstate corresponding to that property.

abstract: We consider the Fermi quantization of the classical damped harmonic oscillator (dho). In past work on the subject, authors double the phase space of the dho in order to close the system at each moment in time. For an infinite-dimensional phase space, this method requires one to construct a representation of the CAR algebra for each time. We show that unitary dilation of the contraction semigroup governing the dynamics of the system is a logical extension of the doubling procedure, and it allows one to avoid the mathematical difficulties encountered with the previous method.

abstract: {\it We first give a geometrical description of the action of the parity operator ($\hat{P}$) on non relativistic spin ${{1}\over{2}}$ Pauli spinors in terms of bundle theory. The relevant bundle, $SU(2)\odot \Z_2\to O(3)$, is a non trivial extension of the universal covering group $SU(2)\to SO(3)$. $\hat{P}$ is the non relativistic limit of the corresponding Dirac matrix operator ${\cal P}=i\gamma_0$ and obeys $\hat{P}^2=-1$. Then, from the direct product of O(3) by $\Z_2$, naturally induced by the structure of the galilean group, we identify, in its double cover, the time reversal operator ($\hat{T}$) acting on spinors, and its product with $\hat{P}$. Both, $\hat{P}$ and $\hat{T}$, generate the group $\Z_4 \times \Z_2$. As in the case of parity, $\hat{T}$ is the non relativistic limit of the corresponding Dirac matrix operator ${\cal T}=\gamma^3 \gamma^1$, and obeys $\hat{T}^2=-1$.}

abstract: In this thesis we study continuously observed open quantum systems from the point of view of quantum filtering theory. The conditioned state of the open system obeys a non-commutative or quantum analogue of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation in classical filtering theory. The thesis consists out of four chapters. The first chapter is a brief introduction to quantum probability theory and quantum stochastic calculus. The second chapter is a description of a photon counting experiment in continuous time within the framework of Davies and Srinivas. The third chapter focusses on the derivation of the quantum filtering or Belavkin equation from the quantum stochastic differential equation governing the interaction between the open system and its environment, the electromagnetic field. The fourth chapter shows how the quantum filtering equation can be used to control quantum systems.

abstract: We study theoretically and experimentally the quantum properties of a type II frequency degenerate optical parametric oscillator below threshold with a quarter-wave plate inserted inside the cavity which induces a linear coupling between the orthogonally polarized signal and idler fields. This original device provides a good insight into general properties of two-mode gaussian states, illustrated in terms of covariance matrix. We report on the experimental generation of two-mode squeezed vacuum on non-orthogonal quadratures depending on the plate angle. After a simple operation, the entanglement is maximized and put into standard form, \textit{i.e.} quantum correlations and anti-correlations on orthogonal quadratures. A half-sum of squeezed variances as low as $0.33 \pm 0.02$, well below the unit limit for inseparability, is obtained and the entanglement measured by the entropy of formation.

This allows one to rephrase and unify previous work on phase references, reference frames, and superselection rules.

abstract: In their 1936 founding paper on quantum logic, Birkhoff and von Neumann postulated that the lattice describing the experimental propositions concerning a quantum system is orthocomplemented. We prove that this postulate fails for the lattice L_sep describing a compound system consisting of so called separated quantum systems. By separated we mean two systems prepared in different ``rooms'' of the lab, and before any interaction takes place. In that case the state of the compound system is necessarily a product state. As a consequence, Dirac's superposition principle fails, and therefore L_sep cannot satisfy all Piron's axioms. In previous works, assuming that L_sep is orthocomplemented, it was argued that L_sep is not orthomodular and fails to have the covering property. Here we prove that L_sep cannot admit and orthocomplementation. Moreover, we propose a natural model for L_sep which has the covering property.

abstract: Pseudo-random operators consist of sets of operators that exhibit many of the important statistical features of uniformly distributed random operators. Such pseudo-random sets of operators are most useful whey they may be parameterized and generated on a quantum processor in a way that requires exponentially fewer resources than direct implementation of the uniformly random set. Efficient pseudo-random operators can overcome the exponential cost of random operators required for quantum communication tasks such as super-dense coding of quantum states and approximately secure quantum data-hiding, and enable efficient stochastic methods for noise estimation on prototype quantum processors. This paper summarizes some recently published work demonstrating a random circuit method for the implementation of pseudo-random unitary operators on a quantum processor [Emerson et al., Science 302:2098 (Dec.~19, 2003)], and further elaborates the theory and applications of pseudo-random states and operators.

abstract: In spite of many results in quantum information theory, the complex nature of compound systems is far from being clear. In general the information is a mixture of local, and non-local ("quantum") information. To make this point more clear, we develop and investigate the quantum information processing paradigm in which parties sharing a multipartite state distill local information. The amount of information which is lost because the parties must use a classical communication channel is the deficit. This scheme can be viewed as complementary to the notion of distilling entanglement. After reviewing the paradigm, we show that the upper bound for the deficit is given by the relative entropy distance to so-called psuedo-classically correlated states; the lower bound is the relative entropy of entanglement. This implies, in particular, that any entangled state is informationally nonlocal i.e. has nonzero deficit. We also apply the paradigm to defining the thermodynamical cost of erasing entanglement. We show the cost is bounded from below by relative entropy of entanglement. We demonstrate the existence of several other non-local phenomena. For example,we prove the existence of a form of non-locality without entanglement and with distinguishability. We analyze the deficit for several classes of multipartite pure states and obtain that in contrast to the GHZ state, the Aharonov state is extremely nonlocal (and in fact can be thought of as quasi-nonlocalisable). We also show that there do not exist states, for which the deficit is strictly equal to the whole informational content (bound local information). We then discuss complementary features of information in distributed quantum systems. Finally we discuss the physical and theoretical meaning of the results and pose many open questions.

abstract: We give an operational definition of the quantum, classical and total amount of correlations in a bipartite quantum state. We argue that these quantities can be defined via the amount of work (noise) that is required to erase (destroy) the correlations: for the total correlation, we have to erase completely, for the quantum correlation one has to erase until a separable state is obtained, and the classical correlation is the maximal correlation left after erasing the quantum correlations. In particular, we show that the total amount of correlations is equal to the quantum mutual information, thus providing it with a direct operational interpretation for the first time. As a byproduct, we obtain a direct, operational and elementary proof of strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.

Entanglement between a single photon (signal) and a two-component ensemble of cold rubidium atoms is used to project the quantum memory element (the atomic ensemble) onto any desired state by measuring the signal in a suitable basis. The atomic qubit is read out by stimulating directional emission of a single photon (idler) from the (entangled) collective state of the ensemble. Faithful atomic memory preparation and read-out are verified by the observed correlations between the signal and the idler photons. These results enable implementation of distributed quantum networking.

A specific measurement on one of the two output spatial modes leads to the non-local bunching of the photons of the other mode, forming the desired multiphoton path entangled state. We present experimental results for the case of a heralded two-photon path entangled state and show how to extend this scheme to higher photon numbers.

abstract: There has been considerable progress in electro-statically emptying, and re-filling, quantum dots with individual electrons. Typically the quantum dot is defined by electrostatic gates on a GaAs/AlGaAs modulation doped heterostructure. We report the filling of such a quantum dot by a single photo-electron, originating from an individual photon. The electrostatic dot can be emptied and reset in a controlled fashion before the arrival of each photon. The trapped photo-electron is detected by a point contact transistor integrated adjacent to the electrostatic potential trap. Each stored photo-electron causes a persistent negative step in the transistor channel current. Such a controllable, benign, single photo-electron detector could allow for information transfer between flying photon qubits and stored electron qubits.

On the premise that a position basis plays a special role in wavefunction collapse, we deduce to formalize spontaneous localization of wavefunction on the analogy drawn from thermodynamics, in which a characteristic energy scale and a time scale are introduced to separate quantum and classical regimes.

abstract: Two-flavor atom laser in a vortex state is obtained and analyzed via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) technique in a five-level $M$ type system by using two probe lights with $\pm z$-directional orbital angular momentum $\pm l\hbar$, respectively. Together with the original transfer technique of quantum states from light to matter waves, the present result can be extended to generate continuous two-flavor vortex atom laser with non-classical atoms.

abstract: We address the problem of non-orthogonal two-state discrimination when multiple copies of the unknown state are available. We give the optimal strategy when only fixed individual measurements are allowed and show that its error probability saturates the collective (lower) bound asymptotically. We also give the optimal strategy when adaptivity of individual von Neumann measurements is allowed (which requires classical communication), and show that the corresponding error probability is exactly equal to the collective one for any number of copies. We show that this strategy can be regarded as Bayesian updating.

abstract: In this article we propose an alternate model for the so called {\it protective measurements}, more appropriately {\it adiabatic measurements} of a spin 1/2 system where the {\it apparatus} is also a quantum system with a {\em finite dimensional Hilbert space}. This circumvents several technical as well as conceptual issues that arise when dealing with an infinite dimensional Hilbert space as in the analysis of conventional Stern-Gerlach experiment. Here also it is demonstrated that the response of the detector is continuous and it {\it directly} measures {\em expectation values without altering the state of the system}(when the unknown original state is a {\it nondegenerate eigenstate of the system Hamiltonian}, in the limit of {\em ideal} adiabatic conditions. We have also computed the corrections arising out of the inevitable departures from ideal adiabaticity i.e the time of measurement being large but finite. To overcome the {\em conceptual} difficulties with a {\it quantum apparatus}, we have simulated a {\it classical apparatus} as a {\em large} assembly of spin-1/2 systems. We end this article with a conclusion and a discussion of some future issues.

abstract: We investigate the time-dependent variance of the fidelity with which an initial narrow wavepacket is reconstructed after its dynamics is time-reversed with a perturbed Hamiltonian. In the semiclassical regime of perturbation, we show that the variance first rises algebraically up to a critical time $t_c$, after which it decays. To leading order in the effective Planck's constant $\hbar_{\rm eff}$, this decay is given by the sum of a classical term $\simeq \exp[-2 \lambda t]$, a quantum term $\simeq 2 \hbar_{\rm eff} \exp[-\Gamma t]$ and a mixed term $\simeq 2 \exp[-(\Gamma+\lambda)t]$. Compared to the behavior of the average fidelity, this allows for the extraction of the classical Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ in a larger parameter range. Our results are confirmed by numerical simulations.

abstract: We present a method to construct entanglement measures for pure states of multipartite qubit systems. The key element of our approach is an antilinear operator that we call {\em comb} in reference to the {\em hairy-ball theorem}. For qubits (or spin 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\CC)$. This implies that the {\em filters} obtained from the combs are entanglement monotones by construction. We give alternative formulae for the concurrence and the 3-tangle as expectation values of certain antilinear operators. As an application we discuss inequivalent types of genuine four-qubit entanglement.

abstract: We discuss the semiclassical limit of the entanglement for the class of closed pure systems. By means of analytical and numerical calculations we obtain two main results: (i) the short-time entanglement does not depend on Planck's constant and (ii) the long-time entanglement increases as more semiclassical regimes are attained. On one hand, this result is in contrast with the idea that the entanglement should be destroyed when the macroscopic limit is reached. On the other hand, it emphasizes the role played by decoherence in the process of emergence of the classical world. We also found that, for Gaussian initial states, the entanglement dynamics may be described by an entirely classical entropy in the semiclassical limit.

abstract: We discuss special k=sqrt{2m(E-V(x))/\hbar^2}=0 (i. e. zero-curvature) solutions of the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation in several model systems which have been used as idealized versions of various quantum well structures. We consider infinite well plus Dirac delta function cases (where E=V(x)=0) and piecewise-constant potentials, such as asymmetric infinite wells (where E=V(x)=V_0>0). We also construct supersymmetric partner potentials for several of the zero-energy solutions in these cases. One application of zero-curvature solutions in the infinite well plus delta-function case is the construction of `designer' wavefunctions, namely zero-energy wavefunctions of essentially arbitrary shape, obtained through the proper placement and choice of strength of the delta-functions.

abstract: We expand a set of notions recently introduced providing the general setting for a universal representation of the quantum structure on which quantum information stands. The dynamical evolution process associated with generic quantum information manipulation is based on the (re)coupling theory of SU(2) angular momenta. Such scheme automatically incorporates all the essential features that make quantum information encoding much more efficient than classical: it is fully discrete; it deals with inherently entangled states, naturally endowed with a tensor product structure; it allows for generic encoding patterns. The model proposed can be thought of as the non-Boolean generalization of the quantum circuit model, with unitary gates expressed in terms of 3nj coefficients connecting inequivalent binary coupling schemes of n+1 angular momentum variables, as well as Wigner rotations in the eigenspace of the total angular momentum. A crucial role is played by elementary j-gates (6j symbols) which satisfy algebraic identities that make the structure of the model similar to "state sum models", employed in discretizing Topological Quantum Field Theories and quantum gravity. The spin network simulator can thus be viewed also as a Combinatorial QFT model for computation. The semiclassical limit (large j's) is discussed.

abstract: Recently developed quantum algorithms suggest that in principle, quantum computers can solve problems such as simulation of physical systems more efficiently than classical computers. Much remains to be done to implement these conceptual ideas into actual quantum computers. As a small-scale demonstration of their capability, we simulate a simple many-fermion problem, the Fano-Anderson model, using liquid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). We carefully designed our experiment so that the resource requirement would scale up polynomially with the size of the quantum system to be simulated. The experimental results allow us to assess the limits of the degree of quantum control attained in these kinds of experiments. The simulation of other physical systems, with different particle statistics, is also discussed.

abstract: The task of decoupling, i.e., removing unwanted interactions in a system Hamiltonian and/or couplings with an environment (decoherence), plays an important role in controlling quantum systems. There are many efficient decoupling schemes based on combinatorial concepts like orthogonal arrays, difference schemes and Hadamard matrices. So far these (combinatorial) decoupling schemes have relied on the ability to effect sequences of instantaneous, arbitrarily strong control Hamiltonians (bang-bang controls). To overcome the shortcomings of bang-bang control Viola and Knill proposed a method called Eulerian decoupling that allows the use of bounded-strength controls for decoupling. However, their method was not directly designed to take advantage of the composite structure of multipartite quantum systems. In this paper we define a combinatorial structure called an Eulerian orthogonal array. It merges the desirable properties of orthogonal arrays and Eulerian cycles in Cayley graphs (that are the basis of Eulerian decoupling). We show that this structure gives rise to decoupling schemes with bounded-strength control Hamiltonians that can be applied to composite quantum systems with few body Hamiltonians and special couplings with the environment. Furthermore, we show how to construct Eulerian orthogonal arrays having good parameters in order to obtain efficient decoupling schemes.

Graphs of the self energy in hydrogen-like ions with nuclear charge number between 20 and 110 are given for a large number of states. The self-energy is the largest contribution of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) to the energy levels of these atomic systems. These results greatly expand the number of levels for which the self energy is known with a controlled and high precision. Applications include the adjustment of the Rydberg constant and atomic calculations that take into account QED effects.

abstract: It is known that the quantum fidelity, as a measure of the closeness of two quantum states, is operationally equivalent to the minimal overlap of the probability distributions of the two states over all possible POVMs; the POVM realizing the minimum is optimal. We consider the ability of homodyne detection to distinguish two single-mode Gaussian states, and investigate to what extent it is optimal in this information-theoretic sense. We completely identify the conditions under which homodyne detection makes an optimal distinction between two single-mode Gaussian states of the same mean, and show that if the Gaussian states are pure, they are always optimally distinguished.

The quantum noise observables are found to scale markedly differently with scattering parameters compared to classical noise observables. The measurements are explained with a full quantum model of multiple scattering.

It is shown that the devised multi-circuit symmetrized evolution endows the system with a two-fold resilience against decoherence: insensitivity to thermal fluctuations and quantum dissipation.

abstract: We propose a method for controlling the decoherence of a driven qubit that is strongly coupled to a reservoir, when the qubit resonance frequency is close to a continuum edge of the reservoir spectum. This strong-coupling regime is outside the scope of existing methods of decoherence control. We demonstate that an appropriate sequence of nearly abrupt changes of the resonance frequency can protect the qubit state from decay and decoherence more effectively than the intuitively obvious alternative, which is to fix the resonance well within a forbidden bandgap of the reservoir spectrum, as far as possible from the continuum edge. The "counterintuitive" nonadiabatic method outlined here can outperform its adiabatic counterparts in maintaining a high fidelity of quantum logic operations. The remarkable effectiveness of the proposed method, which requires much lower rates of frequency changes than previously proposed control methods, is due to the ability of appropriately alternating detunings from the continuum edge to augment the interference of the emitted and back-scattered quanta, thereby helping to stabilize the qubit state against decay. Applications to the control of decoherence near the edge of radiative, vibrational an photoionization continua are discussed.

abstract: As a qubit is a two-level quantum system whose state space is spanned by |0>, |1>, so a qudit is a d-level quantum system whose state space is spanned by |0>,...,|d-1>. Quantum computation has stimulated much recent interest in algorithms factoring unitary evolutions of an n-qubit state space into component two-particle unitary evolutions. In the absence of symmetry, Shende, Markov and Bullock use Sard's theorem to prove that at least C 4^n two-qubit unitary evolutions are required, while Vartiainen, Moettoenen, and Salomaa (VMS) use the QR matrix factorization and Gray codes in an optimal order construction involving two-particle evolutions. In this work, we note that Sard's theorem demands C d^{2n} two-qudit unitary evolutions to construct a generic (symmetry-less) n-qudit evolution. However, the VMS result applied to virtual-qubits only recovers optimal order in the case that d is a power of two. We further construct a QR decomposition for d-multi-level quantum logics, proving a sharp asymptotic of Theta(d^{2n}) two-qudit gates and thus closing the complexity question for all d-level systems (d finite.) Gray codes are not required, and the optimal Theta(d^{2n}) asymptotic also applies to gate libraries where two-qudit interactions are restricted by a choice of certain architectures.

We present a self--contained overview of the method, we give new insights on some of its features and we apply it to investigate problems which are of interest for quantum information theory: We analyze the phase space representation of stabilizer states and quantum error correction codes and present a phase space solution to the so--called ``mean king problem''.

abstract: The consistency of quantum adiabatic theorem has been doubted recently. It is shown in the present paper that the difference between the adiabatic solution and the exact solution to the Schrodinger equation with a slowly changing driving Hamiltonian is small; while the difference between their time derivatives is not small. This explains why substituting the adiabatic solution back into Schrodinger equation leads to "inconsisitency" of the adiabatic theorem. Physics is determined completely by the state vector, and not by its time drivative. Therefore the quantum adiabatic theorem is physically correct.

abstract: A complete set of N+1 mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) forms a convex polytope in the N^2-1 dimensional space of NxN Hermitian matrices of unit trace. As a geometrical object such a polytope exists for all values of N, while it is unknown whether it can be made to lie within the body of density matrices unless N=p^k, where p is prime. We investigate the polytope in order to see if some values of N are geometrically singled out. One such feature is found: It is possible to select N^2 facets in such a way that their centers form a regular simplex if and only if there exists an affine plane of order N. Affine planes of order N are known to exist if N=p^k; perhaps they do not exist otherwise. However, the link to the existence of MUBs--if any--remains to be found.

abstract: The Loschmidt echo (LE) is a measure of the sensitivity of quantum mechanics to perturbations in the evolution operator. It is defined as the overlap of two wave functions evolved from the same initial state but with slightly different Hamiltonians. Thus, it also serves as a quantification of irreversibility in quantum mechanics. In this thesis the LE is studied in systems that have a classical counterpart with dynamical instability, that is, classically chaotic. An analytical treatment that makes use of the semiclassical approximation is presented. It is shown that, under certain regime of the parameters, the LE decays exponentially. Furthermore, for strong enough perturbations, the decay rate is given by the Lyapunov exponent of the classical system. Some particularly interesting examples are given. The analytical results are supported by thorough numerical studies. In addition, some regimes not accessible to the theory are explored, showing that the LE and its Lyapunov regime present the same form of universality ascribed to classical chaos. In a sense, this is evidence that the LE is a robust temporal signature of chaos in the quantum realm. Finally, the relation between the LE and the quantum to classical transition is explored, in particular with the theory of decoherence. Using two different approaches, a semiclassical approximation to Wigner functions and a master equation for the LE, it is shown that the decoherence rate and the decay rate of the LE are equal. The relationship between these quantities results mutually beneficial, in terms of the broader resources of decoherence theory and of the possible experimental realization of the LE.

However, we conclude that the tested inequality is not a genuine Bell's inequality and thus cannot discriminate between quantum mechanics and local realistic approaches.

abstract: We describe a novel protocol for a quantum repeater which enables long distance quantum communication through realistic, lossy photonic channels. Contrary to previous proposals, our protocol incorporates active purification of arbitrary errors at each step of the protocol using only two qubits at each repeater station. Because of these minimal physical requirements, the present protocol can be realized in simple physical systems such as solid-state single photon emitters. As an example, we show how nitrogen vacancy color centers in diamond can be used to implement the protocol, using the nuclear and electronic spin to form the two qubits.

abstract: We propose an entanglement tensor to compute the entanglement of a general pure multipartite quantum state. We compare the ensuing tensor with the concurrence for bipartite state and apply the tensor measure to some interesting examples of entangled three-qubit and four-qubit states. It is shown that in defining the degree of entanglement of a multi-partite state, one needs to make assumptions about the willingness of the parties to cooperate. We also discuss the degree of entanglement of the multi-qubit $\ket{W_{M}}$-states.

abstract: This paper presents a quantum mechanical treatment for both atomic and field fluctuations of an atomic ensemble interacting with propagating fields, either in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency or in a Raman situation. The atomic spin noise spectra and the outgoing field spectra are calculated in both situations. For suitable parameters both EIT and Raman schemes efficiently preserve the quantum state of the incident probe field in the transfer process with the atoms, although a single pass scheme is shown to be intrinsically less efficient than a cavity scheme.

In such systems it is possible to control the `super arrival' time in one of the arms by changing parameters on another, spatially separated from it. This is yet another quantum nonlocal effect. Negative time delays (time advancement) and `ultra Hartman effect' with negative saturation times have been observed in some parameter regimes.

abstract: An algebraic method of constructing potentials for which the Schroedinger equation with position dependent mass can be solved exactly is presented. A general form of the generators of su(1,1) algebra has been employed with a unified approach to the problem. Our systematic approach reproduces a number of earlier results and also leads to some novelties. We show that the solutions of the Schroedinger equation with position dependent mass are free from the choice of parameters for position dependent mass. Two classes of potentials are constructed that include almost all exactly solvable potentials.

abstract: An explicit expression is obtained for the phase-time corresponding to tunneling of a (non-relativistic) particle through two rectangular barriers, both in the case of resonant and in the case of non-resonant tunneling. It is shown that the behavior of the transmission coefficient and of the tunneling phase-time near a resonance is given by expressions with "Breit-Wigner type" denominators. By contrast, it is shown that, when the tunneling probability is low (but not negligible), the non-resonant tunneling time depends on the barrier width and on the distance between the barriers only in a very weak (exponentially decreasing) way: This can imply in various cases, as well-known, the highly Superluminal tunneling associated with the so-called "generalized Hartman Effect"; but we are now able to improve and modify the mathematical description of such an effect, and to compare more in detail our results with the experimental data for non-resonant tunneling of photons. Finally, as a second example, the tunneling phase-time is calculated, and compared with the available experimental results, in the case of the quantum-mechanical tunneling of neutrons through two barrier-filters at the resonance energy of the set-up.

abstract: The intensity of the overlap of a quantum state with all its phase space translations defines its quantum correlations. In the case of pure states, these are invariant with respect to Fourier transformation. The overlaps themselves are here studied in terms of the Wigner function and its Fourier transform, i.e., the characteristic function or chord function. Unlike the Wigner function, the chord function need not be real, but eventual symmetry with respect to reflections about a phase space point may relate these representations. Semiclassical approximations for the "classical-like" region of small chords and for large chords are derived. These lead to an interpretation of the Fourier invariance in terms of conjugate chords. The interrelation of large and small (sub-Planck) phase space structures previously noted in the literature are thus reinterpreted.

It also includes contributions from the potential term, cos(theta)/r^2 (in spherical coordinates). The solutions obtained are for all energies, the discrete (for bound states) as well as the continuous (for scattering states). The L2 bases of the solution space are chosen such that the matrix representation of the wave operator is tridiagonal. The expansion coefficients of the radial and angular components of the wavefunction are written in terms of orthogonal polynomials satisfying three-term recursion relations resulting from the matrix wave equation.

abstract: We study in detail the interesting dynamical symmetry and its applications in various atomic systems with electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in this paper. By discovering the symmetrical Lie group of various atomic systems, such as single-atomic-ensemble composed of complex $m$-level $(m>3)$ atoms, and $two$-atomic-ensemble and even multi-atomic-ensemble system composed of of $three$-level atoms etc., one can obtain the general definition of dark-state polaritons (DSPs), and then the dark-states of these different systems. The symmetrical properties of the multi-level system and multi-atomic-ensemble system are shown to be dependent on some characteristic parameters of the EIT system. Furthermore, a controllable scheme to generate quantum entanglement between lights or atoms via quantized DSPs theory is discussed and the robustness of this scheme is analyzed by confirming the validity of adiabatic passage conditions in this paper.

abstract: We propose a new method of spin squeezing of atomic spin, based on the interactions between atoms and off-resonant light which are known as paramagnetic Faraday rotation and fictitious magnetic field of light. Since the projection process, squeezed light, or special interactions among the atoms are not required in this method, it can be widely applied to many systems. The attainable range of the squeezing parameter is S^{-2/5}, where S is the total spin, which is limited by additional fluctuations imposed by coherent light and the spherical nature of the spin distribution.

abstract: We investigate the possibility of implementing a given projection measurement using linear optics and arbitrarily fast feedforward based on the continuous detection of photons. In particular, we systematically derive the so-called Dolinar scheme that achieves the minimum error discrimination of binary coherent states. Moreover, we show that the Dolinar-type approach can also be applied to projection measurements in the regime of photonic-qubit signals. Our results demonstrate that for implementing a projection measurement with linear optics, in principle, unit success probability may be approached even without the use of expensive entangled auxiliary states, as they are needed in all known (near-)deterministic linear-optics proposals.

comments: 20 pages

abstract: The Feynman-Kac path integration problem was studied in the worst case setting by Plaskota et al. (J. Comp. Phys. 164 (2000) 335) for the univariate case and by Kwas and Li (J. Comp. 19 (2003) 730) for the multivariate case with d space variables. In this paper we consider the multivariate Feynman-Kac path integration problem in the randomized and quantum settings. For smooth multivariate functions, it was proven in Kwas and Li (2003) that the classical worst case complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality in d. We show that in both the randomized and quantum settings the curse of dimensionality is vanquished, i.e., the number of function evaluations and/or quantum queries required to compute an e-approximation has a bound independent of d and depending polynomially on 1/e. The exponents of these polynomials are at most 2 in the randomized setting and at most 1 in the quantum setting. Hence we have exponential speedup over the classical worst case setting and quadratic speedup of the quantum setting over the randomized setting. However, both the randomized and quantum algorithms presented here still require extensive precomputing, similar to the algorithms of Plaskota et al. (2000) and Kwas and Li(2003).

abstract: We develop a comprehensive theory of phase for finite-dimensional quantum systems. The only physical requirement we impose is that phase is complementary to amplitude. To implement this complementarity we use the notion of mutually unbiased bases, which exist for dimensions that are powers of a prime. For a d-dimensional system (qudit) we explicitly construct d+1 classes of maximally commuting operators, each one consisting of d-1 operators. One of this class consists of diagonal operators that represent amplitudes (or inversions). By the finite Fourier transform, it is mapped onto ladder operators that can be appropriately interpreted as phase variables. We discuss the examples of qubits and qutrits, and show how these results generalize previous approaches.

abstract: We present detailed numerical calculations of the mechanical torque induced by quantum fluctuations on two parallel birefringent plates with in plane optical anisotropy, separated by either vacuum or a liquid (ethanol). The torque is found to vary as $\sin(2\theta)$, where $\theta$ represents the angle between the two optical axes, and its magnitude rapidly increases with decreasing plate separation $d$. For a 40 $\mu$m diameter disk, made out of either quartz or calcite, kept parallel to a Barium Titanate plate at $d\simeq 100$ nm, the maximum torque (at $\theta={\pi\over 4}$) is of the order of $\simeq 10^{-19}$ N$\cdot$m. We propose an experiment to observe this torque when the Barium Titanate plate is immersed in ethanol and the other birefringent disk is placed on top of it. In this case the retarded van der Waals (or Casimir-Lifshitz) force between the two birefringent slabs is repulsive. The disk would float parallel to the plate at a distance where its net weight is counterbalanced by the retarded van der Waals repulsion, free to rotate in response to very small driving torques.

abstract: The paper discusses the single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model with time dependent parameters. Solvable models for two-level systems are utilized to consider the changes in the photon distribution affected by the passage of atoms through the cavity. It is suggested that such systems may be used as filters to modify the photon distribution. The effect can be enhanced by repeatedly sending new atoms through the cavity. We show that such filters can cut out either small or large photon numbers. It is also shown that the method can be used to narrow down photon distributions and in this way achieve highly non-classical sub-Poissonian states. Some limitations and applications of the method are presented.

abstract: We demonstrate that the magnetic susceptibility of strongly alternating antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains is an entanglement witness. Specifically, magnetic susceptibility of copper nitrate (CN) measured in 1963 (Berger et al., Phys. Rev. 132, 1057 (1963)) cannot be described without presence of entanglement. A detailed analysis of the spin correlations in CN as obtained from neutron scattering experiments (Xu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 4465 (2000)) provides microscopic support for this interpretation. We present a quantitative analysis resulting in the critical temperature of 5K in both, completely independent, experiments below which entanglement exists.

We apply our method to an example involving n parties sharing a GHZ-type state on which they carry out measurements and show that for local-hidden variable theories, the amount of super-luminal classical communication c and the detector efficiency eta are constrained by eta 2^(-c/n) = O(n^(-1/6)) even for constant general error probability epsilon = O(1).

abstract: This letter presents a two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) approach for constructing a two-logical-qubit decoherence-free subspace (DFS) based on the fact that the three protons in a CH3 spin system can not be resolved in one-dimension NMR spectroscopy, but to a certain extent, can be distinguished by two-dimensional multiple-quantum NMR. We used four noisy physical nuclear spins, including three protons and one carbon in the CH3 spin system, to generate two decoherence-free logical quantum bits. It made full use of the unaddressed spins which could not be used in one-dimensional spectrum. Furthermore, we have experimentally demonstrated such an approach. Our experimental results have shown that our DFS can protect against far more types of decoherence than the one composed of four noisy physical qubits all with different chemical shifts. More importantly, this idea may provide new insights into extending qubit systems in the sense that it effectively utilizes the magnetically equivalent nuclei.

These approaches rely on and indicate that Quantum Mechanics seems to support some infinite variant of classical parallel computing. We compare this new one with other attempts towards hypercomputation by separating 1) its principal computing capabilities from 2) realizability issues. The first are shown to coincide with recursive enumerability; the second are considered in analogy to `existence' in mathematical logic.

Our results show that the experimental simulation can give the spectrum of the simulated Hamiltonian. Consequently, the potential power of a quantum computer on the simulation of complex physical systems is verified.

abstract: We investigate how decoherence affects the short-time separation between quantum and classical dynamics for classically chaotic systems, within the framework of a specific model. For a wide range of parameters, the distance between the corresponding phase-space distributions depends on a single parameter $\chi$ that relates an effective Planck constant $\hbar_{\rm eff}$, the Lyapunov coeffficient, and the diffusion constant. This distance peaks at a time that depends logarithmically on $\hbar_{\rm eff}$, in agreement with previous estimations of the separation time for Hamiltonian systems. However, for $\chi\lesssim 1$, the separation remains small, going down with $\hbar_{\rm eff}^2$, so the concept of separation time loses its meaning.

abstract: We extend the definition of concurrence into a family of entanglement monotones, which we call concurrence monotones. We discuss their properties and advantages as computational manageable measures of entanglement, and show that for pure bipartite states all measures of entanglement can be written as functions of the concurrence monotones. We then show that the concurrence monotones provide bounds on quantum information tasks. As an example, we discuss their applications to remote entanglement distributions (RED) such as entanglement swapping and remote preparation of bipartite entangled states (RPBES). We prove a powerful theorem which states what kind of (possibly mixed) bipartite states or distributions of bipartite states can not be remotely prepared. The theorem establishes an upper bound on the amount of $G$-concurrence (one member in the concurrence family) that can be created between two single-qudit nodes of quantum networks by means of tripartite RED. For pure bipartite states the bound on the $G$-concurrence can always be saturated by RPBES.

When the initial phonon number of the NAMR is not too large, this cooling protocol is efficient in decreasing the phonon number by two to three orders of magnitude. Our proposal is theoretically universal in cooling various boson systems of single mode. It can be specifically generalized to prepare the nonclassical state of the NAMR.

abstract: Using electrostatic gates to control the electron positions, we present a new controlled-NOT gate based on quantum dots. The qubit states are chosen to be the spin states of an excess conductor electron in the quantum dot; and the main ingredients of our scheme are the superpositions of space-time paths of electrons and the effect of Coulomb blockade. All operations are performed only on individual quantum dots and are based on fundamental interactions. Without resorting to spin-spin terms or other assumed interactions, the scheme can be realized with a dedicated circuit and a necessary number of quantum dots. Gate fidelity of the quantum computation is also presented.

abstract: In the spirit of some earlier work on the construction of vector coherent states over matrix domains, we compute here such states associated to some physical Hamiltonians. In particular, we construct vector coherent states of the Gazeau-Klauder type. As a related problem, we also suggest a way to handle degeneracies in the Hamiltonian for building coherent states. Specific physical Hamiltonians studied include a single photon mode interacting with a pair of fermions, a Hamiltonian involving a single boson and a single fermion, a charged particle in a three dimensional harmonic force field and the case of a two-dimensional electron placed in a constant magnetic field, orthogonal to the plane which contains the electron. In this last example, an interesting modular structure emerges for two underlying von Neumann algebras, related to opposite directions of the magnetic field. This leads to the existence of coherent states built out of KMS states for the system.

abstract: We elaborate on a model of quantum random walk proposed by Hillery et. al., and Jeong et. al., which uses the multiports for quantum "coin tossing". The dynamics of this model is analyzed for the case when the multiports are arranged on the hypercube. If the hypercube is attached to semi-infinite lines, then it can act as a scattering potential, which can be reduced to a quantum walk on the line with non-unitary evolution. We also show how this model can be implemented using simple quantum gates.

abstract: A complete set of d+1 mutually unbiased bases exists in a Hilbert spaces of dimension d, whenever d is a power of a prime. We discuss a simple construction of d+1 disjoint classes (each one having d-1 commuting operators) such that the corresponding eigenstates form sets of unbiased bases. Such a construction works properly for prime dimension. We investigate an alternative construction in which the real numbers that label the classes are replaced by a finite field having d elements. One of these classes is diagonal, and can be mapped to cyclic operators by means of the finite Fourier transform, which allows one to understand complementarity in a similar way as for the position-momentum pair in standard quantum mechanics. The relevant examples of two and three qubits and two qutrits are discussed in detail.

abstract: Based on a discussion of the theory experiment connection, it is proposed to tighten the connection by replacing the real and complex number basis of physical theories by sets R_{n},C_{n} of length 2n finite binary string numbers. The form of the numbers in R_{n} is based on the infinite hierarchy of 2n figure outputs from measurements of any physical quantity with an infinite range (distance, energy, etc.). A space and time based on these numbers is described. It corresponds to an infinite sequence of spherical scale sections R_{n,e} (e an integer). Each section has the same number of points but the size increases exponentially with increasing e. The sections converge towards an origin which is a space singularity. Iteration of an order preserving transformation, F_{<} or its inverse shows exponential expansion or contraction of the space with the origin as a source or sink of space points. The suitability of R_{n} space as a framework for inflationary cosmology is based on a constant iteration rate for F_{<} and time dependent e and n=n(t). At t=0 all space is restricted to a region of scale sections R_{n_{0},e} with n_{0} (small) and e\leq e_{0} (negative). Inflation, which occurs naturally, is stopped automatically at time t_{I} by increasing n from n_{0} to n_{I}>>n_{0}. Here n_{I} is such that the outermost \Delta scale sections of R_{n_{0}} space, which are moving at velocities >c at time t_{I}, are contained in the scale section R_{n_{I},0} of R_{n_{I}} space. This is needed if R_{n_{I},0} space is to be similar to the usual R space. Hubble expansion and the redshift are accounted for by a continuing slow increase in n. Comparison with experimental data suggests that the rate of increase must be at least one n unit every 30-60 million years.

abstract: We show that the recently demonstrated technique for generating stationary pulses of light [Nature {\bf 426}, 638 (2003)] can be extended to localize optical pulses in all three spatial dimensions in a resonant atomic medium. This method can be used to dramatically enhance the nonlinear interaction between weak optical pulses. In particular, we show that an efficient Kerr-like interaction between two pulses can be implemented as a sequence of several purely linear optical processes. The resulting process may enable coherent interactions between single photon pulses.

A striking contradiction is created between the predictions of quantum mechanics and local hidden variable based theories. The contradiction relies on non-maximally entangled position states of two particles.

In order to illustrate our approach we analyze in detail how a process of an exponential decay and a process of decoherence can be derived from a collision-like model in which particular collisions are described by SWAP and controlled-NOT interactions, respectively.

Two stabilizer states are called LC equivalent if there exists a local Clifford operation which maps the first state to the second. We present a finite set of invariants which completely characterizes the LC equivalence class of any stabilizer state. Our invariants have simple descriptions within the binary framework in which stabilizer states are usually described.

We relate entanglement distance to degeneracy pressure both for extreme relativistic and non-relativistic systems, and estimate the entanglement distance in a white dwarf. Treating entanglement as a thermodynamical quantity, we relate the entropy of formation and concurrence to relative electron distance, pressure, and temperature, to form a new equation of state for entanglement.

abstract: A universal programmable detector is a device that can be tuned to perform any desired measurement on a given quantum system, by changing the state of an ancilla. With a finite dimension d for the ancilla only approximate universal programmability is possible, with "size" d=f(1/e) increasing function of the "accuracy" 1/e. In this letter we show that, much better than the exponential size known in the literature, one can achieve polynomial size. An explicit example with linear size is also presented. Finally, we show that for covariant measurements exact programmability is feasible.

abstract: We propose and study a method for using non-maximally entangled states to implement probabilistically non-local gates. Unlike distillation-based protocols, this method does not generate a maximally entangled state at intermediate stages of the process. As a consequences, the method becomes more efficient at a certain range of parameters. Gates of the form $\exp[i\xi\sigma_{n_A}\sigma_{n_B}]$ with $\xi\ll1$, can be implemented with nearly unit probability and with vanishingly small entanglement, while for the distillation-based method the gate is produced with a vanishing success probability. We also derive an upper bound to the optimal success probability and show that in the small entanglement limit, the bound is tight.

abstract: Two observers determine the entanglement between two free bosonic modes by each detecting one of the modes and observing the correlations between their measurements. We show that a state which is maximally entangled in an inertial frame becomes less entangled if the observers are relatively accelerated. This phenomenon, which is a consequence of the Unruh effect, shows that entanglement is an observer-dependent quantity in non-inertial frames. In the high acceleration limit, our results can be applied to a non-accelerated observer falling into a black hole while the accelerated one barely escapes. If the observer escapes with infinite acceleration, the state's distillable entanglement vanishes.

We also show that these two methods lead to the same solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation.

So the extra symmetry (S(2))in the quantum Kepler problem, which determines the degeneracy of the levels, is so robust as to accommodate the relativistic case in arbitrary dimensions.

Under a quite general hypothesis on the interaction Hamiltonian of the qubits a theorem is proved which shows that the receiver is able to asymptotically recover the messages by repetitive monitoring of his qubits.

Cold atoms are confined by optical dipole forces at the antinodes of a standing wave generated by the two counter-propagating modes of a laser-driven high-finesse ring cavity. By heterodyning the Bragg-scattered light with a reference beam, we obtain detailed information on phase shifts imparted by the Bragg scattering process. Being deep in the Lamb-Dicke regime, the scattered light is not broadened by the motion of individual atoms. In contrast, we have detected signatures of global translatory motion of the atomic grating.

abstract: We study a continuous-variable (CV) teleportation protocol based on a shared entangled state produced by the quantum-nondemolition (QND) interaction of two vacuum states. The scheme utilizes the QND interaction or an unbalanced beam splitter in the Bell measurement. It is shown that in the non-unity gain regime the signal transfer coefficient can be enhanced while the conditional variance product remains preserved by applying appropriate local squeezing operation on sender's part of the shared entangled state. In the unity gain regime it is demonstrated that the fidelity of teleportation can be increased with the help of the local squeezing operations on parts of the shared entangled state that convert effectively our scheme to the standard CV teleportation scheme. Further, it is proved analytically that such a choice of the local symplectic operations minimizes the noise by which the mean number of photons in the input state is increased during the teleportation. Finally, our analysis reveals that the local symplectic operation on sender's side can be integrated into the Bell measurement if the interaction constant of the interaction in the Bell measurement can be adjusted properly.

abstract: Quantum computers require technologies that offer both sufficient control over coherent quantum phenomena and minimal spurious interactions with the environment. We show, that photons confined to photonic crystals, and in particular to highly efficient waveguides formed from linear chains of defects doped with atoms can generate strong non-linear interactions which allow to implement both single and two qubit quantum gates. The simplicity of the gate switching mechanism, the experimental feasibility of fabricating two dimensional photonic crystal structures and integrability of this device with optoelectronics offers new interesting possibilities for optical quantum information processing networks.

abstract: We revisit the protocols to create maximally entangled states between two Josephson junction (JJ) charge phase qubits coupled to a microwave field in a cavity as a quantum data bus. We devote to analyze a novel mechanism of quantum decoherence due to the adiabatic entanglement between qubits and the data bus, the off-resonance microwave field. We show that even through the variable of the data bus can be adiabatically eliminated, the entanglement between the qubits and data bus remains and can decoher the superposition of two-particle state. Fortunately we can construct a decoherence-free subspace of two-dimension to against this adiabatic decoherence.To carry out the analytic study for this decoherence problem, we develop Fr\H{o}hlich transformation to re-derive the effective Hamiltonian of these system, which is equivalent to that obtained from the adiabatic elimination approach .

abstract: It is argued that local realism is a fundamental principle, which might be rejected only if experiments clearly show that it is untenable. A critical review is presented of the derivations of Bell's inequalities and the performed experiments, with the conclusion that no valid, loophole-free, test exists of local realism vs. quantum mechanics. It is pointed out that, without any essential modification, quantum mechanics might be compatible with local realism. This suggests that the principle may be respected by nature.

abstract: We address nonlocality of a class of fully inseparable three-mode Gaussian states generated either by bilinear three-mode Hamiltonians or by a sequence of bilinear two-mode Hamiltonians. Two different tests revealing strong nonlocality are considered, in which the dichotomic Bell operator is represented by displaced parity and by pseudospin operator respectively. Three-mode states are also considered as a conditional source of two-mode non Gaussian states, whose nonlocal properties are analyzed. We found that the non Gaussian character of the conditional states allows violation of Bell's inequalities (by parity and pseudospin tests) stronger than with a conventional twin-beam state. However, the non Gaussian character is not sufficient to reveal nonlocality thorough a dichotomized quadrature measurement strategy.

abstract: We study the spectrum in such a PT-symmetric square well of a diameter L where the "strength of the non-Hermiticity" is controlled by the two parameters, viz., by an imaginary coupling ig and by the distance d of its onset from the origin. We solve this problem and confirm that the spectrum is discrete and real in a non-empty interval of g. Surprisingly, a specific distinction between the bound states is found in their asymptotic stability/instability with respect to an unlimited growth of g. In our model, all of the low-lying levels remain asymptotically unstable at the small d and finite L while only the stable levels survive for d near L or in the purely imaginary well with infinite L. In between these two extremes, an unusual and tunable, variable pattern of the interspersed "robust" and "fragile" subspectra of the real levels is obtained.

abstract: We discuss a novel form of the variational approach in Quantum Field Theory in which the trial quantum configuration is represented directly in terms of relevant expectation values rather than, e.g., increasingly complicated structure from Fock space. The quantum algebra imposes constraints on such expectation values so that the variational problem is formulated here as an optimization under constraints. As an example of application of such approach we consider the study of ground state and critical properties in a variant of nonlinear sigma model.

abstract: We report on the implementation of Burgers equation as a type-II quantum computation on an NMR quantum information processor. Since the flow field evolving under the Burgers equation develops sharp features over time, this is a better test of liquid state NMR implementations of type-II quantum computers than the previous examples using the diffusion equation. In particular, we show that Fourier approximations used in the encoding step are not the dominant error. Small systematic errors in the collision operator accumulate and swamp all other errors. We propose, and demonstrate, that the accumulation of this error can be avoided to a large extent by replacing the single collision operator with a set of operators with random errors and similar fidelities. Experiments have been implemented on 16 two-qubit sites for eight successive time steps for the Burgers equation.

abstract: In theory, quantum computers can efficiently simulate quantum physics, factor large numbers and estimate integrals, thus solving otherwise intractable computational problems. In practice, quantum computers must operate with noisy devices called ``gates'' that tend to destroy the fragile quantum states needed for computation. The goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing is to compute accurately even when gates have a high probability of error each time they are used. Here we give evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible with error probabilities above 3% per gate, which is significantly higher than what was previously thought possible. However, the resources required for computing at such high error probabilities are excessive. Fortunately, they decrease rapidly with decreasing error probabilities. If we had quantum resources comparable to the considerable resources available in today's digital computers, we could implement non-trivial quantum computations at error probabilities as high as 1% per gate.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410201
abstract: In this paper we point out that the Jaynes-Cummings model without taking a renonance conditon gives a non-commutative version of the simple spin model (including the parameters $x$, $y$ and $z$) treated by M. V. Berry. This model is different from usual non-commutative ones because the x-y coordinates are quantized, while the z coordinate is not. One of new and interesting points in our non-commutative model is that the strings corresponding to Dirac ones in the Berry model exist only in states containing the ground state (${\cal F}\times \{\ket{0}\} \cup \{\ket{0}\}\times {\cal F}$), while for other excited states (${\cal F}\times {\cal F} \setminus {\cal F}\times \{\ket{0}\} \cup \{\ket{0}\}\times {\cal F}$) they don't exist. It is probable that a non-commutative model makes singular objects (singular points or singular lines or etc) in the corresponding classical model mild or removes them partly.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410202
abstract: Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, various classical systems differing only on the scale smaller than Planck's cell correspond to the same quantum system. This fact is used to find a unique semiclassical representation without the Van Vleck determinant, applicable to a large class of correlation functions expressible as quantum fidelity. As in the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, all contributing trajectories have the same amplitude: that is why it is denoted the ``dephasing representation.'' By relating the present approach to the problem of existence of true trajectories near numerically-computed chaotic trajectories, the approximation is made rigorous for any system in which the shadowing theorem holds. Numerical implementation only requires computing actions along the unperturbed trajectories and not finding the shadowing trajectories. While semiclassical linear-response theory was used before in quasi-integrable and chaotic systems, here its validity is justified in the most generic, mixed systems. Dephasing representation appears to be a rare practical method to calculate quantum correlation functions in nonuniversal regimes in many-dimensional systems where exact quantum calculations are impossible.

A \textbf{68}, 042319 (2003)] using sophisticated but not unrealistic quantum states. The major resource required in these gates are state diagonal to the basis states. We use the recent observation that a squeezed single photon state ($\hat{S}(r) \ket{1}$) approximates well an odd superposition of coherent states ($\ket{\alpha} - \ket{-\alpha}$) to address the diagonal resource problem. The approximation only holds for relatively small $\alpha$ and hence these gates cannot be used in a scaleable scheme. We explore the effects on fidelities and probabilities in teleportation and a rotated Hadamard gate.

abstract: A direct derivation is given for the optimal mean fidelity of quantum state estimation of a d-dimensional unknown pure state with its N copies given as input, which was first obtained by M. Hayashi in terms of an infinite set of covariant positive operator valued measures (POVM's) and by Bruss and Macchiavello establishing a connection to optimal quantum cloning. An explicit condition for POVM measurement operators for optimal estimators is obtained, by which we construct optimal estimators with finite POVM using exact quadratures on a hypersphere. These finite optimal estimators are not generally universal, where universality means the fidelity is independent of input states. However, any optimal estimator with finite POVM for M(>N) copies is universal if it is used for N copies as input.

abstract: Canonical transformations are defined and discussed along with the exponential, the coherent and the ultracoherent vectors. It is shown that the single-mode and the $n$-mode squeezing operators are elements of the group of canonical transformations. An application of canonical transformations is made, in the context of open quantum systems, by studying the effect of squeezing of the bath on the decoherence properties of the system. Two cases are analyzed. In the first case the bath consists of a massless bosonic field with the bath reference states being the squeezed vacuum states and squeezed thermal states while in the second case a system consisting of a harmonic oscillator interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators is analyzed with the bath being initially in a squeezed thermal state.

Our work is motivated by an analogy of Schrodinger's cat paradox, where the state corresponding to the virtual cat is a mixed thermal state with a large average photon number. Remarkably, quantum entanglement can be produced between thermal states with nearly the maximum Bell-inequality violation even when the temperatures of both modes approach infinity.

abstract: In this paper we present an approach to quantum cloning with unmodulated spin networks. The cloner is realized by a proper design of the network and a choice of the coupling between the qubits. We show that in the case of phase covariant cloner the XY coupling gives the best results. In the 1->2 cloning we find that the value for the fidelity of the optimal cloner is achieved, and values comparable to the optimal ones in the general N->M case can be attained. If a suitable set of network symmetries are satisfied, the output fidelity of the clones does not depend on the specific choice of the graph. We show that spin network cloning is robust against the presence of static imperfections. Moreover, in the presence of noise, it outperforms the conventional approach. In this case the fidelity exceeds the corresponding value obtained by quantum gates even for a very small amount of noise. Furthermore we show how to use this method to clone qutrits and qudits. By means of the Heisenberg coupling it is also possible to implement the universal cloner although in this case the fidelity is 10% off that of the optimal cloner.

abstract: We present a quantum theory of nondegenerate phase-sensitive parametric amplification in a chi^3 nonlinear medium. The non-zero response time of the Kerr chi^3 nonlinearity determines the quantum-limited noise figure of chi^3 parametric amplification, as well as the limit on quadrature squeezing. This non-zero response time of the nonlinearity requires coupling of the parametric process to a molecular-vibration phonon bath, causing the addition of excess noise through spontaneous Raman scattering. We present analytical expressions for the quantum-limited noise figure of frequency non-degenerate and frequency degenerate chi^3 parametric amplifiers operated as phase-sensitive amplifiers. We also present results for frequency non-degenerate quadrature squeezing. We show that our non-degenerate squeezing theory agrees with the degenerate squeezing theory of Boivin and Shapiro as degeneracy is approached. We have also included the effect of linear loss on the phase-sensitive process.

We show that full security can be proven by considering only collective attacks. We derive computable lower and upper bounds on the secret key rate of those QKD protocol involving only entropies of two--qubit density operators. As an illustration of our results, we determine new bounds for the BB84, the six-state, and the B92 protocol. We show that in all these cases the first classical processing that the legitimate partners should apply consists in adding noise. This is precisely why any entanglement based proof would generally fail here.

abstract: The study of entangled states has greatly improved the basic understanding about two-photon interferometry. Two-photon interference is not the interference of two photons but the result of superposition among indistinguishable two-photon amplitudes. The concept of two-photon amplitude, however, has generally been restricted to the case of entangled photons. In this letter we report an experimental study that may extend this concept to the general case of independent photons. The experiment also shows interesting practical applications regarding the possibility of obtaining high resolution interference patterns with thermal sources.

abstract: We investigate the suitability of toroidal microcavities for strong-coupling cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). Numerical modeling of the optical modes demonstrate a significant reduction of modal volume with respect to the whispering gallery modes of dielectric spheres, while retaining the high quality factors representative of spherical cavities. The extra degree of freedom of toroid microcavities can be used to achieve improved cavity QED characteristics. Numerical results for atom-cavity coupling strength, critical atom number N_0 and critical photon number n_0 for cesium are calculated and shown to exceed values currently possible using Fabry-Perot cavities. Modeling predicts coupling rates g/(2*pi) exceeding 700 MHz and critical atom numbers approaching 10^{-7} in optimized structures. Furthermore, preliminary experimental measurements of toroidal cavities at a wavelength of 852 nm indicate that quality factors in excess of 100 million can be obtained in a 50 micron principal diameter cavity, which would result in strong coupling values of (g/(2*pi),n_0,N_0)=(86 MHz,4.6*10^{-4},1.0*10^{-3}).

Here we show how such a measurement can indeed be made using resonant atomic probes, via detection of incoherent fluorescence induced by a laser beam. This measurement is possible due to self-interference effects between the positive and negative frequency components of the field. In effect, the small cluster of atoms here act as a highly localized pick-up coil, and the fluorescence channel acts as a transmission line.

abstract: We study a model of spontaneous wavefunction collapse for a free quantum particle. We analyze in detail the time evolution of the single-Gaussian solution and the double-Gaussian solution, showing how the reduction mechanism induces the localization of the wavefunction in space; we also study the asymptotic behavior of the general solution. With an appropriate choice for the parameter $\lambda$ which sets the strength of the collapse mechanism, we prove that: i) the effects of the reducing terms on the dynamics of microscopic systems are negligible, the physical predictions of the model being very close to those of standard quantum mechanics; ii) at the macroscopic scale, the model reproduces classical mechanics: the wavefunction of the center of mass of a macro-object behaves, with high accuracy, like a point moving in space according to Newton's laws.

title: Matter diffraction at oblique incidence: Higher resolution and the Helium Trimer Efimov state

abstract: We study the diffraction of atoms and weakly-bound three-atomic molecules from a transmission grating at non-normal incidence. Due to the thickness of the grating bars the slits are partially shadowed. Therefore, the projected slit width decreases more strongly with the angle of incidence than the projected period, increasing, in principle, the experimental resolution. The shadowing, however, requires a revision of the theory of atom diffraction. We derive an expression in the style of the Kirchhoff integral of optics and show that the diffraction pattern exhibits a characteristic asymmetry which must be accounted for when comparing with experimental data. We then analyze the diffraction of weakly bound trimers and show that their finite size manifests itself in a further reduction of the slit width by (3/4)<r> where <r> is the average bond length. The improved resolution at non-normal incidence may in particular allow to discern, by means of their bond lengths, between the small ground state of the helium trimer (<r>=1 nm, Barletta and Kievsky, Phys. Rev. A 64, 042514 (2001)) and its predicted Efimov-type excited state (<r>=8 nm, ibid.), and in this way to experimentally prove the existence of this long-sought Efimov state.

abstract: We report the successful generation of an entangled multiparticle quantum superposition of pure photon states. They result from a multiple (universal} cloning of a single photon qubit by a high gain, quantum-injected parametric amplifier. The information preserving property of the process suggests for these states the name of ''multi-particle qubits''. They are ideal objects for investigating the emergence of the classical world in quantum systems with increasing complexity, the decoherence processes and may allow the practical implementation of the universal 2-qubit logic gates.

It involves combinatorial polynomials in the number operator N for which the generating functions and explicit expressions are found. Simple deformations provide examples of the method.

abstract: We study the problem of discriminating between non-orthogonal quantum states with least probability of error. We demonstrate that this problem can be simplified if we solve for the error itself rather than solving directly for the optimal measurement. This method enables us to derive solutions directly and thus make definite statements about the uniqueness of an optimal strategy. This approach immediately leads us to a state-discrimination analogue of Davies Theorem. In the course of this, a complete solution for distinguishing equally likely pure qubit states is presented.

We show that, conditioned on the outcomes of an informationally complete measurement applied to a number of subsystems, the state in the remaining subsystems is close to having product form. This immediately generalizes the so-called de Finetti representation to the case of finite symmetric quantum states.

abstract: I argue that the linearity of quantum mechanics is an emergent feature at the Planck scale, along with the manifold structure of space-time. In this regime the usual causality violation objections to nonlinearity do not apply, and nonlinear effects can be of comparable magnitude to the linear ones and still be highly suppressed at low energies. This can offer alternative approaches to quantum gravity and to the evolution of the early universe.

abstract: The temperature dependence of the Casimir force between a real metallic plate and a metallic sphere is analyzed on the basis of optical data concerning the dispersion relation of metals such as gold and copper. Realistic permittivities imply, together with basic thermodynamic considerations, that the transverse electric zero mode does not contribute. This results in observable differences with the conventional prediction, which does not take this physical requirement into account. The results are shown to be consistent with the third law of thermodynamics, as well as being consistent with current experiments. However, the predicted temperature dependence should be detectable in future experiments. The inadequacies of approaches based on {\it ad hoc} assumptions, such as the plasma dispersion relation and the use of surface impedance without transverse momentum dependence, are discussed.

We prove that shared entanglement permits 100% reliable quantum fingerprinting, which will outperform classical fingerprinting even with arbitrary amounts of shared randomness.

abstract: We propose an experimentally relevant scheme to create stable solitons in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a one-dimensional optical lattice, using temporal modulation of the scattering length (through ac magnetic field tuned close to the Feshbach resonance). Another physical interpretation is a possibility to create stable 3D "light bullets" in an optical medium with a longitudinal alternating self-focusing/defocusing structure, and periodic modulation of the refractive index in a transverse direction. We develop a variational approximation to identify a stability region in the parametric space, and verify the existence of stable breathing solitons in direct simulations. Both methods reveal that stable solitons may be supported if the average value of the nonlinear coefficient (whose sign corresponds to attraction between atoms) and the lattice's strength exceed well-defined minimum values. Stable localized patterns may feature a multi-cell structure.

abstract: Paralleling our recent computationally-intensive (quasi-Monte Carlo) work for the case N=4 (quant-ph/0308037), we undertake the task for N=6 of computing to high numerical accuracy, the formulas of Sommers and Zyczkowski (quant-ph/0304041) for the (N^2-1)-dimensional volume and (N^2-2)-dimensional hyperarea of the (separable and nonseparable) N x N density matrices, based on the Bures (minimal monotone) metric -- and also their analogous formulas (quant-ph/0302197) for the (non-monotone) Hilbert-Schmidt metric. With the same seven billion well-distributed (``low-discrepancy'') sample points, we estimate the unknown volumes and hyperareas based on five additional (monotone) metrics of interest, including the Kubo-Mori and Wigner-Yanase. Further, we estimate all of these seven volume and seven hyperarea (unknown) quantities when restricted to the separable density matrices. The ratios of separable volumes (hyperareas) to separable plus nonseparable volumes (hyperareas) yield estimates of the separability probabilities of generically rank-six (rank-five) density matrices. The (rank-six) separability probabilities obtained based on the 35-dimensional volumes appear to be -- independently of the metric (each of the seven inducing Haar measure) employed -- twice as large as those (rank-five ones) based on the 34-dimensional hyperareas. Accepting such a relationship, we fit exact formulas to the estimates of the Bures and Hilbert-Schmidt separable volumes and hyperareas.(An additional estimate -- 33.9982 -- of the ratio of the rank-6 Hilbert-Schmidt separability probability to the rank-4 one is quite clearly close to integral too.) The doubling relationship also appears to hold for the N=4 case for the Hilbert-Schmidt metric, but not the others. We fit exact formulas for the Hilbert-Schmidt separable volumes and hyperareas.

abstract: The phenomenological description of propagation of atomic matter waves inside a curved atom wave guide is presented based on the effective action principle. The evolutions in both temporal and spatial domains for the atomic matter wave in the presence of guiding potential fields (classical and quantized) are considered. The coherent control of three-level atomic matter waves in a wave guide by an external controlling light is briefly discussed. The concepts of {\it atomic matter-wave bandgap structure} in a spatially periodic guiding field ({\it e.g.}, the interior potential of carbon peapod which can trap both atoms and light) and {\it optical lattice bandgap medium} are suggested.

abstract: Continuous time quantum walks (CTQW) do not necessarily perform better than their classical counterparts, the continuous time random walks (CTRW). For one special graph, where a recent analysis showed that in a particular direction of propagation the penetration of the graph is faster by CTQWs than by CTRWs, we demonstrate that in another direction of propagation the opposite is true; In this case a CTQW initially localized at one site displays a slow transport. We furthermore show that when the CTQW's initial condition is a totally symmetric superposition of states of equivalent sites, the transport gets to be much more rapid.

This gate was capable of distinguishing between all of the Bell states with higher than 75% fidelity without any noise substraction due to utilizing quantum interference effects.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0410245
abstract: Mathematical foundation of the novel concept of quantum tensor product by Zanardi et al is rigorously established. The concept of relative quantum entanglement is naturally introduced and its meaning is made clear both mathematically and physically. For a finite or an infinite dimensional vector space $W$ the so called tensor product partition (TPP) is introduced on $End(W)$, the set of endmorphisms of $W$, and a natural correspondence is constructed between the set of TPP's of $End(W)$ and the set of tensor product structures (TPS's) of $W$. As a byproduct, it is shown that an arbitrarily given wave function belonging to an n-dimensional Hilbert space, $n$ being not a prime number, can be interpreted as a separable state with respect to some man-made TPS, and thus a quantum entangled state of a many-body system with respect to the "God-given" TPS can be regarded as a quantum state without entanglement in some sense. The concept of standard set of observables is also introduced to probe the underlying structure of the object TPP and to establish its connection with practical physical measurement.

abstract: We study the relation between entanglement and quantum chaos in one- and two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice models, which exhibit mixing of the noninteracting eigenfunctions and transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Contrary to what occurs in a quantum phase transition, the onset of quantum chaos is not a property of the ground state but take place for any typical many-spin quantum state. We study bipartite and pairwise entanglement measures, namely the reduced Von Neumann entropy and the concurrence, and discuss quantum entanglement sharing. Our results suggest that the behavior of the entanglement is related to the mixing of the eigenfunctions rather than to the transition to chaos.

abstract: To world-wide notice, in 2002 the ATHENA collaboration at CERN (in Geneva, Switzerland) announced the creation of order 100,000 low energy antihydrogen atoms. Thus, the concept of using condensed antihydrogen as a low-weight, powerful fuel (i.e., it produces a thousand times more energy per unit weight of fuel than fission/fusion) for very deep space missions (the Oort cloud and beyond) had reached the realm of conceivability. We briefly discuss the history of antimatter research and focus on the technologies that must be developed to allow a future use of controlled, condensed antihydrogen for propulsion purposes. We emphasize that a dedicated antiproton source (the main barrier to copious antihydrogen production) must be built in the US, perhaps as a joint NASA/DOE/NIH project. This is because the only practical sources in the world are at CERN and the proposed facility at GSI in Germany. We outline the scope and magnitude of such a dedicated national facility and identify critical project milestones. We estimate that, starting with the present level of knowledge and multi-agency support, the goal of using antihydrogen for propulsion purposes may be accomplished in ~50 years.

abstract: It has been proposed that a quantum computer can be constructed based on electron spins in quantum dots or based on a superconducting nanocircuit. During two-qubit operations, the fluctuation of the coupling parameters is a critical factor. One source of such fluctuation is the stirring of the background charges. We focused on the influence of this fluctuation on a coupled spin qubit system. The induced fluctuation in exchange coupling changes the amount of entanglement, fidelity, and purity. In our previous study, the background charge fluctuations were found to be an important channel of dephasing for a single Josephson qubit.

abstract: We outline a scheme to accomplish measurements of a solid state double well system (DWS) with both one and two electrons in non-localised bases. We show that, for a single particle, measuring the local charge distribution at the midpoint of a DWS using an SET as a sensitive electrometer amounts to performing a projective measurement in the parity (symmetric/antisymmetric) eigenbasis. For two-electrons in a DWS, a similar configuration of SET results in close-to-projective measurement in the singlet/triplet basis. We analyse the sensitivity of the scheme to asymmetry in the SET position for some experimentally relevant parameter, and show that it is realisable in experiment.

abstract: Solid state quantum computing proposals rely on adiabatic operations of the exchange gate among localized spins in nanostructures. We study corrections to the Heisenberg interaction between lateral semiconductor quantum dots in an external magnetic field. Using exact diagonalization we obtain the regime of validity of the adiabatic approximation. We also find qualitative corrections to the Heisenberg model at high magnetic fields and in looped arrays of spins. Looped geometries of localized spins generate flux dependent, multi-spin terms which go beyond the basic Heisenberg model.

abstract: Local temperature defined by a local canonical state of the respective subsystem, does not always exist in quantum many body systems. Here, we give some examples of how this breakdown of the temperature concept on small length scales might be observed in experiments: Measurements of magnetic properties of an anti-ferromagnetic spin-1 chain. We show that those magnetic properties are in fact strictly local. As a consequence their measurement reveals whether the local (reduced) state can be thermal. If it is, a temperature may be associated to the measurement results, while this would lead to inconsistencies otherwise.

abstract: We show that nonlinear response of a quantum oscillator displays antiresonant dips and resonant peaks with varying frequency of the driving field. The effect is a consequence of special symmetry and is related to resonant multiphoton mixing of several pairs of oscillator states at a time. We discuss the possibility to observe the antiresonance and the associated multiphoton Rabi oscillations in Josephson junctions.

abstract: A modified version of the Moller-Plesset approach for obtaining the correlation energy associated to a Hartree-Fock ground state is proposed. The method is tested in a model of interacting fermions that allows for an exact solution. Using up to third order terms improved results are obtained, even more accurate in the limit of loosely bound particles. This result suggests the possible convenience of the scheme for the study of chemical bound problems.

abstract: We present a readout method for superconducting flux qubits. The qubit quantum flux state can be measured by determining the Josephson inductance of an inductively coupled DC superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID). We determine the response function of the DC-SQUID and its back-action on the qubit during measurement. Due to driving, the qubit energy relaxation rate depends on the spectral density of the measurement circuit noise at sum and difference frequencies of the qubit Larmor frequency and SQUID driving frequency. The qubit dephasing rate is proportional to the spectral density of circuit noise at the SQUID driving frequency. These features of the backaction are qualitatively different from the case when the SQUID is used in the usual switching mode. For a particular type of readout circuit with feasible parameters we find that single shot readout of a superconducting flux qubit is possible.

abstract: The mergings of energy levels associated with the breaking of PT symmetry in the model of Bender and Boettcher, and in its generalisation to incorporate a centrifugal term, are analysed in detail. Even though conventional WKB techniques fail, it is shown how the ODE/IM correspondence can be used to obtain a systematic approximation scheme which captures all previously-observed features. Nonperturbative effects turn out to play a crucial role, governing the behaviour of almost all levels once the symmetry-breaking transition has been passed. In addition, a novel treatment of the radial Schrodinger equation is used to recover the values of local and non-local conserved charges in the related integrable quantum field theories, without any need for resummation even when the angular momentum is nonzero.

abstract: We emphasize intertwining relations as a universal tool in constructing one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable operators and offer their possible generalization to the multidimensional case. Considered examples include all quasi-exactly solvable operators with invariant subspaces of monomials. We show that the simplest case of generalized intertwining relations allows to naturally relate quasi-exactly solvable operators with two invariant monomial subspaces to a nonlinear parasupersymmetry of second order. Quantum-mechanical systems with linear and nonlinear supersymmetry are discussed from the viewpoint of quasi-exact solvability. We construct such a general system with a cubic supersymmetry and argue that quantum-mechanical systems with nonlinear supersymmetry of fourth order and higher are generally not quasi-exactly solvable. Besides, we construct two examples of quasi-exactly solvable operators with invariant subspaces which cannot be reduced to monomial spaces.

abstract: In previous work, we developed quantum physics on the Moyal plane with time-space noncommutativity, basing ourselves on the work of Doplicher et al.. Here we extend it to certain noncommutative versions of the cylinder, $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $\mathbb{R}\times S^{3}$. In all these models, only discrete time translations are possible, a result known before in the first two cases. One striking consequence of quantised time translations is that even though a time independent Hamiltonian is an observable, in scattering processes, it is conserved only modulo $\frac{2\pi}{\theta}$, where $\theta$ is the noncommutative parameter. (In contrast, on a one-dimensional periodic lattice of lattice spacing $a$ and length $L=Na$, only momentum mod $\frac{2\pi}{L}$ is observable (and can be conserved).) Suggestions for further study of this effect are made. Scattering theory is formulated and an approach to quantum field theory is outlined.

abstract: The perturbative expansion series in coupling constant in QED is divergent. It is either an asymptotic series or an arrangement of a conditionally convergent series. The sum of these types of series depends on the way we arrange partial sums for successive approximations. The $1/N_f$ series expansion, where $N_f$ is the number of flavours, defines a rearrangement of this series, and therefore, its convergence would serve as a proof that the perturbative series is, in fact, conditionallyconvergent.Unfortunately, the $1/N_f$ series also diverges.We proof this usingarguments similar to those of Dyson. We expect that some of the ideas and techniques discussed in our paper will find some use in finding the true nature of the perturbative series in coupling constant as well as the $1/N_f$ expansion series.

abstract: We review recent progress in understanding certain aspects of the thermodynamics of black holes and other horizons. Our discussion centers on various ``entropy bounds'' which have been proposed in the literature and on the current understanding of how such bounds are {\it not} required for the semi-classical consistency of black hole thermodynamics. Instead, consistency under certain extreme circumstances is provided by two effects. The first is simply the exponential enhancement of the rate at which a macrostate with large entropy is emitted in any thermal process. The second is a new sense in which the entropy of an ``object'' depends on the observer making the measurement, so that observers crossing the horizon measure a different entropy flux across the horizon than do observers remaining outside. In addition to the review, some recent criticisms are addressed. In particular, additional arguments and detailed numerical calculations showing the observer dependence of entropy are presented in a simple model. This observer-dependence may have further interesting implications for the thermodynamics of black holes.

abstract: General ideas of gauge/gravity duality allow for the possibility of time dependent solutions that interpolate between a perturbative gauge theory phase and a weakly curved string/gravity phase. Such a scenario applied to cosmology would exhibit a non-geometric phase before the big bang. We investigate a toy model for such a cosmology, whose endpoint is the classical limit of the two-dimensional non-critical string. We discuss the basic dynamics of this model, in particular how it evolves toward the double scaling limit required for stringy dynamics. We further comment on the physics that will determine the fluctuation spectrum of the scalar tachyon. Finally, we discuss various features of this model, and what relevance they might have for a more realistic, higher dimensional scenario.

abstract: We consider tunneling transitions between states separated by an energy barrier in a simple field theoretical model. We analyse the case of soliton creation induced by collisions of a few highly energetic particles. We present semiclassical, but otherwise first principle, study of this process at all energies of colliding particles. We find that direct tunneling to the final state occurs at energies below the critical value E_c, which is slightly higher than the barrier height. Tunneling probability grows with energy in this regime. Above the critical energy, the tunneling mechanism is different. The transition proceeds through creation of a state close to the top of the potential barrier (sphaleron) and its subsequent decay. At certain limiting energy E_l tunneling probability ceases to grow. At higher energies the dominant mechanism of transition becomes the release of energy excess E-E_l by the emission of a few particles and then tunneling at effectively lower energy E=E_l via the limiting semiclassical configuration. The latter belongs to a class of ``real--time instantons'', semiclassical solutions saturating the inclusive probability of tunneling from initial states with given number of particles. We conclude that the process of collision--induced tunneling is exponentially suppressed at all energies.

abstract: In general, quantum field theories (QFT) require regularizations and infinite renormalizations due to ultraviolet divergences in their loop calculations. Furthermore, perturbation series in theories like QED are not convergent series, but are asymptotic series. We apply neutrix calculus, developed in connection with asymptotic series and divergent integrals, to QFT,obtaining finite renormalizations. While none of the physically measurable results in renormalizable QFT is changed, quantum gravity is rendered more manageable in the neutrix framework.

abstract: We consider a model of a leaky quantum wire with the Hamiltonian $-\Delta -\alpha \delta(x-\Gamma)$ in $L^2(\R^2)$, where $\Gamma$ is a compact deformation of a straight line. The existence of wave operators is proven and the S-matrix is found for the negative part of the spectrum. Moreover, we conjecture that the scattering at negative energies becomes asymptotically purely one-dimensional, being determined by the local geometry in the leading order, if $\Gamma$ is a smooth curve and $\alpha \to\infty$.

It is well known that R_sa is a lattice with respect to the usual partial order &#8804; if and only if R is abelian. We define and study a new partial order on R_sa, the spectral order &#8804;_s, which extends &#8804; on projections, is coarser than the usual one, but agrees with it on abelian subalgebras, and turns R_sa into a boundedly complete lattice. The effect algebra E(R) := {A | 0 &#8804; A &#8804; I} is then a complete lattice and we show that the mapping A --> R(A), where R(A) denotes the range projection of A, is a homomorphism from the lattice E(R) onto the projection lattice P(R) of A if and only if R is a finite von Neumann algebra.

abstract: We consider the univalence superselection rule. One would say perhaps ``There is no indication in nature to invalidate this rule. Fermions do not condensate!'' To explain our motivation, let us recall the correspondence of fermion systems and Pauli systems by the Jordan-Wigner transformation. For a finite lattice, fermion grading symmetry corresponds to the Pauli grading. For an infinite lattice, the Pauli-grading can be spontaneously broken e.g. for the XY-model. What is the status of the fermion grading? Nature tells that fermion grading symmmetry cannot be broken for any physical model. But it seems that its rigorous support is needed.

abstract: In the last decade, the development of new ideas in quantum theory, including geometric and deformation quantization, the non-Abelian Berry factor, super- and BRST symmetries, non-commutativity, has called into play the geometric techniques based on the deep interplay between algebra, differential geometry and topology. The present book aims at being a guide to advanced differential geometric and topological methods in quantum mechanics. Their main peculiarity lies in the fact that geometry in quantum theory speaks mainly the algebraic language of rings, modules, sheaves and categories. Geometry is by no means the primary scope of the book, but it underlies many ideas in modern quantum physics and provides the most advanced schemes of quantization.

abstract: In this paper we consider two models which exhibit equilibrium BEC superradiance. They are related to two different types of superradiant scattering observed in recent experiments. The first one corresponds to the amplification of matter-waves due to Raman superradiant scattering from a cigar-shaped BE condensate, when the recoiled and the condensed atoms are in different internal states. The main mechanism is stimulated Raman scattering in two-level atoms, which occurs in a superradiant way. Our second model is related to the superradiant Rayleigh scattering from a cigar-shaped BE condensate. This again leads to a matter-waves amplification but now with the recoiled atoms in the same state as the atoms in the condensate. Here the recoiling atoms are able to interfere with the condensate at rest to form a matter-wave grating (interference fringes) which is observed experimentally.

In the symplectic context quasi-states can be viewed as an algebraic way of packaging certain information contained in Floer theory, and in particular in spectral invariants of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms introduced recently by Yong-Geun Oh. As a consequence we prove a number of new results on rigidity of intersections in symplectic manifolds. This work is a part of a joint project with Paul Biran.

We consider two different models, in which the nonlinear term acts either in the position or in the momentum representation. We numerically investigate the modifications induced by the nonlinearity in the quantum transport in both localized and resonant regimes and a comparison between the results for the two models is presented. Analyzing the momentum distributions and the increase of the mean square momentum, we find that the quantum resonances asymptotically are very stable with respect to the nonlinear perturbation of the rotor's phase evolution. For an intermittent time regime, the nonlinearity even enhances the resonant quantum transport, leading to superballistic motion.

We also propose a practical method for the variation-after-projection calculation, by approximating entropy without conflict with the Peierls inequality. The quantum number projection in the finite-temperature mean-field theory will be useful to study effects of quantum fluctuations associated with the conservation laws on thermal properties of nuclei.

abstract: The possibility to observe vacuum electron-positron pair creation due to a powerful optical laser pulse is discussed. We employ a quantum kinetic formulation of the problem with a source term describing the vacuum pair production in a homogeneous electric field with arbitrary time dependence (dynamical Schwinger mechanism). For a periodic field weak in comparison with the critical value E_{cr}=m^2/|e|, the electron-positron plasma density changes approximately periodically with twice the field frequency. Under these conditions, the mean value $<n>$ for the density per period in the volume lambda^3 is a more appropriate characteristic quantity than the residual density n_r which is taken over an integer number of field periods and calculated using the imaginary time method. The value <n> is proportional to the squared field intensity and does not depend on the frequency. We show that in terms of the parameter <n> an optical laser can be more effective than a X-ray one. We expect that it is possible to observe the vacuum creation effect not only by means of the planned X-ray free electron lasers but already at present-day optical lasers.
