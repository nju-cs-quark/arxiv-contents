**1.    Wavefunction Collapse and Random Walk**  
Brian Collett, Philip Pearle  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208009  
<blockquote>
<p>
Wavefunction collapse models modify Schrodinger's equation so that it describes the rapid evolution of a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states to one of them. This provides a phenomenological basis for a physical resolution to the so-called "measurement problem." Such models have experimentally testable differences from standard quantum theory. The most well developed such model at present is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model in which a fluctuating classical field interacts with particles to cause collapse. One "side effect" of this interaction is that the field imparts momentum to particles, causing a small blob of matter to undergo random walk. Here we explore this in order to supply predictions which could be experimentally tested. We examine the translational diffusion of a sphere and a disc, and the rotational diffusion of a disc, according to CSL. For example, we find that a disc of radius 2 cdot 10^{-5} cm and thickness 0.5 cdot 10^{-5} cm diffuses through 2 pi rad in about 70sec (this assumes the "standard" CSL parameter values). The comparable rms diffusion of standard quantum theory is smaller than this by a factor 10^-3. At the reported pressure of < 5 cdot10^{-17} Torr, achieved at 4.2^{circ} K, the mean time between air molecule collisions with the disc is approximately 45min (and the diffusion caused by photon collisons is utterly negligible). This is ample time for observation of the putative CSL diffusion over a wide range of parameters. This encourages consideration of how such an experiment may actually be performed, and the paper closes with some thoughts on this subject

**2.    Absorption problems for quantum walks in one dimension**  
Norio Konno, Takao Namiki, Takahiro Soshi, Aidan Sudbury  
J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., Vol. 36, No.1, pp.241-253 (2003)  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208122  
<blockquote>
<p>
This paper treats absorption problems for the one-dimensional quantum walk determined by a 2 times 2 unitary matrix U on a state space {0,1,...,N} where N is finite or infinite by using a new path integral approach based on an orthonormal basis P, Q, R and S of the vector space of complex 2 times 2 matrices. Our method studied here is a natural extension of the approach in the classical random walk.

**3.    The quantum to classical transition for random walks**  
Todd A. Brun, Hilary A. Carteret, Andris Ambainis  
Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 130602 (2003).  
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208195  
<blockquote>
<p>
We look at two possible routes to classical behavior for the discrete quantum random walk on the line: decoherence in the quantum ``coin'' which drives the walk, or the use of higher-dimensional coins to dilute the effects of interference. We use the position variance as an indicator of classical behavior, and find analytical expressions for this in the long-time limit; we see that the multicoin walk retains the ``quantum'' quadratic growth of the variance except in the limit of a new coin for every step, while the walk with decoherence exhibits ``classical'' linear growth of the variance even for weak decoherence.
