**1.    Quantum lower bounds by quantum arguments**

<blockquote>
<p>
We propose a new method for proving lower bounds on quantum query algorithms. Instead of a classical adversary that runs the algorithm with one input and then modifies the input, we use a quantum adversary that runs the algorithm with a superposition of inputs. If the algorithm works correctly, its state becomes entangled with the superposition over inputs. We bound the number of queries needed to achieve a sufficient entanglement and this implies a lower bound on the number of queries for the computation. Using this method, we prove two new $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ lower bounds on computing AND of ORs and inverting a permutation and also provide more uniform proofs for several known lower bounds which have been previously proven via variety of different techniques.
