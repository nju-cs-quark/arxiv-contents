abstract: We propose a scheme for creating quantum superposition states involving of order $10^{14}$ atoms via the interaction of a single photon with a tiny mirror. This mirror, mounted on a high-quality mechanical oscillator, is part of a high-finesse optical cavity which forms one arm of a Michelson interferometer. By observing the interference of the photon only, one can study the creation and decoherence of superpositions involving the mirror. All experimental requirements appear to be within reach of current technology.

abstract: Using an operational definition we quantify the entanglement, $E_P$, between two parties who share an arbitrary pure state of $N$ indistinguishable particles. We show that $E_P \leq E_M$, where $E_M$ is the bipartite entanglement calculated from the mode-occupation representation. Unlike $E_M$, $E_P$ is {\em super-additive}. For example, $E_P =0$ for any single-particle state, but the state $\ket{1}\ket{1}$, where both modes are split between the two parties, has $E_P = 1/2$. We discuss how this relates to quantum correlations between particles, for both fermions and bosons.

abstract: The matrix 2x2 spectral differential equation of the second order is considered on x in ($-\infty,+\infty$). We establish elementary Darboux transformations covariance of the problem and analyze its combinations. We select a second covariant equation to form Lax pair of a coupled KdV-MKdV system. The sequence of the elementary Darboux transformations of the zero-potential seed produce two-parameter solution for the coupled KdV-MKdV system with reductions. We show effects of parameters on the resulting solutions (reality, singularity). A numerical method for general coupled KdV-MKdV system is introduced. The method is based on a difference scheme for Cauchy problems for arbitrary number of equations with constants coefficients. We analyze stability and prove the convergence of the scheme which is also tested by numerical simulation of the explicit solutions.

abstract: We consider a generalized quantum teleportation protocol for an unknown qubit using non-maximally entangled state as a shared resource. Without recourse to local filtering or entanglement concentration, using standard Bell-state measurement and classical communication one cannot teleport the state with unit fidelity and unit probability. We show that using non-maximally entangled measurements one can teleport an unknown state with unit fidelity albeit with reduced probability, hence probabilistic teleportation. We also give a generalized protocol for entanglement swapping using non-maximally entangled states.

abstract: Analytic solutions to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for cutoff wave initial conditions are used to investigate the time evolution of the transmitted probability density for tunneling. For a broad range of values of the potential barrier opacity $\alpha$, we find that the probability density exhibits two evolving structures. One refers to the propagation of a {\it forerunner} related to a {\it time domain resonance} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 64}, 0121907 (2001)], while the other consists of a semiclassical propagating wavefront. We find a regime where the {\it forerunners} are absent, corresponding to positive {\it time delays}, and show that this regime is characterized by opacities $\alpha < \alpha_c$. The critical opacity $\alpha_c$ is derived from the analytical expression for the {\it delay time}, that reflects a link between transient effects in tunneling and the {\it delay time}

abstract: Transient tunneling effects in triple barrier systems are investigated by considering a time-dependent solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a cutoff wave initial condition. We derive a two-level formula for incidence energies $E$ near the first resonance doublet of the system. Based on that expression we find that the probability density along the internal region of the potential, is governed by three oscillation frequencies: one of them refers to the well known Bohr frequency, given in terms of the first and second resonance energies of the doublet, and the two others, represent a coupling with the incidence energy $E$. This allows to manipulate the above frequencies to control the tunneling transient behavior of the probability density in the short-time regime

abstract: By using an exact solution to the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a point source initial condition, we investigate both the time and spatial dependence of quantum waves in a step potential barrier. We find that for a source with energy below the barrier height, and for distances larger than the penetration length, the probability density exhibits a {\it forerunner} associated with a non-tunneling process, which propagates in space at exactly the semiclassical group velocity. We show that the time of arrival of the maximum of the {\it forerunner} at a given fixed position inside the potential is exactly the traversal time, $\tau$. We also show that the spatial evolution of this transient pulse exhibits an invariant behavior under a rescaling process. This analytic property is used to characterize the evolution of the {\it forerunner}, and to analyze the role played by the time of arrival, $3^{-1/2}\tau$, found recently by Muga and B\"{u}ttiker [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 62}, 023808 (2000)].

abstract: The fastest tunneling response in double barrier resonant structures is investigated by considering explicit analytic solutions of the time dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation. For cutoff initial plane waves, we find that the earliest tunneling events consist on the emission of a series of propagating pulses of the probability density governed by the buildup oscillations in the quantum well. We show that the fastest tunneling response comes from the contribution of incident carriers at energies different from resonance, and that its relevant time scale is given by $\tau_r=\pi \hbar /| E-\epsilon | $, where $\epsilon $ is the resonance energy and $E$ is the incidence energy.

abstract: The processes of radiation damping and decoherence in Quantum Electrodynamics are studied from an open system's point of view. Employing functional techniques of field theory, the degrees of freedom of the radiation field are eliminated to obtain the influence phase functional which describes the reduced dynamics of the matter variables. The general theory is applied to the dynamics of a single electron in the radiation field. From a study of the wave packet dynamics a quantitative measure for the degree of decoherence, the decoherence function, is deduced. The latter is shown to describe the emergence of decoherence through the emission of bremsstrahlung caused by the relative motion of interfering wave packets. It is argued that this mechanism is the most fundamental process in Quantum Electrodynamics leading to the destruction of coherence, since it dominates for short times and because it is at work even in the electromagnetic field vacuum at zero temperature. It turns out that decoherence trough bremsstrahlung is very small for single electrons but extremely large for superpositions of many-particle states.

We test Bell inequality with 2-photon interferometry where we replace the beamsplitters by acousto-optic modulators, which are equivalent to moving beamsplitters. We measure the 2-photon beatings induced by the frequency shifts, and we propose a cryptographic scheme in relation. Finally, setting the experiment in a relativistic configuration, we demonstrate that the quantum correlations are not only independent of the distance but also of the time ordering between the two single-photon measurements.

By reformulating Hardy's assumptions, and modifying a part of his proof, in terms of Bayesian probabilities, we show that his work can be easily reconciled with a Bayesian interpretation of quantum probability.

During a transition, a pulse of electric current causes transport of a virtual vortex-antivortex pair around the cylinder. We consider both the instanton approach, in which the transition is viewed as motion of vortices in the Euclidean time, and the real-time dual formulation, in which vortices are described by a fundamental quantum field. The instanton approach is convenient to discuss effects of the environment, while in the dual formulation we show that there exists a potentially useful adiabatic regime, in which the probability to create a real vortex pair is exponentially suppressed, but the total transport of the vortex number can be of order one.

Using Ambainis' adversary method, we exactly characterize QC(f) as the square root of RC(f). We then use this result to prove the new relation R0(f) = O(Q2(f)^2 Q0(f) log n) for total f, where R0, Q2, and Q0 are zero-error randomized, bounded-error quantum, and zero-error quantum query complexities respectively. Finally we give asymptotic gaps between the measures, including a total f for which C(f) is superquadratic in QC(f), and a symmetric partial f for which QC(f) = O(1) yet Q2(f) = Omega(n/log n).

The cavity is externally driven and the output is continuously monitored via homodyne measurements. We derive formulas for the optimal rates at which these measurements provide information about (i) the quantum state of the system composed of atom and electromagnetic field, and (ii) the coupling strength between atom and field. We find that the two information rates are anticorrelated.

We show that the experimental results are extremely well described by time-periodic Hamiltonians with momentum quantized in units of the atomic recoil. The observed tunneling has a well defined period when only two Floquet states dominate the dynamics. Beat frequencies are observed when three Floquet states dominate. We find frequencies which match those observed in both experiments. The dynamical origin of the dominant Floquet states is identified.

abstract: We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve quantum computation based on a pair of orthogonal cyclic states. In this scheme, quantum gates can be implemented based on the total phase accumulated in cyclic evolutions. In particular, geometric quantum computation may be achieved by eliminating the dynamic phase accumulated in the whole evolution. Therefore, both dynamic and geometric operations for quantum computation are workable in the present theory. Physical implementation of this set of gates is designed for NMR systems. Also interestingly, we show that a set of universal geometric quantum gates in NMR systems may be realized in one cycle by simply choosing specific parameters of the external rotating magnetic fields. In addition, we demonstrate explicitly a multiloop method to remove the dynamic phase in geometric quantum gates. Our results may provide useful information for the experimental implementation of quantum logical gates.

We found that the interaction is essentially the same as the one for the dipole-dipole interaction; i.e., qubit-qubit coupling of the NMR quantum gate. Therefore a quantum gate could be constructed by the same operation sequence for the NMR device if the coupling is small enough. The result gives an information to the effort of development of the devices assuming capacitive coupling between qubits.

abstract: Iterated functions system (IFS) is defined by specifying a set of functions in a classical phase space, which act randomly on an initial point. In an analogous way, we define a quantum iterated functions system (QIFS), where functions act randomly with prescribed probabilities in the Hilbert space. In a more general setting a QIFS consists of completely positive maps acting in the space of density operators. We present exemplary classical IFSs, the invariant measure of which exhibits fractal structure, and study properties of the corresponding QIFSs and their invariant states.

We are mainly interested in a possibility of using the Fokker-Planck equation to describe this evolution. Studying different interaction Hamiltonians, we show that unambiguous reduction to the Fokker-Planck equation is possible only within the framework of the so called rotating-wave approximation. As special cases we consider in detail the evolution of two coupled oscillators and relaxation of a charged oscillator in a uniform magnetic field.

abstract: With the exception of the harmonic oscillator, quantum wave-packets usually spread as time evolves. We show here that, using the nonlinear resonance between an internal frequency of a system and an external periodic driving, it is possible to overcome this spreading and build non-dispersive (or non-spreading) wave-packets which are well localized and follow a classical periodic orbit without spreading. From the quantum mechanical point of view, the non-dispersive wave-packets are time periodic eigenstates of the Floquet Hamiltonian, localized in the nonlinear resonance island. We discuss the general mechanism which produces the non-dispersive wave-packets, with emphasis on simple realization in the electronic motion of a Rydberg electron driven by a microwave field. We show the robustness of such wavepackets for a model one-dimensional as well as for realistic three dimensional atoms. We consider their essential properties such as the stability versus ionization, the characteristic energy spectrum and long lifetimes. The requirements for experiments aimed at observing such non-dispersive wave-packets are also considered. We also discuss other related phenomena in atomic and molecular physics as well as possible further extensions of the theory.

abstract: Our investigation aims to study the specific role played by entanglement in the quantum computation process, by elaborating an entangled spin model developed within the 'hidden measurement approach' to quantum mechanics. We show that an arbitrary tensor product state for the entity consisting of two entangled qubits can be described in a complete way by a specific internal constraint between the ray and density states of the two qubits. For the individual qubits we use a sphere model representation, which is a generalization of the Bloch or Pauli representation, where also the collapse and noncollapse measurements are represented. We identify a parameter r in [0,1], arising from the Schmidt diagonal decomposition, that is a measure of the amount of entanglement, such that for r = 0 the system is in the singlet state with 'maximal' entanglement, and for r = 1 the system is in a pure product state.

abstract: We study the quantum Zeno effect and the anti-Zeno effect in the case of `indirect' measurements, where a measuring apparatus does not act directly on an unstable system, for a realistic model with finite errors in the measurement. A general and simple formula for the decay rate of the unstable system under measurement is derived. In the case of a Lorentzian form factor, we calculate the full time evolutions of the decay rate, the response of the measuring apparatus, and the probability of errors in the measurement. It is shown that not only the response time but also the detection efficiency plays a crucial role. We present the prescription for observing the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects, as well as the prescriptions for avoiding or calibrating these effects in general experiments.

abstract: The whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of quartz microspheres are investigated for the purpose of strong coupling between single photons and atoms in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). Within our current understanding of the loss mechanisms of the WGMs, the saturation photon number, n, and critical atom number, N, cannot be minimized simultaneously, so that an "optimal" sphere size is taken to be the radius for which the geometric mean, (n x N)^(1/2), is minimized. While a general treatment is given for the dimensionless parameters used to characterize the atom-cavity system, detailed consideration is given to the D2 transition in atomic Cesium (852nm) using fused-silica microspheres, for which the maximum coupling coefficient g/(2*pi)=750MHz occurs for a sphere radius a=3.63microns corresponding to the minimum for n=6.06x10^(-6). By contrast, the minimum for N=9.00x10^(-6) occurs for a sphere radius of a=8.12microns, while the optimal sphere size for which (n x N)^(1/2) is minimized occurs at a=7.83microns. On an experimental front, we have fabricated fused-silica microspheres with radii a=10microns and consistently observed quality factors Q=0.8x10^(7). These results for the WGMs are compared with corresponding parameters achieved in Fabry-Perot cavities to demonstrate the significant potential of microspheres as a tool for cavity QED with strong coupling.

Different types of separability may be possible, depending on the particular factorization or split of the Hilbert space. A given orthonormal basis set for a Hilbert space is defined to be of type (p,q) if p elements of the basis are entangled and q are separable, relative to a given bi-partite factorization of that space. We conjecture that not all basis types exist for a given Hilbert space.

For a strong magnetic field B the problem can be restricted to one particular Landau-level. First we represent generators of the algebra of the non-commutative torus as finite dimensional matrices. A second approach leads to a reducible representation with a $\theta$-dependent center. For a simple periodic potential, the rational part of the Hofstadter-butterfly spectrum is obtained.

This result is based on numerical simulations of the Hamiltonian dynamics (the Schrodinger equation) and the numerical solution of the master equation.

Finally it is briefly mentioned possible application of such algebraic methods to design of quantum processors (programmable gates arrays) and discussed generalization to quantum computation with continuous variables.

abstract: The major conceptual difficulties of quantum mechanics are analyzed. They are: the notion "wave-particle", the probabilistic interpretation of the Schroedinger wave \psi-function and hence the probability amplitude and its phase, long-range action, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, etc. The probabilistic formalism is developed in the phase space, but not in the real one. Elimination of the difficulties is likely if we are able to develop quantum mechanics in the real space. Such a theory in fact can be constructed, however, it should proceed from deepest first principles starting from the notion of a 4D space-time, the notion of a massive particle in the space, the principles of the motion of a particle, etc. The theory should be characterized by short-range action that automatically means the introduction of a quantum mechanical force. It is shown that the aforementioned force makes it evident and, moreover, is able to appear on the macroscopic scale. A simple experiment, the express test, which in fact proves the macroscopic manifestation of quantum mechanical force, is proposed for the demonstration in the quantum curriculum.

The dynamics of the system is computed efficiently up to a time $t\geq \ell$, and then the localization length $\ell$ can be obtained with accuracy $\nu$ by means of order $1/\nu^2$ computer runs, followed by coarse grained projective measurements on the computational basis. We also show that in the presence of static imperfections a reliable computation of the localization length is possible without error correction up to an imperfection threshold which drops polynomially with the number of qubits.

abstract: The majority of quantum open system models in the literature are simplistic in the sense that they only explicitly account for that part of the environment that directly interacts with the system of interest. A quantum open system with an open environment is examined using the projection operator method in the weak coupling limit. The openness of environment is modelled by nonunitary evolution of the Lindblad form. Under certain conditions, the resulting master equation for the system is insensitive to the initial state of the environment and to initial entanglements between the system and environment for time scales greater than the environment relaxation timescales. For the particular case of an environment consisting of a harmonic oscillator bath, the resulting master equations are demonstrated to have the algebraic form for completely positive evolution. The open environment model is illustrated for the particular case of a system linearly coupled to an oscillator bath.

abstract: We consider the use of a traveling wave probe to continuously measure the quantum state of an atom in free space. Unlike the more familiar cavity QED geometry, the traveling wave is intrinsically a multimode problem. Using an appropriate modal decomposition we determine the effective measurement strength for different atom-field interactions and different initial states of the field. These include the interaction of a coherent-state pulse with an atom, the interaction of a Fock-state pulse with an atom, and the use of Faraday rotation of a polarized laser probe to perform a QND measurement on an atomic spin.

abstract: Noiseless subsystems offer a general and efficient method for protecting quantum information in the presence of noise that has symmetry properties. A paradigmatic class of error models displaying non-trivial symmetries emerges under collective noise behavior, which implies a permutationally-invariant interaction between the system and the environment. We describe experiments demonstrating the preservation of a bit of quantum information encoded in a three qubit noiseless subsystem for general collective noise. A complete set of input states is used to determine the super-operator for the implemented one-qubit process and to confirm that the fidelity of entanglement is improved for a large, non-commutative set of engineered errors. To date, this is the largest set of error operators that has been successfully corrected for by any quantum code.

abstract: Two approaches toward the arrow of time for scattering processes have been proposed in rigged Hilbert space quantum mechanics. One, due to Arno Bohm, involves preparations and registrations in laboratory operations and results in two semigroups oriented in the forward direction of time. The other, employed by the Brussels-Austin group, is more general, involving excitations and de-excitations of systems, and apparently results in two semigroups oriented in opposite directions of time. It turns out that these two time arrows can be related to each other via Wigner's extensions of the spacetime symmetry group. Furthermore, their are subtle differences in causality as well as the possibilities for the existence and creation of time-reversed states depending on which time arrow is chosen.

abstract: Due to the Heisemberg uncertainty principle, it is impossible to design a procedure which permits perfect cloning of an arbitrary, unknown "qubit" (the spin or polarization state of a single quantum system)1,2. However, it is believed that a perfect copying protocol can be achieved, at least in principle, if the qubit to be copied is destroyed in the original system. Quantum teleportation3,4 is supposed to allow for such a result. Here, this belief is shown to be invalidated by a fundamental uncertainty about the number of particles involved in any process, as predicted by Quantum Field Theory. As a result, teleportation cannot provide an infallible copying procedure for the single qubits, not even in the limit of perfect experimental sensitivities. The no-cloning theorem1,2 can then be generalized to the case of destroying the original. Teleportation remains an interesting statistical procedure, having an unavoidable theoretical error at the percent level or few orders of magnitude smaller, depending on the physical process that is used. Although it cannot be made arbitrarily small, such an error is small enough to remain hidden in present experiments.

abstract: Cloning machines, that is, transformations that achieve the best approximate copying of a quantum state compatible with the no-cloning theorem, have been a fundamental research topic over the last five years. This study is of particular significance given the close connection between quantum cloning and quantum cryptography: using an optimal cloner generally makes it possible to obtain a tight bound on the best individual eavesdropping strategy in a quantum cryptosystem. In this Chapter, the issue of cloning a continuous-variable quantum system will be analyzed, and a Gaussian cloning transformation will be introduced. This cloner, which copies equally well any two canonically conjugate continuous variables, duplicates all coherent states with a same fidelity (F=2/3). The optical implementation of this cloner and its extension to N-to-M cloners will also be discussed. Finally, the use of this cloner for the security assessment of a quantum key distribution scheme relying on continuous (Gaussian) key carriers will be sketched.

abstract: Quantum states cannot be cloned. I show how to extend this property to classical messages encoded using quantum states, a task I call "uncloneable encryption." An uncloneable encryption scheme has the property that an eavesdropper Eve not only cannot read the encrypted message, but she cannot copy it down for later decoding. She could steal it, but then the receiver Bob would not receive the message, and would thus be alerted that something was amiss. I prove that any authentication scheme for quantum states acts as a secure uncloneable encryption scheme. Uncloneable encryption is also closely related to quantum key distribution (QKD), demonstrating a close connection between cryptographic tasks for quantum states and for classical messages. Thus, studying uncloneable encryption and quantum authentication allows for some modest improvements in QKD protocols. While the main results apply to a one-time key with unconditional security, I also show uncloneable encryption remains secure with a pseudorandom key. In this case, to defeat the scheme, Eve must break the computational assumption behind the pseudorandom sequence before Bob receives the message, or her opportunity is lost. This means uncloneable encryption can be used in a non-interactive setting, where QKD is not available, allowing Alice and Bob to convert a temporary computational assumption into a permanently secure message.

abstract: Quantum random walks on graphs have been shown to display many interesting properties, including exponentially fast hitting times when compared with their classical counterparts. However, it is still unclear how to use these novel properties to gain an algorithmic speed-up over classical algorithms. In this paper, we present a quantum search algorithm based on the quantum random walk architecture that provides such a speed-up. It will be shown that this algorithm performs an oracle search on a database of $N$ items with $O(\sqrt{N})$ calls to the oracle, yielding a speed-up similar to other quantum search algorithms. It appears that the quantum random walk formulation has considerable flexibility, presenting interesting opportunities for development of other, possibly novel quantum algorithms.

abstract: Heisenberg's position-measurement--momentum-disturbance relation is derivable from the uncertainty relation $\sigma(q)\sigma(p) \geq \hbar/2$ only for the case when the particle is initially in a momentum eigenstate. Here I derive a new measurement--disturbance relation which applies when the particle is prepared in a twin-slit superposition and the measurement can determine at which slit the particle is present. The relation is $d \times \Delta p \geq 2\hbar/\pi$, where $d$ is the slit separation and $\Delta p=D_{M}(P_{f},P_{i})$ is the Monge distance between the initial $P_{i}(p)$ and final $P_{f}(p)$ momentum distributions.

abstract: We show that a nonlinear Hamiltonian evolution can transform an SU(3) coherent state into a superposition of distinct SU(3) coherent states, with a superposition of two SU(2) coherent states presented as a special case. A phase space representation is depicted by projecting the multi-dimensional $Q$-symbol for the state to a spherical subdomain of the coset space. We discuss realizations of this nonlinear evolution in the contexts of nonlinear optics and Bose--Einstein condensates.

abstract: Grover discovered a quantum algorithm for identifying a target element in an unstructured search universe of N items in approximately square-root of N queries to a quantum oracle, thus achieving a square-root speed-up over classical algorithms. We present an information-theoretic analysis of Grover's algorithm and show that the square-root speed-up is the best attainable result using Grover's oracle.

abstract: We show that thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum computation are solely determined by the quality of single-system operations if one allows for d-dimensional systems with $8 \leq d \leq 32$. Each system serves to store one logical qubit and additional auxiliary dimensions are used to create and purify entanglement between systems. Physical, possibly probabilistic two-system operations with error rates up to 2/3 are still tolerable to realize deterministic high quality two-qubit gates on the logical qubits. The achievable error rate is of the same order of magnitude as of the single-system operations. We investigate possible implementations of our scheme for several physical set-ups.

abstract: The ideal scalar Aharonov-Bohm (SAB) and Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect involve a magnetic dipole pointing in a certain fixed direction: along a purely time dependent magnetic field in the SAB case and perpendicular to a planar static electric field in the AC case. We extend these effects to arbitrary direction of the magnetic dipole. The precise conditions for having nondispersive precession and interference effects in these generalized set ups are delineated both classically and quantally. Under these conditions the dipole is affected by a nonvanishing torque that causes pure precession around the directions defined by the ideal set ups. It is shown that the precession angles are in the quantal case linearly related to the ideal phase differences, and that the nonideal phase differences are nonlinearly related to the ideal phase differences. It is argued that the latter nonlinearity is due the appearance of a geometric phase associated with the nontrivial spin path. It is further demonstrated that the spatial force vanishes in all cases except in the classical treatment of the nonideal AC set up, where the occurring force has to be compensated by the experimental arrangement. Finally, for a closed space-time loop the local precession effects can be inferred from the interference pattern characterized by the nonideal phase differences and the visibilities. It is argued that this makes it natural to regard SAB and AC as essentially local and nontopological effects.

abstract: We demonstrate how insights gained from reformulating the problem of quantum teleportation into one of reversing quantum operations, and designing optimum completely positive maps for teleportation, can enable one to explore optimal approximate reversal of quantum operations on a single qubit. In particular, we show that the optimal approximate reversal of a generalized depolarizing channel can be achieved using only unitary transformations. We also show that for a quantum channel, which reveals some information about the input state, extremal completely positive maps and not unitary transformations yield optimal approximate reversal.

abstract: Proposals for quantum computing devices are many and varied. They each have unique noise processes that make none of them fully reliable at this time. There are several error correction/avoidance techniques which are valuable for reducing or eliminating errors, but not one, alone, will serve as a panacea. One must therefore take advantage of the strength of each of these techniques so that we may extend the coherence times of the quantum systems and create more reliable computing devices. To this end we give a general strategy for using dynamical decoupling operations on encoded subspaces. These encodings may be of any form; of particular importance are decoherence-free subspaces and quantum error correction codes. We then give means for empirically determining an appropriate set of dynamical decoupling operations for a given experiment. Using these techniques, we then propose a comprehensive encoding solution to many of the problems of quantum computing proposals which use exchange-type interactions. This uses a decoherence-free subspace and an efficient set of dynamical decoupling operations. It also addresses the problems of controllability in solid state quantum dot devices.

abstract: In this paper we prove that the inequality introduced by Collins, Gisin, Linden, Massar and Popescu is tight, or in other words, it is a facet of the convex polytope generated by all local-realistic joint probabilities of d outcomes. This means that this inequality is optimal. We also show that, for correlation functions generalized to deal with three-outcome measurements, the satisfyability of this inequality is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a local-realistic model accounting for them.

abstract: It is argued that the findings of a recent reanalysis by Compagno and Persico [Phys. Rev. A 57, 1595 (1998)] of the Bohr--Rosenfeld procedure for the measurement of a single space-time-averaged component of the electromagnetic field are incorrect when the field measurement time is shorter than that required for light to traverse the measurement's test body. To this end, the time-averaged "self-force" on the test body, assumed for simplicity to be of a spherical shape, is evaluated in terms of a one-dimensional quadrature for the general trajectory allowed for the test body by Compagno and Persico, and in closed form for the limiting steplike trajectory used by Bohr and Rosenfeld.

journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: What Niels Bohr called the `epistemological lesson' of `complementarity' was the result of reasoning analogically from the classical conception of a mechanical state to a new quantum mechanical conception of an `object' in a mechanical state. Bohr proposed to redefine the `objectivity' essential for scientific description in terms of the epistemological demand for unambiguously communicable descriptions of observational results, a move which has profound consequences for how we can understand the concept of the quantum mechanical state and the nature of the `system' which is `in' this state. Here it is argued that the old notion of the `object' which is in a classical mechanical state is drawn from a substance/property ontology derived from Aristotle's analysis of categorical propositions. In moving to describing a system in a quantum mechanical state, the system that is `in' such a state can no longer be so regarded as a substance possessing properties. Bohr argues that the concept refers to an interaction which has a feature of wholeness or `individuality' that implies that the distinction between `object system' and `observing system' is relative to the context of the description. This conclusion, in turn, implies the need for a combination of complementary modes of description; however, because of his reticence in making ontological claims, he failed to develop this dimension of his new framework of complementarity.

It is shown that the minimum operation time of the gate is tau = (h/4E)(1+2 theta/pi), where h is Planck's constant, E is the quantum-mechanical average energy, and theta is the phase shift modulo pi. [We changed the name of a macro file to a more Windows-friendly one, and we clarified the remark "Note that..." after equation (4).]

abstract: We describe Kitaev's result from 1999, in which he defines the complexity class QMA, the quantum analog of the class NP, and shows that a natural extension of 3-SAT, namely local Hamiltonians, is QMA complete. The result builds upon the classical Cook-Levin proof of the NP completeness of SAT, but differs from it in several fundamental ways, which we highlight. This result raises a rich array of open problems related to quantum complexity, algorithms and entanglement, which we state at the end of this survey. This survey is the extension of lecture notes taken by Naveh for Aharonov's quantum computation course, held in Tel Aviv University, 2001.

abstract: When a quantum system interacts with an external environment, it undergoes the loss of quantum correlation (decoherence) and the loss of energy (relaxation) and eventually all of the quantum information becomes classical. Here we show a general principle to use unitary operations to establish and preserve particular non-equilibrium states in arbitrary relaxing quantum systems. We elucidate these concepts with examples of state preservation in one-spin and two-spin entangled systems.

abstract: A suitable generalized measurement described by a 4-element positive operator-valued measure (POVM) on each particle of a two-qubit system in the singlet state is, from the point of view of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen's (EPR's) criterion of elements of reality, equivalent to a random selection between two alternative projective measurements. It is shown that an EPR-experiment with a fixed POVM on each particle provides a violation of Bell's inequality without requiring local observers to choose between the alternatives. This approach could be useful for designing a loophole-free test of Bell's inequality.

abstract: We study the possibility of supersymmetry (SUSY) in quantum mechanics in one dimension under the presence of a point singularity. The system considered is the free particle on a line R or on the interval [-l, l] where the point singularity lies at x = 0. In one dimension, the singularity is known to admit a U(2) family of different connection conditions which include as a special case the familiar one that arises under the Dirac delta-potential. Similarly, each of the walls at x = l and x = -l admits a U(1) family of boundary conditions including the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions. Under these general connection/boundary conditions, the system is shown to possess an N = 1 or N = 2 SUSY for various choices of the singularity and the walls, and the SUSY is found to be `good' or `broken' depending on the choices made. We use the supercharge which allows for a constant shift in the energy, and argue that if the system is supersymmetric then the supercharge is self-adjoint on states that respect the connection/boundary conditions specified by the singularity.

abstract: We analyze the coherence properties of neutron wave packets, after they have interacted with a phase shifter undergoing different kinds of statistical fluctuations. We give a quantitative (and operational) definition of decoherence and compare it to the standard deviation of the distribution of the phase shifts. We find that in some cases the neutron ensemble is more coherent, even though it has interacted with a wider (i.e. more disordered) distribution of shifts. This feature is independent of the particular definition of decoherence: this is shown by proposing and discussing an alternative definition, based on the Wigner function, that displays a similar behavior. We briefly discuss the notion of entropy of the shifts and find that, in general, it does not correspond to that of decoherence of the neutron.

This ciphering scheme can be optically amplified without degrading the security level. New avenues are open to secure communications at high speeds in fiber-optic or free-space channels.

Our results suggest that with present-day technology, micro-cavities can be built around the atom with sufficiently high finesse to permit unambiguous detection of a single atom in the trap with 10 $\mu$s of integration. We compare resonant and non-resonant detection schemes and we discuss the requirements for detecting an atom without causing it to undergo spontaneous emission.

The former is parametrized by SO(3, R), while the latter is parametrized by SO(2,R), except when the 2x2 state is pure. Using this parametrization some quantum information measures are obtained. In the process it is shown how to solve one variation of the classical Procustes problem. The appendix is devoted to the first step in extending this work to higher dimensions.

The models are governed by the Burgers equation at the macroscopic scale, achieved by taking the limit where the grid size and time step both approach zero and by performing a perturbative Chapman-Enskog expansion. The quantum algorithm exploiting superposition and entanglement is more efficient than the classical one because the quantum algorithm requires less memory. Furthermore, its viscosity can be made arbitrarily small.

By using a time-frequency analysis, we find the existence of a regime characterized by the opacity of the barrier, where the maximum peak of a forerunner measured at the barrier transmission edge $x=L$ corresponds to a genuine tunneling process. The corresponding time scale represents the tunneling time of the forerunner through the classically forbidden region.

abstract: It is a challenging problem to construct an efficient quantum algorithm which can compute the Jones' polynomial for any knot or link obtained from platting or capping of a $2n$-strand braid. We recapitulate the construction of braid-group representations from vertex models. We present the eigenbases and eigenvalues for the braiding generators and its usefulness in direct evaluation of Jones' polynomial. The calculation suggests that it is possible to associate a series of unitary operators for any braid word. Hence we propose a quantum algorithm using these unitary operators as quantum gates acting on a $2n$ qubit state. We show that the quantum computation gives Jones' polynomial for achiral knots and links.

abstract: This paper is motivated by the computer-generated nonadditive ((5,6,2)) code described in an article by Rains, Hardin, Shor and Sloane. We describe a theory of non-stabilizer codes of which the nonadditive code of Rains et al is an example. Furthermore, we give a general strategy of constructing good nonstabilizer codes from good stabilizer codes and give some explicit constructions and asymptotically good nonstabilizer codes. In fact, we explicitly construct a family of distance 2 non-stabilizer codes over all finite fields of which the ((5,6,2)) is an special example. More interestingly, using our theory, we are also able to explicitly construct examples of non-stablizer quantum codes of distance 3. Like in the case of stabilizer codes, we can design fairly efficient encoding and decoding procedures.

abstract: The introduction of spinor and other massive fields by ``quantizing'' particles (corpuscles) is conceptually misleading. Only spatial fields must be postulated to form the fundamental objects to be quantized (that is, to define a formal basis for all quantum states), while apparent ``particles'' are a mere consequence of decoherence. This conclusion is also supported by the nature of gauge fields.

abstract: Operator-Schmidt decompositions of the quantum Fourier transform on C^N1 tensor C^N2 are computed for all N1, N2 > 1. The decomposition is shown to be completely degenerate when N1 is a factor of N2 and when N1>N2. The first known special case, N1=N2=2^n, was computed by Nielsen in his study of the communication cost of computing the quantum Fourier transform of a collection of qubits equally distributed between two parties.

abstract: Epiphenomenalism is shown to be absurd because the development of consciousness must be explainable through natural selection. A detailed neuromolecular basis of the neuromediator release is given and it is stressed on the possible key point where the quantum mind could act, namely presynaptic scaffold protein dynamics and detachment of the calcium sensor v-SNARE synaptotagmin-1. The beta-neurexin molecules are tuned via fast propagating solitons by the quantum coherent microtubule network so that the beta-neurexin molecule thermal vibrations could promote or suppress conformational changes via vibrational multidimensional tunneling, which drives synaptotagmin-1 detachment from the SNARE complex under calcium ion binding. Following the synaptotagmin-1 detachment membrane fusion takes place in SNARE dependent fashion and the presynaptic vesicle spills neuromediator in the synaptic cleft. Thus the quantum transfer of information causally affects the neuromediator release.

These bounds depends of simple parameters like the number of measurement settings or the dimensionality of the entangled quantum state. We derive them by constructing explicit local-hidden variable models which reproduce the quantum correlations for sufficiently small detectors efficiency.

abstract: A useful and universal formula for the expectation value of the radial operator in the presence of the Aharonov-Bohm flux and the Coulomb Field is established. We find that the expectation value $< r^{\lambda}>$ $(-\infty \leq \lambda \leq \infty)$ is greatly affected due to the non-local effect of the magnetic flux although the Aharonov-Bohm flux does not have any dynamical significance in classical mechanics. In particular, the quantum fluctuation increases in the presence of the magnetic flux due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. In addition, the Virial theory in quantum mechanics is also constructed for the spherically symmetric system under the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

The characterization of entanglement, i.e. the possibility to assert if a given quantum state is entangled with others and how much entangled it is, remains one of the most fundamental open questions in quantum information theory. We discuss our recent results related to the problem of separability and distillability for distinguishable particles, employing the tool of witness operators. Finally, we also state our results concerning quantum correlations for indistinguishable particles.

abstract: We describe a quantum computer based upon the coherent manipulation of two-level atoms between discrete one-dimensional momentum states. Combinations of short laser pulses with kinetic energy dependent free phase evolution can perform the logical invert, exchange, CNOT and Hadamard operations on any qubits in the binary representation of the momentum state, as well as conditional phase inversion. These allow a binary right-rotation, which halves the momentum distribution in a single coherent process. Fields for the coherent control of atomic momenta may thus be designed as quantum algorithms.

abstract: There have been theoretical and experimental studies on quantum nonlocality for continuous variables, based on dichotomic observables. In particular, we are interested in two cases of dichotomic observables for the light field of continuous variables: One case is even and odd numbers of photons and the other case is no photon and presence of photons. We analyze various observables to give the maximum violation of Bell's inequalities for continuous-variable states. We discuss an observable which gives the violation of Bell's inequality for any entangled pure continuous variable state. However, it does not have to be a maximally entangled state to give the maximal violation of Bell's inequality. This is attributed to a generic problem of testing the quantum nonlocality of an infinite-dimensional state using a dichotomic observable.

It is shown that the change in the density of states near a defect resonance is much more pronounced than that one near the band edges. In particular, operation near the band edge as suggested from a 1D analysis is little suited for controlling the photon emission.

abstract: Previously, an explicit solution for the time evolution of the Wigner function was presented in terms of auxiliary phase space coordinates which obey simple equations that are analogous with, but not identical to, the classical equations of motion. They can be solved easily and their solutions can be utilized to construct the time evolution of the Wigner function. In this paper, the usefulness of this explicit solution is demonstrated by solving a numerical example in which the Wigner function has strong spatial and temporal variations as well as regions with negative values. It is found that the explicit solution gives a correct description of the time evolution of the Wigner function. We examine next the pseudoparticle approximation which uses classical trajectories to evolve the Wigner function. We find that the pseudoparticle approximation reproduces the general features of the time evolution, but there are deviations. We show how these deviations can be systematically reduced by including higher-order correction terms in powers of $\hbar^2$.

abstract: We prove that for every Bell's inequality and for a broad class of protocols, there always exists a multi-party communication complexity problem, for which the protocol assisted by states which violate the inequality is more efficient than any classical protocol. Moreover, for that advantage Bell's inequality violation is a necessary and sufficient criterion. Thus, violation of Bell's inequalities has a significance beyond that of a non-optimal-witness of non-separability.

The results indicate for many physical problems on composite quantum systems the description based on majorization of eigenvalues is not sufficient

abstract: Analyzing the properties of entanglement in many-particle spin-1/2 systems is generally difficult because the system's Hilbert space grows exponentially with the number of constituent particles, $N$. Fortunately, it is still possible to investigate many-particle entanglement when the state of the system possesses sufficient symmetry. In this paper, we present a practical method for efficiently computing various bipartite entanglement measures for states in the symmetric subspace and perform these calculations for $N\sim 10^3$. By considering all possible bipartite splits, we construct a picture of the multiscale entanglement in large symmetric systems. In particular, we characterize dynamically generated spin-squeezed states by comparing them to known reference states (e.g., GHZ and Dicke states) and new families of states with near-maximal bipartite entropy. We quantify the trade-off between the degree of entanglement and its robustness to particle loss, emphasizing that substantial entanglement need not be fragile.

abstract: The desired shifts of the boundaries of spectral allowed zones of periodical systems are demonstrated. In particular, the phenomenon of merging neighbor allowed zones is exhibited and its simple explanation is given. It is also shown how to change the additional fundamental spectral parameter, the degree of exponential solution growth, at arbitrary given energy points inside the forbidden zones. This allows one to control tunneling through fragments of periodic structures at energies belonging to spectral gap. All the results are based on the finite interval inverse eigenvalue problem which provides us with complete sets of exactly solvable models. This is a radical extension (continuous ! multiplicity) in comparison to the famous finite-gap models.

These expansions are valid on any fixed time interval, and caustics do not contribute to the asymptotics.

The model of an optical cavity having a movable end mirror, and supporting different modes is employed. The mechanical motion of the mirror mediates information between the modes leading to an effective mode-mode interaction. We characterize the modes' entanglement on the basis of recent separability criteria. The effect of the thermal noise associate to the mirror's motion is accounted for. Then, we evaluate the performances of such {\it ponderomotive entanglement} in possible applications like teleportation and telecloning.

It is generally assumed that there is a maximum limit on the amount of energy that can be extracted from a Dirac quantum state, due to its interaction with an electric field. In this article it is shown that this assumption is not correct and that, for a properly applied electric field, an arbitrarily large amount of energy can be extracted from the quantum state.

abstract: A pure state decoheres into a mixed state as it entangles with an environment. When an entangled two-mode system is embedded in a thermal environment, however, each mode may not be entangled with its environment by their simple linear interaction. We consider an exactly solvable model to study the dynamics of a total system, which is composed of an entangled two-mode system and a thermal environment, and also an array of infinite beam splitters. It is shown that many-body entanglement of the system and the environment plays a crucial role in the process of disentangling the system.

abstract: The control of thermal decoherence via dynamical decoupling and via the quantum Zeno effect (Zeno control) is investigated for a model of trapped ion, where the dynamics of two low lying hyperfine states undergoes decoherence due to the thermal interaction with an excited state. Dynamical decoupling is a procedure that consists in periodically driving the excited state, while the Zeno control consists in frequently measuring it. When the control frequency is high enough, decoherence is shown to be suppressed. Otherwise, both controls may accelerate decoherence.

abstract: The transport of ultra-cold atoms in magneto-optical potentials provides a clean setting in which to investigate the distinct predictions of classical versus quantum dynamics for a system with coupled degrees of freedom. In this system, entanglement at the quantum level and chaos at the classical level arise from the coupling between the atomic spin and its center-of- mass motion. Experiments, performed deep in the quantum regime, correspond to dynamic quantum tunneling. This nonclassical behavior is contrasted with the predictions for an initial phase space distribution produced in the experiment, but undergoing classical Hamiltonian flow. We study conditions under which the trapped atoms can be made to exhibit classical dynamics through the process of continuous measurement, which localizes the probability distribution to phase space trajectories, consistent with the uncertainty principle and quantum back-action noise. This method allows us to analytically and numerically identify the quantum-classical boundary.

abstract: A tripartite entangled state of bright optical field is experimentally produced using an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state for continuous variables and linear optics. The controlled dense coding among a sender, a receiver and a controller is demonstrated by exploiting the tripartite entanglement. The obtained three-mode position correlation and relative momentum correlation between the sender and the receiver and thus the improvements of the measured signal to noise ratios of amplitude and phase signals with respect to the shot noise limit are 3.28dB and 3.18dB respectively. If the mean photon number $\bar{n}$ equals 11 the channel capacity can be controllably inverted between 2.91 and 3.14. When $\bar{n}$ is larger than 1.0 and 10.52 the channel capacities of the controlled dense coding exceed the ideal single channel capacities of coherent and squeezed state light communication.

The possibilities of dressed ZRP are illustrated by model calculation of the low-energy electron-Silane ($\hbox{SiH}_4$) scattering. The results are discussed.

abstract: Quantum mechanical real-time tunneling through general scattering potentials is studied in the semiclassical limit. It is shown that the exact path integral of the real-time propagator is dominated in the long time sector by quasi-stationary fluctuations associated with caustics. This leads to an extended semiclassical propagation scheme for wave packet dynamics which accurately describes deep tunneling through static and, for the first time, driven barrier potentials.

abstract: Several recent experiments have demonstrated the promise of atomic ensembles for quantum teleportation and quantum memory. In these cases the collective internal state of the atoms is well described by continuous variables $X_1, P_1$ and the interaction with the optical field ($X_2, P_2$) by a quadratic Hamiltonian $X_1X_2$. We show how this interaction can be used optimally to create entanglement and squeezing. We derive conditions for the efficient simulation of quadratic Hamiltonians and the engineering of all Gaussian operations and states.

abstract: Entanglement, or quantum inseparability, is a crucial resource in quantum information applications, and therefore the experimental generation of separated yet entangled systems is of paramount importance. Experimental demonstrations of inseparability with light are not uncommon, but such demonstrations in physically well-separated massive systems, such as distinct gases of atoms, are new and present significant challenges and opportunities. Rigorous theoretical criteria are needed for demonstrating that given data are sufficient to confirm entanglement. Such criteria for experimental data have been derived for the case of continuous-variable systems obeying the Heisenberg-Weyl (position- momentum) commutator. To address the question of experimental verification more generally, we develop a sufficiency criterion for arbitrary states of two arbitrary systems. When applied to the recent study by Julsgaard, Kozhekin, and Polzik [Nature 413, 400 - 403 (2001)] of spin-state entanglement of two separate, macroscopic samples of atoms, our new criterion confirms the presence of spin entanglement.

abstract: We describe a mathematical solution for the generation of entangled N-photon states in two field modes. A simple and compact solution is presented for a two-mode Jaynes-Cummings model by combining the two field modes in a way that only one of the two resulting quasi-modes enters in the interaction term. The formalism developed is then applied to calculate various generation probabilities analytically. We show that entanglement, starting from an initial field and an atom in one defined state may be obtained in a single step. We also show that entanglement may be built up in the case of an empty cavity and excited atoms whose final states are detected, as well as in the case when the final states of the initially excited atoms are not detected.

abstract: This paper tries to probe the relation between the local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states and the distillation of entanglement. An new interpretation for the distillation of entanglement and the distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states in terms of information is given, respectively. By constraining our discussion on a special protocol we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the local distinguishability of the orthogonal pure states, and gain the maximal yield of the distillable entanglement. It is shown that the information entropy, the locally distinguishability of quantum states and the distillation of entanglement are closely related.

journal:

abstract: In this paper, we use the methods found in quant-ph/0201095 to create a continuous variable analogue of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. By this we mean a quantum hidden subgroup algorithm that finds the period P of a function F:R-->R from the reals R to the reals R, where F belongs to a very general class of functions, called the class of admissible functions. One objective in creating this continuous variable quantum algorithm was to make the structure of Shor's factoring algorithm more mathematically transparent, and thereby give some insight into the inner workings of Shor's original algorithm. This continuous quantum algorithm also gives some insight into the inner workings of Hallgren's Pell's equation algorithm. Two key questions remain unanswered. Is this quantum algorithm more efficient than its classical continuous variable counterpart? Is this quantum algorithm or some approximation of it implementable?

abstract: We demonstrate one- and two-photon diffraction and interference experiments utilizing parametric down-converted photon pairs (biphotons) and a transmission grating. With two-photon detection, the biphoton exhibits a diffraction-interference pattern equivalent to that of an effective single particle that is associated with half the wavelength of the constituent photons. With one-photon detection, however no diffraction-interference pattern is observed. We show that these phenomena originate from the spatial quantum correlation between the down-converted photons.

abstract: Existence of self-similar, superposed pulse-train solutions of the nonlinear, coupled Maxwell-Schr\"odinger equations, with the frequencies controlled by the oscillator strengths of the transitions, is established. Some of these excitations are specific to the resonant media, with energy levels in the configurations of $\Lambda$ and $N$ and arise because of the interference effects of cnoidal waves, as evidenced from some recently discovered identities involving the Jacobian elliptic functions. Interestingly, these excitations also admit a dual interpretation as single pulse-trains, with widely different amplitudes, which can lead to substantially different field intensities and population densities in different atomic levels.

abstract: Hess and Philipp have constructed what, they claim, is a local hidden variables model reproducing the empirical predictions of quantum mechanics. In this paper explicit expressions for the conditional probabilities for the outcomes of the measurements at the two detectors are calculated. These expressions provide a conclusive demonstration of the falsity of the authors' claim. The authors give two different accounts of their model. The published version omits a crucial detail. As a result it disagrees with quantum mechanics. It also violates signal locality. The unpublished version agrees with quantum mechanics. However, it violates the condition of parameter independence, as Myrvold has previously shown.

abstract: The development of key devices and systems in quantum information technology, such as entangled particle sources, quantum gates and quantum cryptographic systems, requires a reliable and well-established method for characterizing how well the devices or systems work. We report our recent work on experimental characterization of pulsed entangled photonic states and photonic quantum channels, using the methods of state and process tomography. By using state tomography, we could reliably evaluate the states generated from a two-photon source under development and develop a highly entangled pulsed photon source. We are also devoted to characterization of single-qubit and two-qubit photonic quantum channels. Characterization of typical single-qubit decoherence channels has been demonstrated using process tomography. Characterization of two-qubit channels, such as classically correlated channels and quantum mechanically correlated channels is under investigation. These characterization techniques for quantum states and quantum processes will be useful for developing photonic quantum devices and for improving their performances.

comments: Minor changes made and addresses updated. Related material now at this http URL

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210150
abstract: It has long been known that the "detection loophole", present when detector efficiencies are below a critical figure, could open the way for alternative "local realist" explanations for the violation of Bell tests. It has in recent years become common to assume the loophole can be ignored, regardless of which version of the Bell test is employed. A simple model is presented that illustrates that this may not be justified. Two of the versions -- the standard test of form -2 <= S <= 2 and the currently-popular "visibility" test -- are at grave risk of bias. Statements implying that experimental evidence "refutes local realism" or shows that the quantum world really is "weird" should be reviewed. The detection loophole is on its own unlikely to account for more than one or two test violations, but when taken in conjunction with other loopholes (briefly discussed) it is seen that the experiments refute only a narrow class of "local hidden variable" models, applicable to idealised situations, not to the real world. The full class of local realist models provides straightforward explanations not only for the publicised Bell-test violations but also for some lesser-known "anomalies".

abstract: A central feature in the Copenhagen interpretation is the use of classical concepts from the outset. Modern developments show, however, that the emergence of classical properties can be understood within the framework of quantum theory itself, through the process of decoherence. This fact becomes most crucial for the interpretability of quantum cosmology - the application of quantum theory to the Universe as a whole. I briefly review these developments and emphasize the importance of an unbiased attitude on the interpretational side for future progress in physics.

Two others are shown to be lower bounds on the I-concurrence, and on the I-tangle, respectively [P. Rungta and C. M. Caves, to appear in Phys. Rev. A]. We compare these bounds with the I-concurrence and I-tangle on the isotropic states, and on rank-two density operators resulting from a Tavis-Cummings interaction. Our results provide a global structure relating several different entanglement measures. Additionally, they possess analytic forms which are easily evaluated in the most general cases.

abstract: We investigate a quantum algorithm which simulates efficiently the quantum kicked rotator model, a system which displays rich physical properties, and enables to study problems of quantum chaos, atomic physics and localization of electrons in solids. The effects of errors in gate operations are tested on this algorithm in numerical simulations with up to 20 qubits. In this way various physical quantities are investigated. Some of them, such as second moment of probability distribution and tunneling transitions through invariant curves are shown to be particularly sensitive to errors. However, investigations of the fidelity and Wigner and Husimi distributions show that these physical quantities are robust in presence of imperfections. This implies that the algorithm can simulate the dynamics of quantum chaos in presence of a moderate amount of noise.

Significantly, we demonstrate that the entangling power of a general controlled unitary operator acting on two equal-dimensional qudits is proportional to the corresponding operator entanglement if linear entropy is adopted as the quantity representing the degree of entanglement. We discuss the entangling power and operator entanglement of three representative quantum gates on qudits: the SUM, double SUM, and SWAP gates.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210157
abstract: Many promising ideas for quantum computing demand the experimental ability to directly switch 'on' and 'off' a physical coupling between the component qubits. This is typically the key difficulty in implementation, and precludes quantum computation in generic solid state systems, where interactions between the constituents are 'always on'. Here we show that quantum computation is possible in strongly coupled (Heisenberg) systems even when the interaction cannot be controlled. The modest ability of 'tuning' the transition energies of individual qubits proves to be sufficient, with a suitable encoding of the logical qubits, to generate universal quantum gates. Furthermore, by tuning the qubits collectively we provide a scheme with exceptional experimental simplicity: computations are controlled via a single 'switch' of only six settings. Our schemes are applicable to a wide range of physical implementations, from excitons and spins in quantum dots through to bulk magnets.

abstract: Quantum random walks have been much studied recently, largely due to their highly nonclassical behavior. In this paper, we study one possible route to classical behavior for the discrete quantum random walk on the line: the use of multiple quantum ``coins'' in order to diminish the effects of interference between paths. We find solutions to this system in terms of the single coin random walk, and compare the asymptotic limit of these solutions to numerical simulations. We find exact analytical expressions for the time-dependence of the first two moments, and show that in the long time limit the ``quantum mechanical'' behavior of the one-coin walk persists. We further show that this is generic for a very broad class of possible walks, and that this behavior disappears only in the limit of a new coin for every step of the walk.

abstract: An exactly soluble non-linear interaction Hamiltonian is proposed to study fundamental properties of the entanglement dynamics for a coupled non-linear oscillators. The time-evolved state is obtained analytically for initial products of two coherent and two number states and relevant informations are extracted from the dynamics of various quantities like subsystem linear and Von Neumann entropies, quadrature mean values, variances and Q-functions. We determined the re-coherence time scales and found among the interaction terms present in the Hamiltonian the one responsible for the entanglement in both cases. We identify the existence of two regimens for the entanglement dynamics in the case of initially coherent states: the short time, phase spread regimen where the entropy rises monotonically and the self-interference regimen where the entropy oscillates and re-coherence phenomenon can be observed. We also found that the break time from the first regimen to the second one becomes longer, as well as the re-coherence and reversibility times, as the Planck's constant becomes much smaller than a typical action in phase space.

The results are also discussed in the context of quantum programming.

The construction of the RHS of $H_0$ provides yet another opportunity to see that when continuous spectrum is present, the solutions of the Schrodinger equation lie in a RHS rather than just in a Hilbert space.

abstract: The recent proposed realignment separability criterion for mixed is analyzed. We identify the essential part of this criterion is a swap operator followed by a partial transposition. Then we analyze the separability criterion of permutation indices of the density matrix for multipartite state which is a generalization of the realignment criterion. We give a method to solve the equivalence problem of the separability criterion of permutation indices of the density matrix. For tripartite state, we show the non-trivial separability criteria are either partial transposition criterion or realignment criterion.

abstract: We discuss level schemes of small quantum-dot turnstiles and their applicability in the production of entanglement in two-photon emission. Due to the large energy splitting of the single-electron levels, only one single electron level and one single hole level can be made resonant with the levels in the conduction band and valence band. This results in a model with nine distinct levels, which are split by the Coulomb interactions. We show that the optical selection rules are different for flat and tall cylindrically symmetric dots, and how this affects the quality of the entanglement generated in the decay of the biexciton state. The effect of charge carrier tunneling and of a resonant cavity is included in the model.

For a microcavity consisting of crossed anisotropic layers, we derive the cavity resonance frequencies, and spontaneous emission rates. For a dielectric structure with dissipative loss and central layer with gain, the beta factor of direct spontaneous emission into a cavity mode and the laser threshold is calculated.

abstract: Universal quantum cloning machines (UQCMs), sometimes called quantum cloners, generate many outputs with identical density matrices, with as close a resemblance to the input state as is allowed by the basic principles of quantum mechanics. Any experimental realization of a quantum cloner has to cope with the effects of decoherence which terminate the coherent evolution demanded by a UQCM. We examine how many clones can be generated within a decoherence time. We compare the time that a quantum cloner implemented with trapped ions requires to produce $M$ copies from $N$ identical pure state inputs and the decoherence time during which the probability of spontaneous emission becomes non-negligible. We find a method to construct an $N\to M$ cloning circuit, and estimate the number of elementary logic gates required. It turns out that our circuit is highly vulnerable to spontaneous emission as the number of gates in the circuit is exponential with respect to the number of qubits involved.

abstract: We present a new derivation of the Casimir force between two parallel plane mirrors at zero temperature. The two mirrors and the cavity they enclose are treated as quantum optical networks. They are in general lossy and characterized by frequency dependent reflection amplitudes. The additional fluctuations accompanying losses are deduced from expressions of the optical theorem. A general proof is given for the theorem relating the spectral density inside the cavity to the reflection amplitudes seen by the inner fields. This density determines the vacuum radiation pressure and, therefore, the Casimir force. The force is obtained as an integral over the real frequencies, including the contribution of evanescent waves besides that of ordinary waves, and, then, as an integral over imaginary frequencies. The demonstration relies only on general properties obeyed by real mirrors which also enforce general constraints for the variation of the Casimir force.

abstract: The nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation may be achieved using coupled low-capacitance Josephson juctions. We show that the nonadiabtic effects as well as the adiabatic condition are very important for these systems. Moreover, we find that it may be hard to detect the adiabatic Berry's phase in this kind of superconducting nanocircuits; but the nonadiabatic phase may be measurable with current techniques. Our results may provide useful information for the implementation of geometric quantum computation.

abstract: I review and expand the model of quantum associative memory that I have recently proposed. In this model binary patterns of n bits are stored in the quantum superposition of the appropriate subset of the computational basis of n qbits. Information can be retrieved by performing an input-dependent rotation of the memory quantum state within this subset and measuring the resulting state. The amplitudes of this rotated memory state are peaked on those stored patterns which are closest in Hamming distance to the input, resulting in a high probability of measuring a memory pattern very similar to it. The accuracy of pattern recall can be tuned by adjusting a parameter playing the role of an effective temperature. This model solves the well-known capacity shortage problem of classical associative memories, providing an exponential improvement in capacity. The price to pay is the probabilistic nature of information retrieval, a feature that, however, this model shares with our own brain.

We also calculate the probability for obtaining the required states.

In the type I experiment, a symmetric wavefunction of bosons leads to constructive quantum interference and shows final state stimulation, while an anti-symmetric wavefunction of fermions results in destructive quantum interference and inhibited matter wave mixing. In the type II experiment, a coherent superposition state leads to constructive quantum interference and enhanced matter wave mixing for both bosons and fermions, independent of their quantum statistics.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: The problem of unambiguous state discrimination consists of determining which of a set of known quantum states a particular system is in. One is allowed to fail, but not to make a mistake. The optimal procedure is the one with the lowest failure probability. This procedure has been extended to bipartite states where the two parties, Alice and Bob, are allowed to manipulate their particles locally and communicate classically in order to determine which of two possible two-particle states they have been given. The failure probability of this local procedure has been shown to be the same as if the particles were together in the same location. Here we examine the effect of restricting the classical communication between the parties, either allowing none or eliminating the possibility that one party's measurement depends on the result of the other party's. These issues are studied for two-qubit states, and optimal procedures are found. In some cases the restrictions cause increases in the failure probability, but in other cases they do not. Applications of these procedures, in particular to secret sharing, are discussed.

abstract: The quantum random walk has been much studied recently, largely due to its highly nonclassical behavior. In this paper, we study one possible route to classical behavior for the discrete quantum walk on the line: the presence of decoherence in the quantum ``coin'' which drives the walk. We find exact analytical expressions for the time dependence of the first two moments of position, and show that in the long-time limit the variance grows linearly with time, unlike the unitary walk. We compare this to the results of direct numerical simulation, and see how the form of the position distribution changes from the unitary to the usual classical result as we increase the strength of the decoherence.

Solving the two-level theory with the rotating-wave approximation and the SU(2) method, we obtain analytic formulae that give excellent descriptions of the geometric phase, energy, and wavefunction of the resonating system. In particular, we observe a sudden $\pi$-jump in the geometric phase when the system is in resonance. We found similar behaviors in the geometric phase of a spin-1/2 particle in a rotating magnetic field, for which we developed a geometrical model to help visualize its evolution.

Both schemes require a pair of entangled light beams. The first scheme utilizes two phase sensitive optical amplifiers, whilst the second uses an electro-optic feedforward loop for the reconstruction of the secret. We examine the efficacy of quantum secret sharing in terms of fidelity, as well as the signal transfer coefficients and the conditional variances of the reconstructed output state. We show that both schemes in the ideal case yield perfect secret reconstruction.

abstract: For the two-mode exciton system formed by the quasi-spin wave collective excitation of many $\Lambda$ atoms fixed at the lattice sites of a crystal, we discover a dynamic symmetry depicted by the semi-direct product algebra $SU(2)\bar{\otimes} h_2 $ in the large $N$ limit with low excitations. With the help of the spectral generating algebra method, we obtain a larger class of exact zero-eigenvalue states adiabatically interpolating between the initial state of photon-type and the final state of quasi-spin wave exciton-type. The conditions for the adiabatic passage of dark states are shown to be valid, even with the presence of the level degeneracy. These theoretical results can lead to propose new protocol of implementing quantum memory robust against quantum decoherence.

A general information scheme is proposed for a quantum-physical experiment. In this scheme, informational optimization of an experimental setup is formulated as a mathematical problem.

abstract: A physical interpretation of the mathematical consequence of Lorentz transformation within spatial relativity theory is presented as a result of my new physical model of existent fluctuating vacuum (FlcVcm). It is assumed that the FlcVcm is considered as a molecular dielectric, which consists from neutral dynamides, streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is a neutral pair, consistent by two massless opposite point-like elementary electric charges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (-) and positrino (+). In a frozen equilibrium position two contrary pont-like ElmElcChrgs within every one dynamide are very closely installed one to another and therefore the aggregate polarization of every dynamide and its electric field also have zero values. The aggregate electric field of every dynamide polarizes nearest neighbors dynamides in an account of which nearest dynamides interact between them-self, because of which their elementary excitations, phonons and photons, have a wave character and behaviors. We suppose that the photon is an polarization result of the phonon within the fluctuating vacuum considered as an ideal dielectric and therefore the photon could be considered as an elementary collective excitation of the FlcVcm in the form of a solitary needle cylindrical harmonic oscillation. Hence the light, which is a packet of the photons, must move within FlcVcm with constant velocity and Dopler effect must be observed in both cases, for the light and sound. Then all mathematical results of Lorentz transformation could be considered as results of a demand of an independence of the observation results from the reactive velocity of the observation frame.

abstract: In the one-dimensional stationary case, we construct a mechanical Lagrangian describing the quantum motion of a non-relativistic spinless system. This Lagrangian is written as a difference between a function $T$, which represents the quantum generalization of the kinetic energy and which depends on the coordinate $x$ and the temporal derivatives of $x$ up the third order, and the classical potential $V(x)$. The Hamiltonian is then constructed and the corresponding canonical equations are deduced. The function $T$ is first assumed arbitrary. The development of $T$ in a power series together with the dimensional analysis allow us to fix univocally the series coefficients by requiring that the well-known quantum stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation be reproduced. As a consequence of this approach, we formulate the law of the quantum motion representing a new version of the quantum Newton's law. We also analytically establish the famous Bohm's relation % $\mu \dot{x} = \partial S_0 /\partial x $ % outside of the framework of the hydrodynamical approach and show that the well-known quantum potential, although it is a part of the kinetic term, it plays really a role of an additional potential as assumed by Bohm.

abstract: The problem of security of quantum key protocols is examined. In addition to the distribution of classical keys, the problem of encrypting quantum data and the structure of the operators which perform quantum encryption is studied. It is found that unitary bases are central to both encryption of quantum information, as well as the generation of states used in generalized quantum key distribution (which are called mutually unbiased bases). A one-to-one correspondence between certain unitary bases and mutually unbiased bases is found. Finally, a new protocol for making anonymous classical broadcasts is given along with a security proof. An experimental procedure to implement this protocol is also given. In order to prove these new results, some new bounds for accessible information of quantum sources are obtained.

abstract: We describe a universal information compression scheme that compresses any pure quantum i.i.d. source asymptotically to its von Neumann entropy, with no prior knowledge of the structure of the source. We introduce a diagonalisation procedure that enables any classical compression algorithm to be utilised in a quantum context. Our scheme is then based on the corresponding quantum translation of the classical Lempel-Ziv algorithm. Our methods lead to a conceptually simple way of estimating the entropy of a source in terms of the measurement of an associated length parameter while maintaining high fidelity for long blocks. As a by-product we also estimate the eigenbasis of the source. Since our scheme is based on the Lempel-Ziv method, it can be applied also to target sequences that are not i.i.d.

abstract: A structural similarity between Classical Mechanics (CM) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) was revealed by P.A.M. Dirac in terms of Lie Algebras: while in CM the dynamics is determined by the Lie algebra of Poisson brackets on the manifold of scalar fields for classical position/momentum observables q/p, d/dt q={q,H}, d/dt p={p,H}, QM evolves (in Heisenberg's picture) according to the formally similar Lie algebra of commutator brackets of the corresponding operators Q/P: d/dt Q=i/h [Q,H], d/dt P=i/h [P,H] where QP-PQ=ih. A further common framework for comparing CM and QM is the category of symplectic manifolds. Other than previous authors, this paper considers phase space of Heisenberg's picture, i.e., the manifold of pairs of operator observables (Q,P) satisfying commutation relation. On a sufficiently high algebraic level of abstraction -- which we believe to be of interest on its own -- it turns out that this approach leads to a truly NON-linear yet Hamiltonian reformulation of QM evolution.

We characterize the asymptotic dynamics of the system in the limit of small mass ratio, with an explicit control of the error. We derive the corresponding reduced density matrix for the heavy particle and explicitly compute the (partial) decoherence effect for the heavy particle induced by the presence of the light one for a particular set up of the parameters.

abstract: In this paper we address the problem to give a concrete support to the idea, originally stemming from Niels Bohr, that quantum mechanics must be rooted inside the physics of macroscopic systems. It is shown that, starting from the formalism of the non-equilibrium statistical operator, which is now a consolidated part of quantum statistical mechanics, particular correlations between two isolated systems can be singled out and interpreted as microsystems. In this way also a new framework is established in which questions of decoherence can be naturally addressed.

abstract: In this work, we consider a family of sure-success quantum algorithms, which is grouped into even and odd members for solving a generalized Grover search problem. We prove the matching conditions for both groups and give the corresponding formulae for evaluating the iterations or oracle calls required in the search computation. We also present how to adjust the phase angles in the generalized Grover operator to ensure the sure-success if minimal oracle calls are demanded in the search.

abstract: We present a scheme to perform universal quantum computation using global addressing techniques as applied to a physical system of endohedrally doped fullerenes. The system consists of an ABAB linear array of Group V endohedrally doped fullerenes. Each molecule spin site consists of a nuclear spin coupled via a Hyperfine interaction to an electron spin. The electron spin of each molecule is in a quartet ground state $S=3/2$. Neighboring molecular electron spins are coupled via a magnetic dipole interaction. We find that an all-electron construction of a quantum cellular automata is frustrated due to the degeneracy of the electronic transitions. However, we can construct a quantum celluar automata quantum computing architecture using these molecules by encoding the quantum information on the nuclear spins while using the electron spins as a local bus. We deduce the NMR and ESR pulses required to execute the basic cellular automata operation and obtain a rough figure of merit for the the number of gate operations per decoherence time. We find that this figure of merit compares well with other physical quantum computer proposals. We argue that the proposed architecture meets well the first four DiVincenzo criteria and we outline various routes towards meeting the fifth criteria: qubit readout.

abstract: Two approaches used in the description of the channeling radiation emitted from relativistic positrons are compared with each other. In the first (traditional) case, the probability of the process is proportional to a sum of absolute squares of the amplitudes of the transition between two states with definite transverse energy levels of the positrons traversing single crystals. In the second case, we begin with calculation of the sum of amplitudes for transition between states with different transverse energy levels for corresponding radiation frequency, and then the sum is squared. One must keep in mind that the latter approach can be used only in the case when positrons move in a nearly harmonic planar potential with equidistant transverse energy levels. It is shown that the calculation based on the second approach can give rise to a peak structure in the spectrum when the number of transverse energy levels is much greater than one.

abstract: We study generalized measurements (POVM measurements) on a single d-level quantum system which is in a completely unknown pure state, and derive the best estimate of the post-measurement state. The mean post-measuremement estimation fidelity of a generalized measurement is obtained and related to the operation fidelity of the device. This illustrates how the information gain about the post-measurement state and the corresponding state disturbance are mutually dependent. The connection between the best estimates of the pre- and post-measurement state is established and interpreted. For pure generalized measurements the two states coincide.

abstract: Considering what the world would be like if backwards causation were possible is usually mind-bending. Here I discuss something that is easier to study: a toy model that incorporates a very restricted sort of backwards causation. It defines particle world lines by means of a kind of differential delay equation with negative delay. The model presumably prohibits signalling to the past and superluminal signalling, but allows nonlocality while being fully covariant. And that is what constitutes the model's value: it is an explicit example of the possibility of Lorentz invariant nonlocality. That is surprising in so far as many authors thought that nonlocality, in particular nonlocal laws for particle world lines, must conflict with relativity. The development of this model was inspired by the search for a fully covariant version of Bohmian mechanics.

abstract: A physical model of the fluctuating vacuum (FlcVcm) and the photon as an elementary collective excitation in a solitary needle cylindrical form are offered. We assume that the FlcVcm is consistent by neutral dynamides, which are streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is a neutral pair, consistent by massless opposite point-like elementary electric charges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (-) and positrino (+). In an equilibrium position two contrary Pnt-Lk ElmElcChrgs within every one dynamide are very closely installed one to another and therefore its aggregate polarization and its ElcFld also have zero values. However the absence of a mass in a rest of an electrino and positrino makes possible they to display an infinitesimal inertness of their own QntElcMgnFlds and a big mobility, what permits them to be found a bigger time in an unequilibrium distorted position. The aggregate ElcFld of dynamide reminds us that it could be considered as the QntElcFld of an electric quasi-dipole because both massless electrino and positrino have the same inertness. The aggregate ElcFld of every dynamide polarizes nearest neighbour dynamides in an account of which they interact between them-self, on account of which their photons display a wave character and behaviour. In order to obtain a clear physical evidence and true physical explanation of an emission and absorption of RlPhtns, I use Fermi method for the determination of the time dependence of expansion coefficients of wave function of SchEl in a hybrid state, using the solution of the Schrodinger quadratic differential wave equation in partial derivatives with the potentials of Coulomb and of Lorentz friction force.

abstract: The energy of fluctuating electromagnetic field is investigated for the thermal Casimir force acting between parallel plates made of real metal. It is proved that for nondissipative media with temperature independent dielectric permittivity the energy at nonzero temperature comprises of the (renormalized) energies of the zero-point and thermal photons. In this manner photons can be considered as collective elementary excitations of the matter of plates and electromagnetic field. If the dielectric permittivity depends on temperature the energy contains additional terms proportional to the derivatives of dielectric permittivity with respect to temperature, and the quasiparticle interpretation of the fluctuating field is not possible. The correlation between energy and free energy is considered. Previous calculations of the Casimir energy in the framework of the Lifshitz formula at zero temperature and optical tabulated data supplemented by the Drude model at room temperature are analysed. It is demonstrated that this quantity is not a good approximation either for the free energy or the energy. A physical interpretation of this hybrid quantity is suggested. The contradictory results in the recent literature on whether the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula for the perpendicular polarized modes has any effective contribution to the physical quantities are discussed. Four main approaches to the resolution of this problem are specified. The precise expressions for entropy of the fluctuating field between plates made of real metal are obtained, which helps to decide between the different approaches. The conclusion is that the Lifshitz formula supplemented by the plasma model and the surface impedance approach are best suited to describe the thermal Casimir force between real metals.

abstract: Some aspects of the physical nature of language are discussed. In particular, physical models of language must exist that are efficiently implementable. The existence requirement is essential because without physical models no communication or thinking would be possible. Efficient implementability for creating and reading language expressions is discussed and illustrated with a quantum mechanical model. The reason for interest in language is that language expressions can have meaning, either as an informal language or as a formal language associated with a mathematical or physical theory. It is noted that any universally applicable physical theory, or coherent theory of physics and mathematics together, includes in its domain physical models of expressons for both the informal language used to discuss the theory and expressions of the theory itself. It follows that there must be formulas in the formal theory that express some of their own physical properties. Inclusion of intelligent system in the theory domain means that the theory, e.g., quantum mechanics, must describe in some sense its own validation. Maps of language expressions into physical states are discussed as are conditions under which such a map is a Godel map. The possibility that language is also mathematical is very briefly discussed.

abstract: We systematically study the fluorescence of low density Frenkel excitons in a crystal slab containing $N_T$ V-type three-level atoms. Based on symmetric quasi-spin realization of SU(3) in large $N$ limit, the two-mode exciton operators are invoked to depict various collective excitations of the collection of these V-type atoms starting from their ground state. By making use of the rotating wave approximation, the light intensity of radiation for the single lattice layer is investigated in detail. As a quantum coherence effect, the quantum beat phenomenon is discussed in detail for different initial excitonic states. We also test the above results analytically without the consideration of the rotating wave approximation and the self-interaction of radiance field is also included.

We compute numerically the energy levels and wave functions for the system, and show how these may be tuned to make optimal qubits. The dependence of the energy levels on the parameters can be measured spectroscopically, providing an important experimental test for the presence of entangled multiqubit states in Josephson-junction based circuits.

abstract: Small deviations from purely bosonic behavior of trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates are investigated with the help of the quon algebra, which interpolates between bosonic and fermionic statistics. A previously developed formalism is employed to obtain a generalized version of the Gross-Pitaeviskii equation. Two extreme situations are considered, the collapse of the condensate for attractive forces and the depletion of the amount of condensed atoms with repulsive forces. Experimental discrepancies observed in the parameters governing the collapse and the depletion of the condensates can be accounted for by universal fittings of the deformation parameter for each case.

abstract: We study analytically and numerically the one-dimensional quantum Frenkel-Kontorova chain in the regime when the classical model is located in the pinned phase characterized by the gaped phonon excitations and devil's staircase. By extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations we show that for the effective Planck constant $\hbar$ smaller than the critical value $\hbar_c$ the quantum chain is in the pinned instanton glass phase. In this phase the elementary excitations have two branches: phonons, separated from zero energy by a finite gap, and instantons which have an exponentially small excitation energy. At $\hbar=\hbar_c$ the quantum phase transition takes place and for $\hbar>\hbar_c$ the pinned instanton glass is transformed into the sliding phonon gas with gapless phonon excitations. This transition is accompanied by the divergence of the spatial correlation length and appearence of sliding modes at $\hbar>\hbar_c$.

We illustrate how this technique can be used to efficiently ``engineer'' quantum spin systems with desired properties, for specific examples ranging from scalable quantum computation to probing a model with non-trivial topological orders that supports exotic non-abelian anyonic excitations.

abstract: We analyze ground-state properties of strictly one-dimensional molecular matter comprised of identical particles of mass m. Such a class of systems can be described by an additive two-body potential whose functional form is common to all substances which only differ in the energy \epsilon and range l scales of the potential. With this choice De Boer's quantum theorem of corresponding states holds thus implying that ground-state properties expressed in appropriate reduced form are only determined by the dimensionless parameter \lambda_{0}^{2} \sim \hbar^{2}/ml^{2}\epsilon measuring the strength of zero-point motion in the system. The presence of a minimum in the two-body interaction potential leads to a many-body bound state which is a Luttinger liquid. As \lambda_{0} increases, the asymmetry of the two-body potential causes quantum expansion, softening, and eventual evaporation of the Luttinger liquid into a gas phase. Selecting the pair interaction potential in the Morse form we analytically compute the properties of the Luttinger liquid and its range of existence. As lambda_{0} increases, the system first undergoes a discontinuous evaporation transition into a diatomic gas followed by a continuous dissociation transition into a monoatomic gas. In particular we find that spin-polarized isotopes of hydrogen and He-3 are monoatomic gases, He-4 is a diatomic gas, while molecular hydrogen and heavier substances are Luttinger liquids. We also investigate the effect of finite pressure on the properties of the liquid and monoatomic gas phases. In particular we estimate a pressure at which molecular hydrogen undergoes an inverse Peierls transition into a metallic state which is a one-dimensional analog of the transition predicted by Wigner and Huntington in 1935.

abstract: We consider classical and quantum dynamics of a free particle in de Sitter's space-times with different topologies to see what happens to space-time singularities of removable type in quantum theory. We find analytic solution of the classical dynamics. The quantum dynamics is solved by finding an essentially self-adjoint representation of the algebra of observables integrable to the unitary representations of the symmetry group of each considered gravitational system. The dynamics of a massless particle is obtained in the zero-mass limit of the massive case. Our results indicate that taking account of global properties of space-time enables quantization of particle dynamics in all considered cases.

abstract: The algebraic approach to black hole quantization requires the horizon area eigenvalues to be equally spaced. As shown previously, for a neutral non-rotating black hole, such eigenvalues must be $2^{n}$-fold degenerate if one constructs the black hole stationary states by means of a pair of creation operators subject to a specific algebra. We show that the algebra of these two building blocks exhibits $U(2)\equiv U(1)\times SU(2)$ symmetry, where the area operator generates the U(1) symmetry. The three generators of the SU(2) symmetry represent a {\it global} quantum number (hyperspin) of the black hole, and we show that this hyperspin must be zero. As a result, the degeneracy of the $n$-th area eigenvalue is reduced to $2^{n}/n^{3/2}$ for large $n$, and therefore, the logarithmic correction term $-3/2\log A$ should be added to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also provide a heuristic approach explaining this result, and an evidence for the existence of {\it two} building blocks.

We discuss the continuum limit, physical inner product and matrix elements of physical observables to bring out various issues regarding viability of a discrete evolution. We also point out how a continuous time could emerge without appealing to any continuum limit.

abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in a semi-infinite lab ($x > 0$), in the background metric $\ds^2 = u^2(x) (-\dt^2 + \dx^2) + \dy^2 + \dz^2$, are investigated. The resulting equations are studied for the special case $ u(x) = 1 + g x$. It is shown that in the case of zero transverse-momentum, the square of the energy eigenvalues of the spin-1/2 particles are less than the squares of the corresponding eigenvalues of spin-0 particles with same masses, by an amount of $mg\hbar c$. Finally, for nonzero transverse-momentum, the energy eigenvalues corresponding to large quantum numbers are obtained, and the results for spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles are compared to each other.

abstract: Results of an experimental search for new macroscopic forces with Yukawa range between 5 and 500 microns are presented. The experiment uses 1 kHz mechanical oscillators as test masses with a stiff conducting shield between them to suppress backgrounds. No signal is observed above the instrumental thermal noise after 22 hours of integration time. These results provide the strongest limits to date between 10 and 100 microns, improve on previous limits by as much as three orders of magnitude, and rule out half of the remaining parameter space for predictions of string-inspired models with low-energy supersymmetry breaking. New forces of four times gravitational strength or greater are excluded at the 95% confidence level for interaction ranges between 200 and 500 microns.

If the oscillator is in a stationary state \psi_q \in W(p) then measurements of the non-commuting Cartesian coordinates of the particle are such that their allowed values are consistent with it being found at a finite number of sites, called ``nests''. These lie on a sphere centered on the origin of fixed, finite radius \varrho_q. The nests themselves are at the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped. In the typical cases (p>2) the number of nests is 8 for q=0 and 3, and varies from 8 to 24, depending on the state, for q=1 and 2. The number of nests is less in the atypical cases (p=1,2), but it is never less than two. In certain states in W(2) (resp. in W(1)) the oscillator is ``polarized'' so that all the nests lie on a plane (resp. on a line). The particle cannot be localized in any one of the available nests alone since the coordinates do not commute. The probabilities of measuring particular values of the coordinates are discussed. The mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the coordinates and momenta are computed, and conclusions are drawn about uncertainty relations. The rotational invariance of the system is also discussed.

abstract: From the covariant bound on the entropy of partial light-sheets, we derive a version of Bekenstein's bound: S/M \leq pi x/hbar, where S, M, and x are the entropy, total mass, and width of any isolated, weakly gravitating system. Because x can be measured along any spatial direction, the bound becomes unexpectedly tight in thin systems. Our result completes the identification of older entropy bounds as special cases of the covariant bound. Thus, light-sheets exhibit a connection between information and geometry far more general, but in no respect weaker, than that initially revealed by black hole thermodynamics.

abstract: Since any fermionic operator \psi can be written as \psi=q+ip, where q and p are hermitian operators, we use the eigenvalues of q and p to construct a functional formalism for calculating matrix elements that involve fermionic fields. The formalism is similar to that for bosonic fields and does not involve Grassmann numbers. This makes possible to perform numerical fermionic lattice computations that are much faster than not only other algorithms for fermions, but also algorithms for bosons.

abstract: In this paper we establish a relation between Coulomb and oscillator systems on $n$-dimensional spheres and hyperboloids for $n\geq 2$. We show that, as in Euclidean space, the quasiradial equation for the $n+1$ dimensional Coulomb problem coincides with the $2n$-dimensional quasiradial oscillator equation on spheres and hyperboloids. Using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for the oscillator system, we construct the energy spectrum and wave functions for the Coulomb problem.

abstract: Previously, Bennet and Feynman asked if Heisenberg's uncertainty principle puts a limitation on a quantum computer (Quantum Mechanical Computers, Richard P. Feynman, Foundations of Physics, Vol. 16, No. 6, p597-531, 1986). Feynman's answer was negative. In this paper, we will revisit the same question for the discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle. We will show that the discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle plays a fundamental role in showing that Shor's type of quantum algorithms has efficient running time and conclude that the discrete time uncertainty principle is an aid in our current formulation and understanding of Shor's type of quantum algorithms. It turns out that for these algorithms, the probability of measuring an element in some set $T$ (at the end of the algorithm) can be written in terms of the time-limiting and band-limiting operators from finite Fourier analysis. Associated with these operators is the finite Fourier transform uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle provides a lower bound for the above probability. We will derive lower bounds for these types of probabilities in general. We will call these lower bounds quantum algorithm uncertainty principles or QAUP. QAUP are important because they give us some sense of the probability of measuring something desirable. We will use these lower bounds to derive Shor's factoring and discrete log algorithms.

abstract: It is shown that the one-lens system in para-axial optics can serve as an optical computer for contraction of Wigner's little groups and an analogue computer which transforms analytically computations on a spherical surface to those on a hyperbolic surface. It is shown possible to construct a set of Lorentz transformations which leads to a two-by-two matrix whose expression is the same as those in the para-axial lens optics. It is shown that the lens focal condition corresponds to the contraction of the O(3)-like little group for a massive particle to the E(2)-like little group for a massless particle, and also to the contraction of the O(2,1)-like little group for a space-like particle to the same E(2)-like little group. The lens-focusing transformations presented in this paper allow us to continue analytically the spherical O(3) world to the hyperbolic O(2,1) world, and vice versa.

abstract: We study dynamics of the atom-photon interaction in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), considering a cold two-level atom in a single-mode high-finesse standing-wave cavity as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system with three coupled degrees of freedom: translational, internal atomic, and the field. The system proves to have different types of motion including L\'{e}vy flights and chaotic walkings of an atom in a cavity. It is shown that the translational motion, related to the atom recoils, is governed by an equation of a parametric nonlinear pendulum with a frequency modulated by the Rabi oscillations. This type of dynamics is chaotic with some width of the stochastic layer that is estimated analytically. The width is fairly small for realistic values of the control parameters, the normalized detuning $\delta$ and atomic recoil frequency $\alpha$. It is demonstrated how the atom-photon dynamics with a given value of $\alpha$ depends on the values of $\delta$ and initial conditions. Two types of L\'{e}vy flights, one corresponding to the ballistic motion of the atom and another one corresponding to small oscillations in a potential well, are found. These flights influence statistical properties of the atom-photon interaction such as distribution of Poincar\'{e} recurrences and moments of the atom position $x$. The simulation shows different regimes of motion, from slightly abnormal diffusion with $<x^2>\sim\tau^{1.13}$ at $\delta =1.2$ to a superdiffusion with $<x^2> \sim \tau^{2.2}$ at $\delta=1.92$ that corresponds to a superballistic motion of the atom with an acceleration. The obtained results can be used to find new ways to manipulate atoms, to cool and trap them by adjusting the detuning $\delta$.

abstract: Exploiting the similarities between the Helmholtz wave equation and the Klein-Gordon equation, the former is linearized using the Feschbach-Villars procedure used for linearizing the Klein-Gordon equation. Then the Foldy-Wouthuysen iterative diagonalization technique is applied to obtain a Hamiltonian description for a system with varying refractive index. Besides reproducing all the traditional quasiparaxial terms, this method leads to additional terms, which are dependent on the wavelength, in the optical Hamiltonian. This alternate prescription to obtain the aberration expansion is applied to the axially symmetric graded index fiber. This results in the wavelength-dependent modification of the paraxial behaviour and the aberration coefficients. Explicit expression for the modified coefficients of the aberration to third-order are presented. Sixth and eighth order Hamiltonians are derived for this system.

abstract: We present a new formalism for light beam optics starting with an exact eight-dimensional matrix representation of the Maxwell equations. The Foldy-Wouthuysen iterative diagonalization technique is employed to obtain a Hamiltonian description for a system with varying refractive index. Besides, reproducing all the traditional quasiparaxial terms, this method leads to additional contributions, which are dependent on the wavelength, in the optical Hamiltonian. This alternate prescription to obtain the aberration expansion is applied to the axially symmetric graded index fiber. This results in the wavelength-dependent modifications of the paraxial behaviour and the aberration coefficients. Furthermore it predicts a wavelength-dependent image rotation. In the low wavelength limit our formalism reproduces the Lie algebraic formalism of optics. The Foldy-Wouthuysen technique employed by us is ideally suited for the Lie algebraic approach to optics. The present study further strengthens the close analogy between the various prescription of light and charged-particle optics. All the associated machinery used in this formalism is described in the text and the accompanying appendices.

abstract: The close analogy between geometrical optics and the classical theories of charged-particle beam optics have been known for a very long time. In recent years, quantum theories of charged-particle beam optics have been presented with the very expected feature of wavelength-dependent effects. With the current development of non-traditional prescriptions of Helmholtz and Maxwell optics respectively, accompanied with the wavelength-dependent effects, it is seen that the analogy between the two systems persists. A brief account of the various prescriptions and the parallel of the analogies is presented.

abstract: We study the propagation of electromagnetic pulses through photonic bandgap materials and relate time-domain pulse reshaping to observable transit times. For layered dielectric mirrors we demonstrate how pulse reshaping of slowly varying classical fields results in transit-time delays that are equivalent to the group delay. The time-domain analysis emphasizes the causal origin of negative group delays. We also study an analogous fully-quantized model and show how the same time-domain analysis may be used to interpret observed delays of single-photon fields.

abstract: We examine collective magnetoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), focusing on rapid adiabatic passage from atoms to molecules induced by a sweep of the magnetic field across a wide (>~ 10 G) Feshbach resonance in 85Rb. This problem raises an interest because strong magnetoassociation is expected to favor the creation of molecular-dissociated atom pairs over the formation of molecular BEC [Javanainen and Mackie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 090403 (2002)]. Nevertheless, the conversion to atom pairs is found to depend on the direction of the sweep, so that a system initially above threshold (open dissociation channel) may in fact give near-complete conversion to molecules.
