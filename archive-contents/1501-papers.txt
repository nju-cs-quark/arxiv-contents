abstract: Quantum computing is a good way to justify difficult physics experiments. But until quantum computers are built, do computer scientists need to know anything about quantum information? In fact, quantum computing is not merely a recipe for new computing devices, but a new way of looking at the world that has been astonishingly intellectually productive. In this article, I'll talk about where quantum computing came from, what it is, and what we can learn from it.

abstract: We present two parallel repetition theorems for the entangled value of multi-player, one-round free games (games where the inputs come from a product distribution). Our first theorem shows that for a $k$-player free game $G$ with entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \epsilon$, the $n$-fold repetition of $G$ has entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n})$ at most $(1 - \epsilon^{3/2})^{\Omega(n/sk^4)}$, where $s$ is the answer length of any player. In contrast, the best known parallel repetition theorem for the classical value of two-player free games is $\mathrm{val}(G^{\otimes n}) \leq (1 - \epsilon^2)^{\Omega(n/s)}$, due to Barak, et al. (RANDOM 2009). This suggests the possibility of a separation between the behavior of entangled and classical free games under parallel repetition. Our second theorem handles the broader class of free games $G$ where the players can output (possibly entangled) quantum states. For such games, the repeated entangled value is upper bounded by $(1 - \epsilon^2)^{\Omega(n/sk^2)}$. We also show that the dependence of the exponent on $k$ is necessary: we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n \geq 1$ such that $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n}) \geq \mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$. Our analysis exploits the novel connection between communication protocols and quantum parallel repetition, first explored by Chailloux and Scarpa (ICALP 2014). We demonstrate that better communication protocols yield better parallel repetition theorems: our first theorem crucially uses a quantum search protocol by Aaronson and Ambainis, which gives a quadratic speed-up for distributed search problems. Finally, our results apply to a broader class of games than were previously considered before; in particular, we obtain the first parallel repetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players, and for games involving quantum outputs.

abstract: Classical simulations of noisy stabilizer circuits are often used to estimate the threshold of a quantum error-correcting code. Physical noise sources are efficiently approximated by random insertions of Pauli operators. For a single qubit, more accurate approximations that still allow for efficient simulation can be obtained by including Clifford operators and Pauli operators conditional on measurement in the noise model. We examine the feasibility of employing these expanded error approximations to obtain better threshold estimates. We calculate the level-1 pseudothreshold for the Steane [[7,1,3]] code for amplitude damping and dephasing along a non-Clifford axis. The expanded channels estimate the actual channel action more accurately than the Pauli channels before error correction. However, after error correction, the Pauli twirling approximation yields very accurate estimates of the performance of quantum error-correcting protocols in the presence of the actual noise channel.

abstract: The ability to perform quantum error correction is a significant hurdle for scalable quantum information processing. A key requirement for multiple-round quantum error correction is the ability to dynamically extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Heat-bath algorithmic cooling is a method that uses quantum logic operations to move entropy from one subsystem to another, and permits cooling of a spin qubit below the closed system (Shannon) bound. Gamma-irradiated, $^{13}$C-labeled malonic acid provides up to 5 spin qubits: 1 spin-half electron and 4 spin-half nuclei. The nuclei are strongly hyperfine coupled to the electron and can be controlled either by exploiting the anisotropic part of the hyperfine interaction or by using pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques. The electron connects the nuclei to a heat-bath with a much colder effective temperature determined by the electron's thermal spin polarization. By accurately determining the full spin Hamiltonian and performing realistic algorithmic simulations, we show that an experimental demonstration of heat-bath algorithmic cooling beyond the Shannon bound is feasible in both 3-qubit and 5-qubit variants of this spin system. Similar techniques could be useful for polarizing nuclei in molecular or crystalline systems that allow for non-equilibrium optical polarization of the electron spin.

abstract: We analyze an efficient frequency estimation scheme that is applied to measure the unknown frequency of an atomic state in Ramsey spectroscopy. The scheme is employing appropriate combinations of uncorrelated probe atoms and Greenburgur-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type correlated probe atoms to estimate its frequency. The estimation value of frequency is obtained through the Bayesian analysis of the final measurement outcomes. The proposed scheme allows us to obtain better precision than the scheme without quantum correlation and it also prevents us from ambiguity in the frequency estimation procedure with GHZ correlations only. We show that the scheme can beat the shot-noise limit and, in addition, it is found that there is the trade-off relation between the precision of the frequency estimation and the decoherence rate in the atomic states.

abstract: This is the first in a pair of articles that classify the configuration space and kinematic symmetry groups for $N$ identical particles in one-dimensional traps experiencing Galilean-invariant two-body interactions. These symmetries explain degeneracies in the few-body spectrum and demonstrate how tuning the trap shape and the particle interactions can manipulate these degeneracies. The additional symmetries that emerge in the non-interacting limit and in the unitary limit of an infinitely strong contact interaction are sufficient to algebraically solve for the spectrum and degeneracy in terms of the one-particle observables. Symmetry also determines the degree to which the algebraic expressions for energy level shifts by weak interactions or nearly-unitary interactions are universal, i.e.\ independent of trap shape and details of the interaction. Identical fermions and bosons with and without spin are considered. This article sequentially analyzes the symmetries of one, two and three particles in asymmetric, symmetric, and harmonic traps; the sequel article treats the $N$ particle case.

The relation of our work to the usual theory of quantum noise and damping is briefly discussed.

abstract: The spin dynamics of radical-triplet system (RTS) has been calculated by using the Lindblad formalism within the theory of open quantum system. The single-radical-triplet system (SRTS) is considered here for single-qubit quantum gate operations while double-radical-triplet system (DRTS) for two-qubit operations. The environment effects taken into account include the spin-lattice relaxation of the triplet exciton and radical spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, the inter-system crossing process that induces the transition from singlet excited state to the triplet ground state, and the rather slow relaxation process from the triplet ground state back down to the singlet ground state. These calculations shown that the line shape broadening is strongly related to the exchange interaction between triplet and exciton, which can be understood as a spontaneous magnetic field created by the triplet renormalises the original spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ electron spin resonance spectra. This work will provide key information about the spin dynamics for building optically-controlled molecular quantum gate out of radical-bearing molecules. Moreover, this has generated the further theoretical question on how the mixture of fermion and boson behaves.

abstract: We introduce a tight-binding chain with a single impurity to act as a quantum data bus for perfect quantum state transfer. Our proposal is based on the weak coupling limit of the two outermost quantum dots to the data bus. First show that the data bus has an energy gap between the ground and first-excited states in the single-particle case induced by the impurity in the single particle case. By connecting two quantum dots to two sites of the data bus, the system can accomplish a high-fidelity and long-distance quantum state transfer. Numerical simulations were performed for a finite system; the results show that the numerical and analytical results of the effective coupling strength agree well with each other. Moreover, we study the robustness of this quantum communication protocol in the presence of disorder in the couplings between the nearest-neighbor quantum dots. We find that the gap of the system plays an important role in robust quantum state transfer.

abstract: We study the effect of PT-symmetric complex potentials on the transport properties of non-Hermitian systems, which consist of an infinite linear chain and two side-coupled defect points with PT-symmetric complex on-site potentials. By analytically solving the scattering problem of two typical models, which display standard Fano resonances in the absence of non-Hermitian terms, we find that the PT-symmetric imaginary potentials can lead to some pronounced effects on transport properties of our systems, including changes from the perfect reflection to perfect transmission, and rich behaviors for the absence or existence of the prefect reflection at one and two resonant frequencies. Our study can help us to understand the interplay between the Fano resonance and PT symmetry in non-Hermitian discrete systems, which may be realizable in optical waveguide experiments.

abstract: We propose to produce five-partite entanglement via cascaded four-wave mixing in a high-Q microresonator that may become a key to future one-way quantum computation on chip. A theoretical model is presented for the underlying continuous-variable entanglement among the generated comb modes that is expansible to more complicated scenarios. We analyze the entanglement condition when the van Loock and Furusawa criteria are violated, and discuss the device parameters for potential experimental realization that may be utilized to build an integrated compact five-partite entanglement generator. The proposed approach exhibits great potential for future large-scale integrated full optical quantum computation on chip.

abstract: Quantum machine learning has received significant attention in recent years, and promising progress has been made in the development of quantum algorithms to speed up traditional machine learning tasks. In this work, however, we focus on investigating the information-theoretic upper bounds of sample complexity - how many training samples are sufficient to predict the future behaviour of an unknown target function. This kind of problem is, arguably, one of the most fundamental problems in statistical learning theory and the bounds for practical settings can be completely characterised by a simple measure of complexity. Our main result in the paper is that, for learning an unknown quantum measurement, the upper bound, given by the fat-shattering dimension, is linearly proportional to the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space. Learning an unknown quantum state becomes a dual problem to ours, and as a byproduct, we can recover Aaronson's famous result [Proc. R. Soc. A 463:3089-3144 (2007)] solely using a classical machine learning technique. In addition, other famous complexity measures like covering numbers and Rademacher complexities are derived explicitly. We are able to connect measures of sample complexity with various areas in quantum information science, e.g. quantum state/measurement tomography, quantum state discrimination and quantum random access codes, which may be of independent interest. Lastly, with the assistance of general Bloch-sphere representation, we show that learning quantum measurements/states can be mathematically formulated as a neural network. Consequently, classical ML algorithms can be applied to efficiently accomplish the two quantum learning tasks.

abstract: In this review, we briefly overview recent works on hybrid (nano) opto-mechanical systems that contain both mechanical oscillators and diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. We review two different types of mechanical oscillators. The first one is a clamped mechanical oscillator, such as a cantilever, with a fixed frequency. The second one is an optically trapped nano-diamond with a build-in nitrogen-vacancy center. By coupling mechanical resonators with electron spins, we can use the spins to control the motion of mechanical oscillators. For the first setup, we discuss two different coupling mechanisms which are magnetic coupling and strain induced coupling. We summarize their applications such as cooling the mechanical oscillator, generating entanglements between NV centers, squeezing spin ensembles and et al. For the second setup, we discuss how to generate quantum superposition states with magnetic coupling, and realize matter wave interferometer. We will also review its applications as ultra-sensitive mass spectrometer. Finally, we discuss new coupling mechanisms and applications of the field.

abstract: The standard Bloch sphere representation was recently generalized to the 'extended Bloch representation' describing not only systems of arbitrary dimension, but also their measurements. This model solves the measurement problem and is based on the 'hidden-measurement interpretation', according to which the Born rule results from our lack of knowledge about the interaction between measuring apparatus and the measured entity. We present here the extended Bloch model and use it to investigate the nature of quantum spin and its relation to our Euclidean space. We show that spin eigenstates cannot generally be associated with directions in the Euclidean space, but only with generalized directions in the Blochean space, which generally is a space of higher dimension. Hence, spin entities have to be considered as genuine non-spatial entities. We also show, however, that specific vectors can be identified in the Blochean theater that are isomorphic to the Euclidean space directions, and therefore representative of them, and that spin eigenstates always have a predetermined orientation with respect to them. We use the details of our results to put forward a new view of realism, that we call 'multiplex realism', providing a specific framework with which to interpret the human observations and understanding of the component parts of the world. Elements of reality can be represented in different theaters, one being our customary Euclidean space, and another one the quantum realm, revealed to us through our sophisticated experiments, whose elements of reality, in the quantum jargon, are the eigenvalues and eigenstates. Our understanding of the component parts of the world can then be guided by looking for the possible connections, in the form of partial morphisms, between the different representations, which is precisely what we do in this article with regard to spin entities.

abstract: This paper presents LEQA, a fast latency estimation tool for evaluating the performance of a quantum algorithm mapped to a quantum fabric. The actual quantum algorithm latency can be computed by performing detailed scheduling, placement and routing of the quantum instructions and qubits in a quantum operation dependency graph on a quantum circuit fabric. This is, however, a very expensive proposition that requires large amounts of processing time. Instead, LEQA, which is based on computing the neighborhood population counts of qubits, can produce estimates of the circuit latency with good accuracy (i.e., an average of less than 3% error) with up to two orders of magnitude speedup for mid-size benchmarks. This speedup is expected to increase superlinearly as a function of circuit size (operation count).

abstract: The normalized separable states of a finite-dimensional multipartite quantum system, represented by its Hilbert space $\cal H$, form a closed convex set ${\cal S}_1$. There are two kinds of faces, the induced and non-induced ones. The induced face, $E$, has the form $F=\Gamma(F_V)$, where $V$ is a subspace of $\cal H$, $F_V$ is the set of $\rho\in{\cal S}_1$ whose range is contained in $V$, and $\Gamma$ is a partial transposition operator. Such $F$ is a maximal face if and only if $V$ is a hyperplane. We give a simple formula for the dimension of any induced maximal face. We also prove that the maximum dimension of induced maximal faces is equal to $d(d-2)$ where $d$ is the dimension of $\cal H$. The equality $\dim\Gamma(F_V)=d(d-2)$ holds if and only if $V^\perp$ is spanned by a genuinely entangled vector.

abstract: We construct three-qubit entanglement witnesses with the properties that all the partial transposes have the spanning properties. These witnesses determine faces for separable states whose interior lies in the interior of PPT states, and so they detect sets of PPT entangled states with nonempty interiors. These witnesses also detect all kinds of bi-separable pure product states. Our construction depends on the observation that multi-partite entanglement witnesses correspond to multi-linear maps which are positive.

We further study an asymmetric strategy in distributing an ECS over a lossy environment and find that such a scheme can significantly increase violation of the inequality.

abstract: We study the closeness of an experimental unitary bosonic network with only partially indistinguishable bosons in an arbitrary mixed input state, in particular an experimental realization of the Boson Sampling, to the ideal bosonic network, where the measure of closeness of two networks is the trace distance between the output probability distributions. An upper bound on the trace distance to the ideal bosonic network is proven and also a bound on the difference between probabilities of an output configuration. Moreover, the upper bound on the trace distance is tight, provided that a physically transparent distinguishability conjecture is true. For a small distinguishability error it is shown that a realistic device with $N$ bosons is at a constant trace distance to the ideal Boson Sampling under the $O(N^{-1})$-scaling of the mismatch of internal states of bosons.

abstract: Two-color second-order correlations of the light scattered near-resonantly by a quantum dot were measured by means of spectrally-filtered coincidence detection. The effects of filter frequency and bandwidth were studied under monochromatic laser excitation, and a complete two-photon spectrum was reconstructed. In contrast to the ordinary one-photon spectrum, the two-photon spectrum is asymmetric with laser detuning and exhibits a rich structure associated with both real and virtual two-photon transitions down the "dressed states" ladder. Photon pairs generated via virtual transitions are found to violate the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality by a factor of 60. Our experiments are well described by the theoretical expressions obtained by del Valle et al. via time-and normally-ordered correlation functions.

Here we consider the tripartite hybrid system as a pair of non interacting two qutrits initially prepared in bound entangled states and one auxiliary qubit. The auxiliary qubit interacts with any one of the qutrit of the pair through DM interaction. It has been found that the DM interaction free the bound entangled states as time advances. In the present work we consider two types of bound entangled states investigated by Horodecki. Further we ?nd that the frequency of free entanglement conversion is same in both the states. We also investigate the phenomenon of entanglement and distillability sudden death and their possibilities. Here the realignment criteria and negativity have been used for detection and quanti?cation of entanglement.

title: Toward a thermo-hydrodynamic like description of Schrodinger equation via the Madelung formulation and Fisher information

comments: 11 pages. V.2 includes a new derivation of an equivalent "first law of thermodynamics" for the quantum fluid
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00944
abstract: We revisit the analogy suggested by Madelung between a non-relativistic time-dependent quantum particle, to a fluid system which is pseudo-barotropic, irrotational and inviscid. We first discuss the hydrodynamical properties of the Madelung description in general, and extract a pressure like term from the Bohm potential. We also point out that incompressibility of the fluid implies conservation of density along a fluid parcel trajectory and in 1D this immediately results in the non-spreading property of wave packets, as the sum of Bohm potential and an exterior potential must be either constant or linear in space. Next we relate to the hydrodynamic description a thermodynamic counterpart, taking the classical behavior of an adiabatic barotopric flow as a reference. We show that while the Bohm potential is not a positive definite quantity, its expectation value is proportional to the Fisher information whose integrand is positive definite. Moreover, this integrand is exactly equal to half of the square of the imaginary part of the momentum. This suggests a relation between the Fisher information and the thermodynamic like internal energy of the Madelung fluid. Furthermore, it provides a physical linkage between the inverse of the Fisher information and the measure of disorder in quantum systems - in spontaneous adiabatic gas expansion the amount of disorder increases while the internal energy decreases. The limitations of this thermodynamic description are considered in more details as the Bohm potential cannot be expressed in terms of the fluid enthalpy, which could have been expected from the analogy to classical fluids. Moreover, the pressure like term is defined up to a time dependent gauge function, and if we ignore the latter we obtain a counter-intuitive "thermodynamic first law" in which the work performed by the pressure to expand a fluid parcel increases its internal energy.

abstract: Application of multiple rounds of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is an essential milestone towards the construction of scalable quantum information processing devices. However, experimental realizations of it are still in their infancy. The requirements for multiple round QEC are high control fidelity and the ability to extract entropy from ancilla qubits. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based quantum devices have demonstrated high control fidelity with up to 12 qubits. On the other hand, the major challenge in the NMR QEC experiment is to efficiently supply ancilla qubits in highly pure states at the beginning of each round of QEC. Purification of qubits in NMR, or in other ensemble based quantum systems can be accomplished through Heat Bath Algorithmic Cooling (HBAC). It is an efficient method for extracting entropy from qubits that interact with a heat bath, allowing cooling below the bath temperature. For practical HBAC, coupled electron-nuclear spin systems are more promising than conventional NMR quantum processors, since electron spin polarization is about $10^3$ times greater than that of a proton under the same experimental conditions. We provide an overview on both theoretical and experimental aspects of HBAC focusing on spin and magnetic resonance based systems, and discuss the prospects of exploiting electron-nuclear coupled systems for the realization of HBAC and multiple round QEC.

abstract: We propose and analyze heralded quantum gates between qubits in optical cavities. They employ an auxiliary qubit to report if a successful gate occurred. In this manner, the errors, which would have corrupted a deterministic gate, are converted into a non-unity probability of success: once successful the gate has a much higher fidelity than a similar deterministic gate. Specifically, we describe that a heralded , near-deterministic controlled phase gate (CZ-gate) with the conditional error arbitrarily close to zero and the success probability that approaches unity as the cooperativity of the system, C, becomes large. Furthermore, we describe an extension to near-deterministic N- qubit Toffoli gate with a favorable error scaling. These gates can be directly employed in quantum repeater networks to facilitate near-ideal entanglement swapping, thus greatly speeding up the entanglement distribution.

title: A delayed choice quantum eraser explained by the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics
authors: H. Fearn
comments: 16 pages 4 figures, fourth draft

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: This paper explains the delayed choice quantum eraser of Kim et al. in terms of the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics by John Cramer. It is kept deliberately mathematically simple to help explain the transactional technique. The emphasis is on a clear understanding of how the instantaneous "collapse" of the wave function due to a measurement at a specific time and place may be reinterpreted as a gradual collapse over the entire path of the photon and over the entire transit time from slit to detector. This is made possible by the use of a retarded offer wave, which is thought to travel from the slits (or rather the small region within the parametric crystal where down-conversion takes place) to the detector and an advanced counter wave traveling backward in time from the detector to the slits. The point here is to make clear how simple the Cramer transactional picture is and how much more intuitive the collapse of the wave function becomes if viewed in this way. Also any confusion about possible retro-causal signaling is put to rest. A delayed choice quantum eraser does not require any sort of backward in time communication. This paper makes the point that it is preferable to use the Transactional Interpretation (TI) over the usual Copenhagen Interpretation (CI) for a more intuitive understanding of the quantum eraser delayed choice experiment. Both methods give exactly the same end results and can be used interchangeably.

abstract: We study the dynamics of a general quartic interaction Hamiltonian under the influence of dissipation and non-classical driving. In this scenario, we show that an effective Hartree-type decoupling yields a good approximation to the dynamics of the system. We find that the stationary states are squeezed vacuum states of the non-interacting system which are enhanced by the Q-factor of the cavity. We show that this effective interaction could be realised with a cascaded superconducting cavity-qubit system in the strong dispersive regime in a setup similar to recent experiments. The qubit non-linearity, therefore, does not significantly influence the highly squeezed intracavity microwave field but, for a range of parameters, enables quantum state tomography of the cavity.

abstract: We analyze one of the fundamental models of decoherence and quantum-to-classical transition---Quantum Brownian Motion, and show formation of a, so called, spectrum broadcast structure. As recently shown, this is a specific structure of multi-partite quantum states responsible for appearance of classical objective features in quantum mechanics. Working in the limit of a very massive central system and in a weak-coupling regime, we derive a surprising time-evolving, rather than time-asymptotic, spectrum broadcast structure, leading to perceived objectivity of a state of motion. We do it for realistic, noisy random environment, modeled as a thermal bath, and present some generalization to arbitrary single-mode Gaussian states. We study numerically the formation of the spectrum broadcast structure as a function of the temperature, showing its certain noise-robustness.

abstract: Quantum number-path entanglement is a resource for super-sensitive quantum metrology and in particular provides for sub-shotnoise or even Heisenberg-limited sensitivity. However, such number-path entanglement has thought to have been resource intensive to create in the first place --- typically requiring either very strong nonlinearities, or nondeterministic preparation schemes with feed-forward, which are difficult to implement. Very recently, arising from the study of quantum random walks with multi-photon walkers, as well as the study of the computational complexity of passive linear optical interferometers fed with single-photon inputs, it has been shown that such passive linear optical devices generate a superexponentially large amount of number-path entanglement. A logical question to ask is whether this entanglement may be exploited for quantum metrology. We answer that question here in the affirmative by showing that a simple, passive, linear-optical interferometer --- fed with only uncorrelated, single-photon inputs, coupled with simple, single-mode, disjoint photodetection --- is capable of significantly beating the shotnoise limit. Our result implies a pathway forward to practical quantum metrology with readily available technology.

abstract: A free particle is constrained to move on a knot obtained by winding around a putative torus. The classical equations of motion for this system are solved in a closed form. The exact energy eigenspectrum, in the thin torus limit, is obtained by mapping the time-independent Schrodinger equation to the Mathieu equation. In the general case, the eigenvalue problem is described by the Hill equation. Finite-thickness corrections are incorporated perturbatively by truncating the Hill equation. Comparisons and contrasts between this problem and the well-studied problem of a particle on a circle (planar rigid rotor) are performed throughout.

abstract: We study the dynamics of four-qubit W state under various noisy environments by solving analytically the master equation in the Lindblad form in which the Lindblad operators correspond to the Pauli matrices and describe the decoherence of states. Also, we investigate the dynamics of the entanglement using the lower bound to the concurrence. It is found that while the entanglement decreases monotonically for Pauli-Z noise, it decays suddenly for other three noises. Moreover, by studying the time evolution of entanglement of various maximally entangled four-qubit states, we indicate that the four-qubit W state is more robust under same-axis Pauli channels. Furthermore, three-qubit W state preserves more entanglement with respect to the four-qubit W state, except for the Pauli-Z noise.

abstract: A scheme for control and read-out of diffracted spins waves to propagating light fields is presented. Diffraction is obtained via sinusoidally varying lights shifts and ideal one-to-one mapping to light is realized using a gradient echo quantum memory. We also show that dynamical control of the diffracted spin waves spatial orders can be implemented to realize a quantum pulse sequencer for temporal modes that have high time-bandwidth products. Full numerical solutions suggest that both co-propagating and couterpropagating light shift geometries can be used, making the proposal applicable to hot and cold atomic vapours as well as solid state systems with two-level atoms.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01287
abstract: We reexamine the thought experiment and real experiment of Vaidman et al., by placing Dove prisms in the nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer arms. In those previous works, the criterion of whether a single photon was present, or not, was the presence of a "weak trace", indicating the presence of a nonzero weak value. This was verified by slightly varying the mirror angle at a given frequency, which was then detected on a position sensitive detector at the oscillation frequency. We show the presence of the Dove prisms gives identical weak values everywhere to the previous configuration because the prisms change neither the path difference, nor the mode profile in the aligned case. Nevertheless, the same slight variations of the interferometer mirrors now give a signal at the first mirror of the nested interferometer. We can interpret this result as a misaligned optical interferometer, whose detailed response depends on the stability of the elements, or as the detector coupling to a nonzero effective weak value.

abstract: Quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry map the dynamics of electrons in a molecule to the dynamics of a coupled spin system. To reach chemical accuracy for interesting molecules, a large number of quantum gates must be applied which implies the need for quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation. Arbitrary fault-tolerant operations can be constructed from a small, universal set of fault-tolerant operations by gate compilation. Quantum chemistry algorithms are compiled by decomposing the dynamics of the coupled spin-system using a Trotter formula, synthesizing the decomposed dynamics using Clifford operations and single-qubit rotations, and finally approximating the single-qubit rotations by a sequence of fault-tolerant single-qubit gates. Certain fault-tolerant gates rely on the preparation of specific single-qubit states referred to as magic states. As a result, gate compilation and magic state distillation are critical for solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. We review recent progress that has improved the efficiency of gate compilation and magic state distillation by orders of magnitude.

abstract: The distinct methods for measuring topological charge in a non-abelian anyonic system have been discussed in the literature: projective measurement of a single point-like quasiparticle and interferometric measurement of the total topological charge of a group of quasiparticles. Projective measurement by definition is only applied near a point and will project to a topological charge sector near that point. Thus, if it is to be applied to a \emph{group} of anyons to project to a \emph{total} charge, then the anyons must first be fused one by one to obtain a single anyon carrying the collective charge. We show that interferometric measurement is strictly stronger: Any protocol involving projective measurement can be simulated at low overhead by another protocol involving only interferometric measurement.

abstract: Laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors implement Fabry-Perot cavities to increase their peak sensitivity. However, this is at cost of reducing their detection bandwidth, which origins from the propagation phase delay of the light. The "white-light-cavity" idea, first proposed by Wicht et al. [Optics Communications 134, 431 (1997)], is to circumvent this limitation by introducing anomalous dispersion, using double-pumped gain medium, to compensate for such phase delay. In this article, starting from the Hamiltonian of atom-light interaction, we apply the input-output formalism to evaluate the quantum noise of the system. We find that apart from the additional noise associated with the parametric amplification process noticed by others, the stability condition for the entire system poses an additional constraint. Through surveying the parameter regimes where the gain medium remains stable (not lasing) and stationary, we find that there is no net enhancement of the shot-noise limited sensitivity. Therefore, other gain mediums or different parameter regimes shall be explored for realizing the white light cavity.

abstract: Quantum computing exploits fundamentally new models of computation based on quantum mechanical properties instead of classical physics, and it is believed that quantum computers are able to dramatically improve computational power for particular tasks. At present, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been one of the most successful platforms amongst all current implementations. It has demonstrated universal controls on the largest number of qubits, and many advanced techniques developed in NMR have been adopted to other quantum systems successfully. In this review, we show how NMR quantum processors can satisfy the general requirements of a quantum computer, and describe advanced techniques developed towards this target. Additionally, we review some recent NMR quantum processor experiments. These experiments include benchmarking protocols, quantum error correction, demonstrations of algorithms exploiting quantum properties, exploring the foundations of quantum mechanics, and quantum simulations. Finally we summarize the concepts and comment on future prospects.

abstract: Many typical Bell experiments can be described as follows. A source repeatedly distributes particles among two spacelike separated observers. Each of them makes a measurement, using an observable randomly chosen out of several possible ones, leading to one of two possible outcomes. After collecting a sufficient amount of data one calculates the value of a so-called Bell expression. An important question in this context is whether the result is compatible with bounds based on the assumptions of locality, realism and freedom of choice. Here we are interested in bounds on the obtained value derived from quantum theory, so-called Tsirelson bounds. We describe a simple Tsirelson bound, which is based on a singular value decomposition. This mathematical result leads to some physical insights. In particular the optimal observables can be obtained. Furthermore statements about the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space are possible. Finally, Bell inequalities can be modified to match rotated measurement settings, e.g. if the two parties do not share a common reference frame.

In spite of causality, it is well known, according to the Reeh-Schlieder theorem, that it is possible for relativistic quantum field theories, and a "physical" process achieving this task, involving superoscillatory functions, has recently been introduced. In this work we deal with non-relativistic fields, and show that remote state preparation is also possible for them, hence generalizing the Reeh-Schlieder theorem.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering demonstrates that two parties share entanglement even if the measurement devices of one party are untrusted. Here, going beyond this bipartite concept, we develop a novel formalism to explore a large class of EPR steering from generic multipartite quantum systems of arbitrarily high dimensionality and degrees of freedom, such as graph states and hyperentangled systems. All of these quantum characteristics of genuine high-order EPR steering can be efficiently certified with few measurement settings in experiments. We faithfully demonstrate for the first time such generality by experimentally showing genuine four-partite EPR steering and applications to universal one-way quantum computing. Our formalism provides a new insight into the intermediate type of genuine multipartite Bell non-locality and potential applications to quantum of untrusted measurement devices.

abstract: We propose a practical scheme of satellite-based quantum clock synchronization with atmospheric dispersion cancellation and by taking into account spacetime background of the Earth. Two frequency entangled pulses are employed to synchronize two clocks, one at a ground station and the other at a satellite. The time discrepancy of the two clocks is introduced into the pulses by moving mirrors and is extracted by measuring the coincidence rate of the pulses in the interferometer. We find that the pulses are distorted due to effects of gravity when they propagate between the Earth and the satellite, resulting in coincidence rate are remarkably affected. We also find that the precision of the clock synchronization are sensitive to the source parameters and the altitude of the satellite. Our proposal can be realized with current technology.

abstract: Interfacing photonic and solid-state qubits within a hybrid quantum architecture offers a promising route towards large scale distributed quantum computing. In that respect, hybrid quantum systems combining circuit QED with ions doped into solids are an attractive platform. There, the ions serve as coherent memory elements and reversible conversion elements of microwave to optical qubits. Among many possible spin-doped solids, erbium ions offer the unique opportunity of a coherent conversion of microwave photons into the telecom C-band at $1.54\,\mu$m employed for long distance communication. In our work, we perform a time-resolved electron spin resonance study of an Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ spin ensemble at milli-Kelvin temperatures and demonstrate multimode storage and retrieval of up to 16 coherent microwave pulses. The memory efficiency is measured to be 10$^{-4}$ at the coherence time of $T_2=5.6\,\mu$s.

The short presentation provides a clue how this can be done on the basis of Lorentz covariance while preserving the analyticity of the theory. After deriving with the help of Lorentz covariance a quantum scalar product without making any use of metric or complex conjugation we sketch how the formalism of scattering theory can be extended analytically to a non-Hermitian regime.

abstract: We study quantum protocols among two distrustful parties. By adopting a rather strict definition of correctness - guaranteeing that honest players obtain their correct outcomes only - we can show that every strictly correct quantum protocol implementing a non-trivial classical primitive necessarily leaks information to a dishonest player. This extends known impossibility results to all non-trivial primitives. We provide a framework for quantifying this leakage and argue that leakage is a good measure for the privacy provided to the players by a given protocol. Our framework also covers the case where the two players are helped by a trusted third party. We show that despite the help of a trusted third party, the players cannot amplify the cryptographic power of any primitive. All our results hold even against quantum honest-but-curious adversaries who honestly follow the protocol but purify their actions and apply a different measurement at the end of the protocol. As concrete examples, we establish lower bounds on the leakage of standard universal two-party primitives such as oblivious transfer.

abstract: We demonstrate ground-state cooling of a trapped ion using long-wavelength radiation. This is a powerful tool for the implementation of quantum operations, where long-wavelength radiation instead of lasers is used for motional quantum state engineering. We measure a mean phonon number of $\overline{n} = 0.13(4)$ after sideband cooling, corresponding to a ground-state occupation probability of 88(7)\%. After preparing in the vibrational Fock state $\left|n=0\right\rangle$, we implement sideband Rabi oscillations which last for more than 10 ms, demonstrating the long coherence time of our system. We also use the ability to ground-state cool to accurately measure the motional heating rate and report a reduction by almost two orders of magnitude compared to our previously measured result, which we attribute to carefully eliminating sources of electrical noise in the system.

abstract: We analyze the implications of the violations of the strong Huygens principle in the transmission of information from the early universe to the current era via massless fields. We show that much more information reaches us through timelike channels (not mediated by real photons) than it is carried by rays of light, which are usually regarded as the only carriers of information.

abstract: The entanglement between $SU(2) \otimes SU(2)$ internal degrees of freedom of parity and helicity for reflected and transmitted waves of Dirac-like particles scattered by a potential step along an arbitrary direction on the $x-y$ plane is quantified. Diffusion ($E \geq V$) and Klein zone ($V \geq E$) energy regimes are considered. It has been shown that, for $SU(2) \otimes SU(2)$ polarized structures of helicity eigenstates impinging the barrier, the local interaction with a {\em step} potential destroys the {\em parity-spin} separability. The framework presented here can be straightforwardly translated into a useful theoretical tool for obtaining the {\em spin-spin} entanglement in the context of enlarged scenarios of nonrelativistic $2D$ systems, as for instance those for describing single layer graphene, or even single trapped ions with Dirac bi-spinor mathematical structure.

abstract: We study nonlinear interactions in a strongly driven optomechanical cavity, in regimes where the interactions give rise to resonant scattering between optomechanical polaritons and are thus strongly enhanced. We use a Keldysh formulation and self-consistent perturbation theory, allowing us to include self energy diagrams at all orders in the interaction. Our main focus is understanding how non-equilibrium effects are modified by the polariton interactions, in particular the generation of non-zero effective polariton temperatures from vacuum fluctuations (both in the incident cavity drive and in the mechanical dissipation). We discuss how these effects could be observed in the output spectrum of the cavity. Our work also provides a technical toolkit that will be useful for studies of more complex optomechanical systems.

abstract: We demonstrate that transport characteristics of an arbitrary optical lattice can be greatly-enhanced by modulating the field intensity that generates the lattice structure. We propose, analyze, and derive effective models for two modulation schemes in the strongly interacting limit. For the specific five-site lattices discussed, we numerically predict transport gains ranging from $3\times 10^6$ to roughly $4\times 10^{10}$. After a detailed study of transport optimization in this limit, we discuss the modifications necessary to recover transport for the finite interaction case.

abstract: We present an algorithm for sparse Hamiltonian simulation that has optimal dependence on all parameters of interest (up to log factors). Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity $d$ at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error $\epsilon$. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in $\epsilon$ at the expense of poor scaling in $d$. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm achieves near-linear scaling in $\tau := d \|H\|_{\max} t$ and sublogarithmic scaling in $1/\epsilon$. Our dependence on $\epsilon$ is optimal, and we prove a new lower bound showing that no algorithm can have sublinear dependence on $\tau$.

abstract: Mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs) are generalized from the concept of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and include the complete set of MUBs as a special case, but they are superior to MUBs as they do not need to be rank one projectors. We investigate entanglement detection using sets of MUMs and derived separability criteria for $d$-dimensional multipartite systems, and arbitrary high-dimensional bipartitie and multipartite systems. These criteria provide experimental implementation in detecting entanglement of unknown quantum states.

abstract: Entanglement is well understood concept for distinguishable particles. However fundamental particles are inherently indistinguishable and when they occupy orthogonal modes, i.e. have orthogonal wave functions, they are effectively distinguishable. Thus there should exist a formulation for entanglement which works in the generic case, i.e. even when wave functions overlap. To achieve this, we consider R\`{e}nyi entropies which are measurable quantities. Outcomes of such measurements for a generic case are conjectured in terms of R\`{e}nyi entropies of spatial regions in a field theory. To leading order naive quantum mechanical answers are reproduced. Corrections depend on overlap of wave functions and exhibit novel features. In a generic case the Von Neumann entropy computed from these R\`{e}nyi entropies is argued to be a measure of entanglement of pure states and a formula for this is conjectured in terms of Von Neumann entropies of spatial regions in field theory. It seems, due to the corrections it is possible for the entanglement to exceed "maximal quantum mechanical value", e.g. $log 2$ for a single qubit.

abstract: We present a generalized set of complex rays for a qutrit in terms of parameter $q=e^{i2\pi/k}$, a $k$-th root of unity. Remarkably, when $k=2,3$, the set reduces to two well known state-independent contextuality (SIC) sets: the Yu-Oh set and the Bengtsson-Blanchfield-Cabello set. Based on the Ramanathan-Horodecki criterion and the violation of a noncontextuality inequality, we have proven that the sets with $k=3m$ and $k=4$ are SIC, while the set with $k=5$ is not. Our generalized set of rays will theoretically enrich the study of SIC proof, and experimentally stimulate the novel application to quantum information processing.

abstract: Bloch Oscillations (BOs) of quantum particles manifest themselves as periodic spreading and re-localization of the associated wave functions when traversing lattice potentials subject to external gradient forces. Albeit BOs are deeply rooted into the very foundations of quantum mechanics, all experimental observations of this phenomenon so far have only contemplated dynamics of one or two particles initially prepared in separable local states, which is well described by classical wave physics. Evidently, a more general description of genuinely quantum BOs will be achieved upon excitation of a Bloch-oscillator lattice system by nonlocal states, that is, containing correlations in contradiction with local realism. Here we report the first experimental observation of BOs of two-particle Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen states (EPR), whose associated N-particle wave functions are nonlocal by nature. The time evolution of two-photon EPR states in Bloch-oscillators, whether symmetric, antisymmetric or partially symmetric, reveals unexpected transitions from particle antibunching to bunching. Consequently, the initial state can be tailored to produce spatial correlations akin to bosons, fermions or anyons. These results pave the way for a wider class of photonic quantum simulators.

abstract: We propose a scheme for a quantum thermal machine made by atoms interacting with a single non-equilibrium electromagnetic field. The field is produced by a simple configuration of macroscopic objects held at thermal equilibrium at different temperatures. We show that these machines can deliver all thermodynamic tasks (cooling, heating and population inversion), and this by establishing quantum coherence with the body on which they act. Remarkably, this system allows to reach efficiencies at maximum power very close to the Carnot limit, much more than in existing models. Our findings offer a new paradigm for efficient quantum energy flux management, and can be relevant for both experimental and technological purposes.

abstract: Non-classical multi-photon and number states attracts many people because of their wide applications in fundamental quantum mechanics tests, quantum metrology and quantum computation, therefore it is a longstanding aim to generate such states experimentally. Here, we prepare photon triplets by using the spontaneously Raman scattering process in a hot atomic ensemble cascaded by the spontaneous parametric down conversion process in a periodical poled nonlinear waveguide, the strong temporal correlations of these three photons are observed. Our experiment represents the first combination of the different order nonlinear processes and different physical systems, showing the feasibility of such composite system in this research direction. In addition, the all photons in the prepared genuine triplet are in telecom band make them be suitable for long-distance quantum communication in optical fibre.

The calculation involves first the generation of the Gaussian state and subsequent measurements of two photons a time $\tau \geq 0$ apart. The generation of the Gaussian state by the parametric amplifier insures that the temporal second-order coherence function depends only on $\tau$.

abstract: Since the introduction of the decoy-state technique, phase-randomised weak coherent light pulses have been the key to increase the practicality of quantum-based communications. Their ultra-fast generation was accomplished via compact gain-switched (GS) lasers, leading to high key rates in quantum key distribution (QKD). Recently, the question arose of whether the same laser could be employed to achieve high-speed measurement-device-independent-QKD, a scheme that promises long-haul quantum communications immune to all detector attacks. For that, a challenging highvisibility interference between independent picosecond optical pulses is required. Here, we answer the above question in the affirmative by demonstrating high-visibility interference from two independent GS lasers triggered at 1GHz. The result is obtained through a careful characterization of the laser frequency chirp and time jitter. By relating these quantities to the interference visibility, we obtain a parameter-free verification of the experimental data and a numerical simulation of the achievable key rates. These findings are beneficial to other applications making use of GS lasers, including random number generation and standard QKD.

abstract: Information that is stored in quantum-mechanical systems can be easily lost because of the interaction with the environment in a process known as decoherence. Possible physical implementations of many processes in quantum information theory involve systems of identical particles, whence comprehension of the dynamics of entanglement induced by decoherence processes in identical-particle open systems becomes relevant. Here we study the effects, and concomitant entanglement evolution, arising from the interaction between a system of two identical fermions and the environment, for two paradigmatic quantum channels. New entanglement measures are introduced to quantify the entanglement between the different parties, and a study of the dynamics of entanglement for some particular examples is carried out. Our analysis, which includes also the evolution of an entanglement indicator based on an entropic criteria, offers new insights into the dynamics of entanglement in open systems of identical particles, involving the emergence of multipartite genuine entanglement. The results improve our understanding of the phenomenon of decoherence and will provide new strategies to control it.

The microwaves were applied to the sample using a 3D copper loop-gap resonator and the signal and coupling optical fields were single passed. The conversion efficiency was low, in agreement with a theoretical analysis, but can be significantly enhanced with an optical resonator.

Single site gates are implemented with a focused laser beam to Stark shift the microwaves into resonance at a selected site. At Stark selected single sites we observe $F^2=0.9923(7)$ and an average spin flip crosstalk error at other sites of $0.002(9)$.

abstract: This paper researches how the systematic errors in phase inversions affect the success rate and the number of iterations in optimized quantum random-walk search algorithm. Through geometric description of this algorithm, the model of the algorithm with phase errors is established and the relationship between the success rate of the algorithm, the database size, the number of iterations and the phase error is depicted. For a given sized database, we give both the maximum success rate of the algorithm and the required number of iterations when the algorithm is in the presence of phase errors. Through analysis and numerical simulations, it shows that optimized quantum random-walk search algorithm is more robust than Grover's algorithm.

abstract: We propose a method of optimally controlling the tradeoff of speed and fidelity of state transfer through a noisy quantum channel (spin-chain). This process is treated as qubit state-transfer through a fermionic bath. We show that dynamical modulation of the boundary-qubits levels can ensure state transfer with the best tradeoff of speed and fidelity. This is achievable by dynamically optimizing the transmission spectrum of the channel. The resulting optimal control is robust against both static and fluctuating noise in the channel's spin-spin couplings. It may also facilitate transfer in the presence of diagonal disorder (on site energy noise) in the channel.

abstract: We investigate the power of weak measurements in the framework of quantum state discrimination. First, we define and analyze the notion of weak consecutive measurements. Our main result is a convergence theorem whereby we demonstrate when and how a set of consecutive weak measurements converges to a strong measurement. Second, we show that for a small set of consecutive weak measurements, long before their convergence, one can separate close states without causing their collapse. We thus demonstrate a tradeoff between the success probability and the bias of the original vector towards collapse. Next we use post-selection within the Two-State-Vector Formalism and present the non-linear expansion of the expectation value of the measurement device's pointer to distinguish between two predetermined close vectors.

abstract: Optomechanical and electromechanical cavities have been widely used in quantum memories and quantum transducers. We theoretically investigate the robustness of opto(electro)-mechanical quan- tum memories against the noise of the control laser. By solving the Langevin equations and using the covariance matrix formalism in the presence of laser noise, the storing fidelity of Gaussian states is obtained. It is shown that, the destructive effect of phase noise is more significant in higher values of coupling laser amplitude and optomechanical coupling strength G. However, by further increasing coupling coefficient, the interaction time between photons and phonons decreases below the coherence time of laser frequency noise and the destructive effect of laser phase noise on the storing fidelity drops as well.

Procedure for transition to the Pauli approximation is conducted in the equations in the variables $(t, r)$, obtained after separating the angular dependence of $(\theta, \phi)$ from the wave function. The non-relativistic systems of equations in the variables $(t, r)$ is solved exactly in both models. The constructed wave functions do not represent stationary states with fixed energy, however the corresponding probability density does not depend on the time.

abstract: Two-qubit X-matrices have been the subject of considerable recent attention, as they lend themselves more readily to analytical investigations than two-qubit density matrices of arbitrary nature. Here, we maximally exploit this relative ease of analysis to formally derive an exhaustive collection of results pertaining to the separability probabilities of generalized two-qubit X-matrices endowed with Hilbert-Schmidt and, more broadly, induced measures. Further, the analytical results obtained exhibit interesting parallels to corresponding earlier (but, contrastingly, not yet fully rigorous) results for general 2-qubit states--deduced on the basis of determinantal moment formulas. Geometric interpretations can be given to arbitrary positive values of the random-matrix Dyson-index-like parameter $\alpha$ employed.

abstract: Non-Markovian evolution in open quantum systems is often characterized in terms of the backflow of information from environment to system and is thus an important facet in investigating the performance and robustness of quantum information protocols. In this work, we explore non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity of a metrological figure of merit, called the quantum interferometric power, which is based on the minimal quantum Fisher information obtained by local unitary evolution of one part of the system, and can be interpreted as a quantifier of quantum correlations beyond entanglement. We investigate our proposed non-Markovianity indicator in two relevant examples. First, we consider the action of a single-party dephasing channel on a maximally entangled two-qubit state, by applying the Jamio{\l}kowski-Choi isomorphism. We observe that the proposed measure is consistent with established non-Markovianity quantifiers defined using other approaches based on dynamical divisibility, distinguishability, and breakdown of monotonicity for the quantum mutual information. Further, we consider the dynamics of two-qubit Werner states, under the action of a local, single-party amplitude damping channel, and observe that the nonmonotonic evolution of the quantum interferometric power is more robust than the corresponding one for entanglement in capturing the backflow of quantum information associated with the non-Markovian process. Implications for the role of non-Markovianity in quantum metrology and possible extensions to continuous variable systems are discussed.

The simulated wave packet is discretized on a spatial grid and the grid points are mapped on the ion motional states which define the qubit network. The localization probability at each grid point is obtained from the population in the corresponding motional state. The quantum gate is the elementary evolution operator corresponding to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of the simulated system. The corresponding matrix can be estimated by any numerical algorithm. The radio-frequency field able to drive this unitary transformation among the qubit states of the ion is obtained by multi-target optimal control theory. The ion is assumed to be cooled in the ground motional state and the preliminary step consists in initializing the qubits with the amplitudes of the initial simulated wave packet. The time evolution of the localization probability at the grids points is then obtained by successive applications of the gate and reading out the motional state population. The gate field is always identical for a given simulated potential, only the field preparing the initial wave packet has to be optimized for different simulations. We check the stability of the simulation against decoherence due to fluctuating electric fields in the trap electrodes by applying dissipative Lindblad dynamics.

abstract: We show the utility of the weak value measurement to observe the quantum interference between two close lying atomic coherent states in a post-selected atomic cat state, produced in a system of $N$ identical two-level atoms weakly interacting with a single photon field. Through the observation of the negative parts of the Wigner distribution of the post-selected atomic cat state, we find that the post-selected atomic cat state becomes more nonclassical when the post-selected polarization state of the single photon field tends toward becoming orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We show that the small phase shift in the post-selected atomic cat state can be amplified via measuring the peak shift of its phase distribution when the post-selected state of the single photon field is nearly orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We find that the amplification factor of of 15 [5] can be obtained for a sample of 10 [100] atoms. This effectively provides us with a method to discriminate two close lying states on the Bloch sphere. We discuss possible experimental implementation of the scheme, and conclude with a discussion of the Fisher information.

abstract: Systems with local dynamics are characterized by a finite velocity of propagation of perturbations, known as the Lieb-Robinson velocity. On the other hand, irreducible stochastic processes drive states towards some unique fixed point. However, combining both effects is mathematically challenging. The bounds on propagation do not depend on system-size, while the theory of mixing is mostly based on extensive upper-bounds. In a previous paper, a class of local Lindbladian operators on arbitrary lattice was constructed, for which the two effects could be combined. In this paper, we show that for some local dynamics, local observables are propagated inside a much smaller convex subset of the total Banach space. This allows us to show localization for such dynamics.

abstract: Due to practical reasons, experimental and theoretical continuous-variable (CV) quantum information (QI) has been heavily based on Gaussian states. Nevertheless, many CV-QI protocols require the use of non-Gaussian states and operations. Here, we show that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering inequality can be used to obtain a practical witness for the generation of pure bipartite non-Gaussian states. While the scenario require pure states, we show its broad relevance by reporting the experimental observation of the non-Gaussianity of the CV two-photon state generated in the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The observed non-Gaussianity is due only to the intrinsic phase-matching conditions of SPDC

abstract: We investigate a two-way cascaded cavity QED system consisting of microtoroidal resonators coupled through an optical fiber. Each microtoroidal cavity supports two counter-propagating whispering-gallery modes coupled to single atoms through their evanescent fields. We focus on a pair of atom-microtoroid systems and compute the spectrum of spontaneous emission into the fiber with one atom initially excited. Explicit results are presented for strong-coupling and bad-cavity regimes, where the latter allows the effective atom-atom interaction to be controlled through the atom-cavity coupling and detuning: the atoms exhibit either collective spontaneous emission with no dipole-dipole interaction or a (coherent) dipole-dipole interaction and independent (single-atom) emission. This capacity for switching the character of the interaction is a feature of bi-directional coupling and connects our two-way cascaded system to work on one-dimensional waveguides. Building upon our bad-cavity results, we generalize to many atom-microtoroid systems coupled through an optical fiber.

abstract: This paper presents a physical mapping tool for quantum circuits, which generates the optimal Universal Logic Block (ULB) that can perform any logical fault-tolerant (FT) quantum operations with the minimum latency. The operation scheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum physical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the scheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution due to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation scheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions influence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between predecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies. The proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies by applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum data flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the quantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified force-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and quantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven instruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while making iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct scheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step that finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to the quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single best ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of different FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using information about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of the target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.

abstract: The coherence time constitutes one of the most critical parameters that determines whether or not interference is observed in an experiment. For photons, it is traditionally determined by the effective spectral bandwidth of the photon. Here we report on multi-photon interference experiments in which the multi-photon coherence time, defined by the width of the interference signal, depends on the number of interfering photons and on the measurement scheme chosen to detect the particles. A theoretical analysis reveals that all multi-photon interference with more than two particles features this dependence, which can be attributed to higher-order effects in the mutual indistinguishability of the particles. As a striking consequence, a single, well-defined many-particle quantum state can exhibit qualitatively different degrees of interference, depending on the chosen observable. Therefore, optimal sensitivity in many-particle quantum interferometry can only be achieved by choosing a suitable detection scheme.

abstract: We study the problem of witnessing entanglement among indistinguishable particles. For this purpose, we derive a set of equations which results in necessary and sufficient conditions for probing multipartite entanglement between arbitrary systems of Bosons or Fermions. The solution of these equations yields the construction of optimal entanglement witnesses for partial and full entanglement in discrete and continuous variable systems. Our approach unifies the verification of entanglement for distinguishable and indistinguishable particles. We provide general solutions for certain observables to study quantum entanglement in systems with different quantum statistics in noisy environments.

abstract: Quantum thermodynamics can be understood as a resource theory, whereby thermal states are free and the only allowed operations are unitary transformations commuting with the total Hamiltonian of the system. Previous literature on the subject has just focused on transformations between different state resources, overlooking the fact that quantum operations which do not commute with the total energy also constitute a potentially valuable resource. In this Letter, given a number of non-thermal quantum channels, we study the problem of how to integrate them in a thermal engine so as to distill a maximum amount of work. We find that, in the limit of asymptotically many uses of each channel, the distillable work is an additive function of the considered channels, computable for both finite dimensional quantum operations and bosonic channels. We apply our results to bound the amount of distillable work due to the natural non-thermal processes postulated in the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) collapse model. We find that, although GRW theory predicts the possibility to extract work from the vacuum at no cost, the power which a \emph{collapse engine} could in principle generate is extremely low.

abstract: We consider systems governed by the Gross Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with the Morse potential $V(x)=D(e^{-2ax}-2e^{-ax})$ as the trapping potential. For positive values of the coupling constant $g$ of the cubic term in GPE, we find that the critical value $g_c$ beyond which there are no bound states scales as $D^{3/4}$ (for large $D$). Studying the quantum evolution of wave packets, we observe that for $g<g_c$, the initial wave packet needs a critical momentum for the packet to escape from the potential. For $g>g_c$, on the otherhand, all initial wave packets escape from the potential and the dynamics is like that of a quantum free particle. For $g<0$, we find that there can be initial conditions for which the escaping wave packet can propagate with very little change in width i,e., it remains almost shape invariant.

abstract: We show that any unitary operator on the $d_A\times d_B$ system ($d_A\ge 2$) can be decomposed into the product of at most $4d_A-5$ controlled unitary operators. The number can be reduced to $2d_A-1$ when $d_A$ is a power of two. We also prove that three controlled unitaries can implement a bipartite complex permutation operator, and discuss the connection to an analogous result on classical reversible circuits. We further show that any $n$-partite unitary on the space $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes...\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d_n}$ is the product of at most $[2\prod^{n-1}_{j=1}(2d_j-2)-1]$ controlled unitary gates, each of which is controlled from $n-1$ systems. The number can be further reduced for $n=4$. We also decompose any bipartite unitary into the product of a simple type of bipartite gates and some local unitaries. We derive dimension-independent upper bounds for the CNOT-gate cost or entanglement cost of bipartite permutation unitaries (with the help of ancillas of fixed size) as functions of the Schmidt rank of the unitary. It is shown that such costs under a simple protocol are related to the log-rank conjecture in communication complexity theory via the link of nonnegative rank.

comments: 
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02710
abstract: Quantum mechanics relies on the cut between the observer and the quantum system, but it does not define the observer physically. We propose an informational definition based on bounded complexity of strings. Language dynamics then leads to an emergent continuous model in the critical regime. Restricting it to a subfamily of `quantum' binary codes describing `bipartite systems', we find strong evidence of an upper bound on bipartite correlations equal to 2.82537. This is measurably different from the Tsirelson bound of the CHSH inequality. If such a reconstruction of quantum theory is experimentally confirmed, it would show that the Hilbert space formalism is but an effective description of a fundamental `linguistic' theory in the critical regime.

abstract: Current understanding of correlations and quantum phase transitions in many-body systems has significantly improved thanks to the recent intensive studies of their entanglement properties. In contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum non-locality in these systems. On the one hand, standard, "theorist- and experimentalist-friendly" many-body observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. On the other hand, most of the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve correlations among many particles. Such correlations are notoriously hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally. Typically, there is no Bell inequality for many-body systems built only from low-order correlation functions. Recently, however, it has been shown in [J. Tura et al., Science 344, 1256 (2014)] that multipartite Bell inequalities constructed only from two-body correlation functions are strong enough to reveal non-locality in some many-body states, in particular those relevant for nuclear and atomic physics. The purpose of this lecture is to provide an overview of the problem of quantum correlations in many-body systems - from entanglement to nonlocality - and the methods for their characterization.

abstract: Laser control of molecular rotation is an area of active research. A number of recent studies has aimed at expanding the reach of rotational control to extreme, previously inaccessible rotational states, as well as controlling the directionality of molecular rotation. Dense ensembles of molecules undergoing ultrafast uni-directional rotation, known as molecular superrotors, are anticipated to exhibit unique properties, from spatially anisotropic diffusion and vortex formation to the creation of powerful acoustic waves and tuneable THz radiation. Here we describe our recent progress in controlling molecular rotation in the regime of high rotational excitation. We review two experimental techniques of producing uni-directional rotational wave packets with a "chiral train" of femtosecond pulses and an "optical centrifuge". Three complementary detection methods, enabling the direct observation, characterization and control of the superrotor states, are outlined: the one based on coherent Raman scattering, and two other methods employing both resonant and non-resonant multi-photon ionization. The capabilities of the described excitation and detection techniques are demonstrated with a few examples. The paper is concluded with an outlook for future developments.

In particular we will need the theory of self-adjoint extensions of differential operators in manifolds with boundary. An introduction of the latter as well as meaningful examples will be given. It is known that different boundary conditions can be used to describe different topologies of the associated quantum systems. We will use the previous results to study how this topology change can be accomplished in a dynamical way.

abstract: The Holevo bound is a keystone in many applications of quantum information theory. We propose "weak maximal Holevo quantity" with weak measurements as the generalization of the standard Holevo quantity which is defined as the optimal projective measurements. The scenarios that weak measurements is necessary are that only the weak measurements can be performed because for example the system is macroscopic or that one intentionally tries to do so such that the disturbance on the measured system can be controlled for example in quantum key distribution protocols. We evaluate systematically the weak maximal Holevo quantity for Bell-diagonal states and find a series of results. Furthermore, we find that weak measurements can be realized by noise and project measurements.

abstract: A time evolution operator in the interaction picture is given by exponentiating an interaction Hamiltonian $H$. Important examples of Hamiltonians, often encountered in quantum optics, condensed matter and high energy physics, are of a general form $H=r(A^\dagger-A)$, where $A$ is a multimode boson operator and $r$ is a coupling constant. If no simple factorization formula for the evolution operator exists, the calculation of the evolution operator is a notoriously difficult problem. In this case the only available option may be to Taylor expand the operator in $r$ and act on a state of interest $\psi$. But this brute-force method quickly hits the complexity barrier since the number of evaluated expressions increases exponentially. We relate a combinatorial structure called Dyck paths to the action of a boson word (monomial) on a quantum state $\psi$. This allows us to cross the exponential gap and make the problem of a boson unitary operator evaluation computationally tractable by achieving polynomial-time complexity for a large class of physically interesting multimode Hamiltonians.

abstract: We have previously shown that quantum-enhanced atom interferometry can be achieved by mapping the quantum state of squeezed optical vacuum to one of the atomic inputs via a beamsplitter-like process [Phys.~Rev.~A \textbf{90}, 063630 (2014)]. Here we ask the question: is a better phase sensitivity possible if the quantum state transfer (QST) is described by a three-mode-mixing model, rather than a beamsplitter? The answer is yes, but only if the portion of the optical state not transferred to the atoms is incorporated via information recycling. Surprisingly, our scheme gives a better sensitivity for lower QST efficiencies and with a sufficiently large degree of squeezing can attain near-Heisenberg-limited sensitivities for arbitrarily small QST efficiencies. Furthermore, we use the quantum Fisher information to demonstrate the near optimality of our scheme.

abstract: We report bulk, room-temperature hyperpolarization of 13C nuclear spins observed via high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The hyperpolarization is achieved by optical pumping (OP) of nitrogen vacancy defect centers in diamond accompanied by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). The technique harnesses the large optically-induced spin polarization of NV- centers at room temperature, which is many orders of magnitude greater than thermal equilibrium polarization and typically achievable only at sub-Kelvin temperatures. Transfer of the spin polarization to the 13C nuclear spins is accomplished via a combination of OP and microwave irradiation. The OP/DNP is performed at 420 mT, where inductive detection of NMR is feasible, in contrast to the typically exploited level anticrossing regimes at 100 mT and 50 mT. Here, we report a bulk nuclear spin polarization of 6%. This polarization was generated in situ and detected with a standard, inductive NMR probe without the need for sample shuttling or precise crystal orientation. Hyperpolarization via OP/DNP should operate at arbitrary magnetic fields, enabling orders of magnitude sensitivity enhancement for NMR of solids and liquids at ambient conditions.

abstract: We show for the one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model with $s=1/2$ that the energy gap between the ground and first excited states behaves anomalously as a function of the system size at the first-order quantum phase transition. Although it is generally the case that the energy gap closes exponentially at a quantum first-order transition, the gap in the present model behaves non-monotonically as a function of the system size, apparently very irregularly in some cases. This property of the gap is similar to that of the infinite-range quantum $XY$ model, in which the gap closes polynomially, exponentially, or even factorially fast depending on the choice of the series of system sizes toward the thermodynamic limit. This observation is surprising in consideration of the apparent maturity of our understanding of the one-dimensional quantum $XY$ model. Our result is also important from the viewpoint of quantum annealing, where the rate of gap closing determines the efficiency of computation.

abstract: In this paper, we study the separability of quantum states in bosonic system. Our main tool here is the "separability witnesses", and a connection between "separability witnesses" and a new kind of positivity of matrices--- "Power Positive Matrices" is drawn. Such connection is employed to demonstrate that multi-qubit quantum states with Dicke states being its eigenvectors is separable if and only if two related Hankel matrices are positive semidefinite. By employing this criterion, we are able to show that such state is separable if and only if it's partial transpose is non-negative, which confirms the conjecture in [Wolfe, Yelin, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2014)]. Then, we present a class of bosonic states in $d\otimes d$ system such that for general $d$, determine its separability is NP-hard although verifiable conditions for separability is easily derived in case $d=3,4$.

abstract: We describe a methodology and standard of proof for experimental claims of quantum random number generation (QRNG), analogous to well-established methods from precision measurement. For appropriately constructed physical implementations, lower bounds on the quantum contribution to the average min-entropy can be derived from measurements on the QRNG output. Given these bounds, randomness extractors allow generation of nearly perfect "{\epsilon}-random" bit streams. An analysis of experimental uncertainties then gives experimentally derived confidence levels on the {\epsilon} randomness of these sequences. We demonstrate the methodology by application to phase-diffusion QRNG, driven by spontaneous emission as a trusted randomness source. All other factors, including classical phase noise, amplitude fluctuations, digitization errors and correlations due to finite detection bandwidth, are treated with paranoid caution, i.e., assuming the worst possible behaviors consistent with observations. A data-constrained numerical optimization of the distribution of untrusted parameters is used to lower bound the average min-entropy. Under this paranoid analysis, the QRNG remains efficient, generating at least 2.3 quantum random bits per symbol with 8-bit digitization and at least 0.83 quantum random bits per symbol with binary digitization, at a confidence level of 0.99993. The result demonstrates ultrafast QRNG with strong experimental guarantees.

abstract: In this paper we study the influence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction on quantum correlations in two qubit Werner states and maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS). We consider our system as a closed system of a qubits pair and one auxiliary qubit which interact with any one of the qubit of the pair through DM interaction. We show that DM interaction, taken along any direction (x or y or z), does not affect two qubit Werner states. On the other hand the MEMS are affected by x and z components of DM interaction and remain unaffected by the y component. Further, we find that the state (i.e probability amplitude) of auxiliary qubit do not affect the quantum correlations in both the states, only DM interaction strength influences the quantum correlations. So one can avoid the intention to prepare the specific state of auxiliary qubit to manipulate the quantum correlations in both the states. We mention here that avoiding the preparation of state can contribute to cost reduction in quantum information processing. We also observe the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death in the present study.

abstract: The celebrated Hong, Ou and Mandel (HOM) effect is one of the simplest illustrations of two-particle interference, and is unique to the quantum realm. In the original experiment, two photons arriving simultaneously in the input channels of a beam-splitter were observed to always emerge together in one of the output channels. Here, we report on the realisation of a closely analogous experiment with atoms instead of photons. This opens the prospect of testing Bell's inequalities involving mechanical observables of massive particles, such as momentum, using methods inspired by quantum optics, with an eye on theories of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our work also demonstrates a new way to produce and benchmark twin-atom pairs that may be of interest for quantum information processing and quantum simulation.

abstract: The precise knowledge of the temperature of an ultracold lattice gas simulating a strongly correlated system is a question of both, fundamental and technological importance. Here, we address such question by combining tools from quantum metrology together with the study of the quantum correlations embedded in the system at finite temperatures. Within this frame we examine the spin-$1/2$ XY chain, first estimating, by means of the quantum Fisher information, the lowest attainable bound on the temperature precision. We then address the estimation of the temperature of the sample from the analysis of correlations using a quantum non demolishing Faraday spectroscopy method. Finally, we demonstrate that for sufficiently low temperatures the proposed measurements are optimal to estimate accurately the temperature of the sample.

Our basic building blocks are 3D Transmon qubits where we use the naturally occurring dipolar interactions to realize interacting spin systems. This opens the way toward the realization of a broad class of tunable spin models in both two- and one-dimensional geometries. We illustrate the potential offered by these systems in the context of dimerized Majumdar-Ghosh-type phases, archetypical examples of quantum magnetism, showing how such phases are robust against disorder and decoherence, and could be observed within state-of-the-art experiments.

abstract: We investigate the notion of quantumness based on the non-commutativity of the algebra of observables and introduce a measure of quantumness based on the mutual incompatibility of quantum states. Since it relies on the full algebra of observables, our measure for composed systems is partition independent and witnesses the global quantum nature of a state. We show that such quantity can be experimentally measured with an interferometric setup and that, when an arbitrary bipartition is introduced, it detects the one-way quantum correlations restricted to one of the two subsystems. We finally show that, by combining only two projective measurements and carrying out the interference procedure, our measure becomes an efficient universal witness of quantum discord and non-classical correlations.

abstract: Bell [Helv. Phys.Act. 48 1975] described an idealized test of the projection postulate in order to illustrate the ambiguities in the experimental predictions of quantum theory. An approach to the implementation of such tests is outlined here, based on the interesting logical relationship between the projection postulate and the no-superluminal-signaling principle. Gisin's theorem [Helv. Phys. Act. 62 1989] shows that the no-signaling principle implies that any description of projection at the elementary level must be nondeterministic. The lack of determinism means that information cannot be instantiated in a reproducible and transmittable form in isolated microsystems. The implied limitation on information allows one to interpret the no-signaling principle in purely physical terms as a prohibition of superluminal information transmission. This prohibition, in turn, imposes tight constraints on the connection between projection and elementary processes, leading to a specific hypothesis about how projection effects originate. The hypothesis serves as the basis for the experimental proposal.

abstract: At a fundamental level, the classical picture of the world is dead, and has been dead now for almost a century. Pinning down exactly which quantum phenomena are responsible for this has proved to be a tricky and controversial question, but a lot of progress has been made in the past few decades. We now have a range of precise statements showing that whatever the ultimate laws of Nature are, they cannot be classical. In this article, we review results on the fundamental phenomena of quantum theory that cannot be understood in classical terms. We proceed by first granting quite a broad notion of classicality, describe a range of quantum phenomena (such as randomness, discreteness, the indistinguishability of states, measurement-uncertainty, measurement-disturbance, complementarity, noncommutativity, interference, the no-cloning theorem, and the collapse of the wave-packet) that do fall under its liberal scope, and then finally describe some aspects of quantum physics that can never admit a classical understanding -- the intrinsically quantum mechanical aspects of Nature. The most famous of these is Bell's theorem, but we also review two more recent results in this area. Firstly, Hardy's theorem shows that even a finite dimensional quantum system must contain an infinite amount of information, and secondly, the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph theorem shows that the wave-function must be an objective property of an individual quantum system. Besides being of foundational interest, results of this sort now find surprising practical applications in areas such as quantum information science and the simulation of quantum systems.

abstract: All classical and quantum technologies that encode in and retrieve information from optical fields rely on the ability to selectively manipulate orthogonal field modes of light. Such manipulation can be achieved with high selectivity for polarization modes and transverse-spatial modes. For the time-frequency degree of freedom, this could efficiently be achieved for a limited choice of approximately orthogonal modes, i.e. non-overlapping bins in time or frequency. We recently proposed a method that surmounts the selectivity barrier for sorting arbitrary orthogonal temporal modes [Opt. Lett. {\bf 39}, 2924 (2014)] using cascaded interferometric quantum frequency conversion in nonlinear optical media. We call this method temporal-mode interferometry, as it has a close resemblance to the well-known separated-fields atomic interferometry method introduced by Ramsey. The method has important implications for quantum memories, quantum dense coding, quantum teleportation, and quantum key distribution. Here we explore the inner workings of the method in detail, and extend it to multiple stages with a concurrent asymptotic convergence of temporal-mode selectivity to unity. We also complete our analysis of pump-chirp compensation to counter pump-induced nonlinear phase-modulation in four-wave mixing implementations.

abstract: Light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) has drawn a great deal of attention for its important applications in the fields of precise optical measurements and high capacity optical communications. Here we adopt a method to study the rotation of a light beam, which is based on magnetic field induced circular birefringence in warm 87Rb atomic vapor. The dependence of the rotation angle to the intensity of the magnetic field makes it appropriate for weak magnetic field measurement. We derive a detail theoretical description that is in well agreement with the experimental observations. The experiment shows here provides a new method for precise measurement of magnetic field intensity and expands the application of OAM-carrying light.

abstract: We develop a theory for long-distance quantum key distribution based on concatenated entanglement swapping using parametric down-conversion sources and show numerical results of our model. The model incorporates practical resources including multi-pair sources, inefficient detectors with dark counts and lossy channels. We calculate the maximum secret key-generation ratefor up to three entanglement swapping stations by optimizing over resource parameters, and our numerical simulation shows that the range of quantum key distribution can in principle be markedly increased but at the expense of an atrociously unfeasible secret key-generation rate; however, the upper bound of our key rates closely approach the Takeoka-Guha-Wilde upper bound. Our analysis demonstrates the need for new technology such as quantum memory to synchronize photons and our methods should serve as a valuable component for accurately modelling quantum-memory-based long-distance quantum key distribution.

abstract: We study, in the paradigm of open quantum systems, the entanglement dynamics of two uniformly accelerated atoms with the same acceleration perpendicular to the separation. The two-atom system is treated as an open system coupled with a bath of fluctuating massless scalar fields in the Minkowski vacuum, and the master equation that governs its evolution is derived. It has been found that, for accelerated atoms with a nonvanishing separation, entanglement sudden death is a general feature when the initial state is entangled, while for those in a separable initial state, entanglement sudden birth only happens for atoms with an appropriate interatomic separation and sufficiently small acceleration. Remarkably, accelerated atoms can get entangled in certain circumstances while the inertial ones in the Minkowski vacuum can not. A comparison between the results of accelerated atoms and those of static ones in a thermal bath shows that, uniformly accelerated atoms exhibit distinct features from those immersed in a thermal bath at the Unruh temperature in terms of entanglement dynamics.

abstract: Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a form of inseparability in quantum theory commonly acknowledged to be intermediate between entanglement and Bell nonlocality. However, this statement has so far only been proven for a restricted class of measurements, namely projective measurements. Here we prove that entanglement, one-way steering, two-way steering and nonlocality are genuinely different considering general measurements, i.e. single round positive-operator-valued-measures. Finally, we show that the use of sequences of measurements is relevant for steering tests, as they can be used to reveal "hidden steering".

abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) gaurantees unconditional communication security based on the laws of quantum physics. However, practical QKD suffers from a number of quantum hackings due to the device imperfections. From the security standpoint, measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) is in the limelight since it eliminates all the possible loop- holes in detection. Due to active control units for mode matching between the photons from remote parties, however, the implementation of MDI-QKD is highly impractical. In this article, we pro- pose a novel method in which the indistinguishability issue is resolved without any active control unit. By introducing Plug-and-Play (P&P) concept into MDI-QKD, the indistinguishability be- tween photons can naturally be guaranteed. We show the feasibility of P&P MDI-QKD with a proof-of-principle experiment.

abstract: By using a continuum of oscillators as a reservoir, we present a classical and a quantum-mechanical treatment for the Higgs model in the presence of dissipation. In this base, a fully canonical approach is used to quantize the damped particle on a spherical surface under the action of a conservative central force, the conjugate momentum is defined and the Hamiltonian is derived. The equations of motion for the canonical variables and in turn the Langevin equation are obtained. It is shown that the dynamics of the dissipative Higgs model is not only determined by a projected susceptibility tensor that obeys the Kramers-Kronig relations and a noise operator but also the curvature of the spherical space. Due to the gnomonic projection from the spherical space to the tangent plane, the projected susceptibility displays anisotropic character in the tangent plane. To illuminate the effect of dissipation on the Higgs model, the transition rate between energy levels of the particle on the sphere is calculated. It is seen that appreciable probabilities for transition are possible only if the transition and reservoir's oscillators frequencies to be nearly on resonance.

In particular, the curvature of the curve has the role of the nonadiabatic coupling.

abstract: The leading asymptotic large-scale behavior of the spatially bipartite entanglement entropy (EE) of the free Fermi gas infinitely extended in multidimensionsal Euclidean space at zero absolute temperature, T=0, is by now well understood. Here, we announce and discuss the first rigorous results for the corresponding EE of thermal equilibrium states at T>0. The leading large-scale term of this thermal EE turns out to be twice the leading finite-size correction to the infinite-volume thermal entropy (density). Not surprisingly, this correction is just the thermal entropy on the boundary surface of the bipartition. However, it is given by a rather complicated analytical expression derived from semiclassical functional calculus and differs, at least at high temperature, from simpler expressions previously obtained by arguments based on conformal field theory. In the zero-temperature limit, the leading large-scale term of the thermal EE considerably simplifies and displays a ln(1/T)-singularity which one may identify with the known logarithmic correction at T=0 to the so-called area-law scaling. Our results extend to the whole one-parameter family of (quantum) R\'enyi entropies.

abstract: We geometrically characterize one-qubit dissipators of a Lindblad type. An efficient parametrization in terms of 6 linear parameters opens the way to various optimizations with local dissipation. As an example, we study maximal steady-state singlet fraction that can be achieved with an arbitrary local dissipation and two qubit Hamiltonian. We show that this singlet fraction has a discontinuity as one moves from unital to non-unital dissipators and demonstrate that the largest possible singlet fraction is approximately 0.654. This means that for systems with a sufficiently entangled ground state there is a fundamental quantum limit to the lowest attainable energy. With local dissipation one is unable to cool the system below some limiting non-zero temperature.

abstract: Spin ensemble based hybrid quantum systems suffer from a significant degree of decoherence resulting from the inhomogeneous broadening of the spin transition frequencies in the ensemble. We demonstrate that this strongly restrictive drawback can be overcome simply by burning two narrow spectral holes in the spin spectral density at judiciously chosen frequencies. Using this procedure we find an increase of the coherence time by more than an order of magnitude as compared to the case without hole burning. Our findings pave the way for the practical use of these hybrid quantum systems for the processing of quantum information.

abstract: The results of space-like separated measurements are independent of distant measurement settings, a property one might call two-way no-signalling. In contrast, time-like separated measurements are only one-way no-signalling since the past is independent of the future but not vice-versa. For this reason temporal correlations that are formally identical to non-classical spatial correlations can still be modelled classically. We define non-classical temporal correlations as the ones which cannot be simulated by propagating in time a classical information content of a quantum system. We first show that temporal correlations between results of any projective quantum measurements on a qubit can be simulated classically. Then we present a sequence of measurements on a single $m$-level quantum system that cannot be explained by propagating in time $m$-level classical system and using classical computers with unlimited memory.

abstract: Between 1964 and 1990, the notion of nonlocality in Bell's papers underwent a profound change as his nonlocality theorem gradually became detached from quantum mechanics, and referred to wider probabilistic theories involving correlations between separated beables. The proposition that standard quantum mechanics is itself nonlocal (more precisely, that it violates `local causality') became divorced from the Bell theorem per se from 1976 on, although this important point is widely overlooked in the literature. In 1990, the year of his death, Bell would express serious misgivings about the mathematical form of the local causality condition, and leave ill-defined the issue of the consistency between special relativity and violation of the Bell-type inequality. In our view, the significance of the Bell theorem, both in its deterministic and stochastic forms, can only be fully understood by taking into account the fact that a fully Lorentz-covariant version of quantum theory, free of action-at-a-distance, can be articulated in the Everett interpretation.

abstract: Using tapered fibers of As2Se3 chalcogenide glass, we produce photon pairs at telecommunication wavelengths with low pump powers. We found maximum coincidences-to-accidentals ratios of $2.13\pm0.07$ for degenerate pumping with 3.2 {\mu}W average power, and $1.33\pm0.03$ for non-degenerate pumping with 1.0 {\mu}W and 1.5 {\mu}W average power of the two pumps. Our results show that the ultrahigh nonlinearity in these microwires could allow single-photon pumping to produce photon pairs, enabling the production of large entangled states, heralding of single photons after lossy transmission, and photonic quantum information processing with nonlinear optics.

This is a first step towards demonstrating entanglement between distant quantum memories (realized with quantum dots), which in turn is a milestone in the roadmap for building a functional quantum repeater. We also place this experimental work in context by providing an overview of quantum repeaters, their potential uses, and the challenges in implementing them.

abstract: Possibly, teleportation is the most representative quantum algorithm in the public domain. Nevertheless than this quantum procedure transmits only information than objects, its coverage is still very limited and easily subject to errors. Based on a fine control of quantum resources, particularly those entangled, the research to extend its coverage and flexibility is open, in particular on matter based quantum systems. This work shows how anisotropic Ising interactions could be used as natural basis for this procedure, based on a sequence of magnetic pulses driving Ising interaction, stating results in specialized quantum gates designed for magnetic systems.

abstract: In the Hermitian regime, a Berry phase is always the real number. It may be imaginary for a non-Hermitian system, which leads to amplitude amplification or attenuation of an evolved quantum state. We study the dynamics of the non-Hermitian Rice-Mele model driven by a time-dependent external field. The exact results show that it can have full real spectrum for any value of the field. Several rigorous results are presented for the Berry phase with respect to the varying field. We show that the Berry phase is the same complex constant for any initial state in a single sub-band. Numerical simulation indicates that the amplitude control of a state can be accomplished by a quasi-adiabatic process within a short time.

abstract: The effect of phase space general noncommutativity on producing deformed coherent squeezed states is examined. A two-dimensional noncommutative quantum system supported by a deformed mathematical structure similar to that of Hadamard billiards is obtained and their components behavior are monitored in time. It is assumed that the independent degrees of freedom are two \emph{free} 1D harmonic oscillators (HO's), so the system Hamiltonian does not contain interaction terms. Through the noncommutative deformation parameterized by a Seiberg-Witten transform on the original canonical variables, one gets the standard commutation relations for the new ones, such that the obtained Hamiltonian represents then two \emph{interacting} 1D HO's. By assuming that one HO is inverted relatively to the other, we show that their effective interaction induces a squeezing dynamics for initial coherent states imaged in the phase space. A suitable pattern of logarithmic spirals is obtained and some relevant properties are discussed in terms of Wigner functions, which are essential to put in evidence the effects of the noncommutativity.

abstract: The foundational ideas of quantum mechanics continue to give rise to counterintuitive theories and physical effects that are in conflict with a classical description of Nature. Experiments with light at the single photon level have historically been at the forefront of tests of fundamental quantum theory and new developments in photonics engineering continue to enable new experiments. Here we review recent photonic experiments to test two foundational themes in quantum mechanics: wave-particle duality, central to recent complementarity and delayed-choice experiments; and Bell nonlocality where recent theoretical and technological advances have allowed all controversial loopholes to be separately addressed in different photonics experiments.

abstract: A Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential features stationary solutions even for attractive contact interaction as long as the particle number and therefore the interaction strength do not exceed a certain limit. Introducing balanced gain and loss into such a system drastically changes the bifurcation scenario at which these states are created. Instead of two tangent bifurcations at which the symmetric and antisymmetric states emerge, one tangent bifurcation between two formerly independent branches arises [D. Haag et al., Phys. Rev. A 89, 023601 (2014)]. We study this transition in detail using a bicomplex formulation of the time-dependent variational principle and find that in fact there are three tangent bifurcations for very small gain-loss contributions which coalesce in a cusp bifurcation.

abstract: Polar codes are the first capacity achieving and efficiently implementable codes for classical communication. Recently they have also been generalized to communication over classical-quantum and quantum channels. In this work we present our recent results for polar coding in quantum information theory, including applications to classical-quantum multiple access channels, interference channels and compound communication settings, including the first proof of channel coding achieving the Han-Kobayashi rate region of the interference channel without the need of a simultaneous decoder. Moreover we add to the existing framework by extending polar codes to achieve the asymmetric capacity and improving the block error probability for classical-quantum channels. In addition we use polar codes to prove a new achievable rate region for the classical-quantum broadcast channel. We also discuss polar codes for quantum communication over quantum channels and state results towards codes for compound quantum channels in this setting. We conclude by stating a list of interesting open questions to invite further research on the topic.

abstract: We address quantitatively the relationship between the nonlinearity of a mechanical resonator and the nonclassicality of its ground state. In particular, we analyze the nonclassical properties of the nonlinear Duffing oscillator (being driven or not) as a paradigmatic example of a nonlinear nanomechanical resonator. We first discuss how to quantify the nonlinearity of this system and then show that the nonclassicality of the ground state, as measured by the volume occupied by the negative part of the Wigner function, monotonically increases with the nonlinearity in all the working regimes addressed in our study. Our results show quantitatively that nonlinearity is a resource to create nonclassical states in mechanical systems.

abstract: We study several classical like properties of q-deformed nonlinear coherent states as well as nonclassical behaviours of q-deformed version of the Schrodinger cat states in noncommutative space. Coherent states in q-deformed space are found to be minimum uncertainty states together with the squeezed photon distributions unlike the ordinary systems, where the photon distributions are always Poissonian. Several advantages of utilising cat states in noncommutative space over the standard quantum mechanical spaces have been reported here. For instance, the q-deformed parameter has been utilised to improve the squeezing of the quadrature beyond the ordinary case. Most importantly, the parameter provides an extra degree of freedom by which we achieve both quadrature squeezed and number squeezed cat states at the same time in a single system, which is impossible to achieve from ordinary cat states.

abstract: Controlling quantum entanglement between parts of a many-body system is the key to unlocking the power of quantum information processing for applications such as quantum computation, highprecision sensing, and simulation of many-body physics. Spin degrees of freedom of ultracold neutral atoms in their ground electronic state provide a natural platform given their long coherence times and our ability to control them with magneto-optical fields, but creating strong coherent coupling between spins has been challenging. We demonstrate a Rydberg-dressed ground-state blockade that provides a strong tunable interaction energy (~1 MHz in units of Planck's constant) between spins of individually trapped cesium atoms. With this interaction we directly produce Bell-state entanglement between two atoms with a fidelity >= 81(2)%, excluding atom loss events, and >= 60(3)% when loss is included.

abstract: By properly driving a qubit-resonator system in the strong dispersive regime, we implement an "impedance-matched" $\Lambda$ system in the dressed states, where a resonant single photon deterministically induces a Raman transition and excites the qubit. Combining this effect and a fast dispersive readout of the qubit, we realize a detector of itinerant microwave photons. We theoretically analyze the single-photon response of the $\Lambda$ system and evaluate its performance as a detector. We achieve a high detection efficiency close to unity without relying on precise temporal control of the input pulse shape and under a conservative estimate of the system parameters. The detector can also be reset quickly by applying microwave pulses, which allows a short dead time and a high repetition rate.

abstract: We construct a density matrix whose elements are written in terms of expectation values of non-Hermitian operators and their products for arbitrary dimensional bipartite states. We then show that any expression which involves matrix elements can be reformulated by the expectation values of these non-Hermitian operators and vice versa. We consider the condition of pure states and pure product states and rewrite them in terms of expectation values and density matrix elements respectively. We utilize expectation values of these operators to present the condition for separability of ${C}^d \otimes {C}^d$ bipartite states. With the help of our separability criterion we detect entanglement in certain classes of higher dimensional bipartite states.

abstract: Quantum interfaces between photons and ensembles of atoms have emerged as powerful tools for quantum technologies. High fidelity storage and retrieval of a photon in a collective quantum state of many atoms requires long-lived collective superposition states typically achieved with immobilized atoms. Thermal atomic vapors, which present a simple and scalable resource, have been so far only used for continuous variable processing or for discrete variable processing on short time scales where atomic motion is negligible. We develop a theory based on the concept of motional averaging to enable room temperature discrete variable quantum memories and coherent single photon sources. We show that by choosing the interaction so that atoms can cross the light beam several times during the interaction and by suitable spectral filtering, we erase the "which atom" information and obtain an efficient and homogenous coupling between all atoms and the light. Heralded single excitations can thus be created and stored as collective spinwaves, which can later be read out to produce coherent single photons in a scalable fashion. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to scalable quantum memories with a proof of principle experiment with room temperature atoms contained in microcells with spin protecting coating, placed inside an optical cavity.

abstract: We demonstrate a solid-state spin-wave optical quantum memory with on-demand read-out in a Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal. Using the full atomic frequency comb scheme, we store weak coherent pulses at the single-photon level with a signal to noise ratio $> 10$. Narrow-band spectral filtering based on spectral hole burning in a second Pr$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal is used to filter out the excess noise created by control pulses to reach an unconditional noise level of $(2.0 \pm 0.3) \times10^{-3}$ photons per pulse. We also report spin-wave storage of photonic time-bin qubits with conditional fidelities higher than a classical measure and prepare strategy, demonstrating that the spin-wave memory operates in the quantum regime. These results represent an important step for the use of solid-state quantum memories in scalable quantum networks.

abstract: Long-lived quantum memories are essential components of a long-standing goal of remote distribution of entanglement in quantum networks. These can be realized by storing the quantum states of light as single-spin excitations in atomic ensembles. However, spin states are often subjected to different dephasing processes that limit the storage time, which in principle could be overcome using spin-echo techniques. Theoretical studies have suggested this to be challenging due to unavoidable spontaneous emission noise in ensemble-based quantum memories. Here we demonstrate spin-echo manipulation of a mean spin excitation of 1 in a large solid-state ensemble, generated through storage of a weak optical pulse. After a storage time of about 1 ms we optically read out the spin excitation with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Our results pave the way for long-duration optical quantum storage using spin-echo techniques for any ensemble-based memory. Our experiment also achieves an order-of-magnitude longer storage time over previous reversible (in-out) optical memories operating at the single photon level.

abstract: A complete and consistent inversion technique is proposed to derive an accurate interaction potential from an effective-range function for a given partial wave in the neutral case. First, the effective-range function is Taylor or Pad\'e expanded, which allows high precision fitting of the experimental scattering phase shifts with a minimal number of parameters on a large energy range. Second, the corresponding poles of the scattering matrix are extracted in the complex wave-number plane. Third, the interaction potential is constructed with supersymmetric transformations of the radial Schr\"odinger equation. As an illustration, the method is applied to the experimental phase shifts of the neutron-proton elastic scattering in the $^1S_0$ and $^1D_2$ channels on the $[0-350]$ MeV laboratory energy interval.

abstract: Interaction is so ubiquitous that imaging a world free from it is a difficult fantasy exercise. At the same time, in understanding any complex physical system, our ability of accounting for the mutual interaction of its constituents is often insufficient when not the restraining factor. Many strategies have been devised to control particle-particle interaction and explore the diverse regimes, from weak to strong interaction. Beautiful examples of these achievements are the experiments on Bose condensates, or the recent experiments on the dynamics of spin chains. Here I introduce another possibility, namely replacing the particle-particle interaction with an external stochastic field, and once again reducing the dynamics of a many-body system to the dynamics of single-particle systems. The theory is exact, in the sense that no approximations are introduced in decoupling the many-body system in its non-interacting sub-parts. Moreover, the equations of motion are linear, and no unknown external potential is inserted.

abstract: To advance our understanding of Quantum Cellular Automata in problem solving through parallel and distributed computing, this research quantized the density classification problem and adopted the Quantum Particle Automata (QPA) to solve the quantized problem. In order to solve this problem, the QPA needed a unitary operator to carry out the QPA evolution and a boundary partition to make the classification decisions. We designed a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for the unitary operators and the boundary partitions to classify the density of binary inputs with length 5. The GA was able to find more than one unitary operator that can transform the QPA in ways such that when the particle was measured, it was more likely to collapse to the basis states that were on the correct side of the boundary partition for the QPA to decide if the binary input had majority density 0 or majority density 1. We analyzed these solutions and found that the QPA evolution dynamic was driven by a particular parameter $\theta$ of the unitary operator: a small $\theta$ gave the particle small mass hence fast evolution while large $\theta$ had the opposite effect. While these results are encouraging, scaling these solutions for binary inputs of arbitrary length of $n$ requires additional analysis, which we will investigate in our future work.

abstract: The transitivity of preferences is one of the basic assumptions used in the theory of games and decisions. It is often equated with rationality of choice and is considered useful in building rankings. Intransitive preferences are considered paradoxical and undesirable. This problem is discussed by many social and natural sciences. The paper discusses a simple model of sequential game in which two players in each iteration of the game choose one of the two elements. They make their decisions in different contexts defined by the rules of the game. It appears that the optimal strategy of one of the players can only be intransitive! (the so-called \textsl{relevant intransitive strategies}.) On the other hand, the optimal strategy for the second player can be either transitive or intransitive. A quantum model of the game using pure one-qubit strategies is considered. In this model, an increase in importance of intransitive strategies is observed -- there is a certain course of the game where intransitive strategies are the only optimal strategies for both players. The study of decision-making models using quantum information theory tools may shed some new light on the understanding of mechanisms that drive the formation of types of preferences.

Using optically trapped Rb atoms the $T_2$ coherence time is 2.6(3) ms for $\bar N=7.6$ atoms and scales approximately inversely with the number of atoms. Strong Rydberg blockade between two ensemble qubits is demonstrated with a fidelity of $0.89(1)$ and a fidelity of $\sim \hspace{-.05cm}1.0$ when postselected on control ensemble excitation. These results are a significant step towards deterministic entanglement of atomic ensembles.

We review and critique some recent proposals for improving the memory time by introducing long-range interactions among anyons, noting that instability with respect to small local perturbations of the Hamiltonian is a generic problem for such proposals. We also discuss some broader issues regarding the prospects for scalable quantum memory in two-dimensional systems.

abstract: Recently, it has been argued that quantum mechanics is a complete theory, and that different quantum states do necessarily correspond to different elements of reality, under the assumptions that quantum mechanics is correct and that measurement settings can be freely chosen. In this work, we prove that this result is a consequence of an unnecessarily strong mathematical expression of the free choice assumption, which embodies more conditions than explicitly stated. The issues of the completeness of quantum mechanics, and of the interpretation of the state vector, are by no means resolved. Taking this perspective, we describe how the recently introduced class of crypto-nonlocal hidden variables theories can be used to characterize the maximal possible departure from quantum mechanics, when the system consists of a pair of qubits.

abstract: We investigate topological properties of density matrices motivated by the question to what extent phenomena like topological insulators and superconductors can be generalized to mixed states in the framework of open quantum systems. The notion of geometric phases has been extended from pure to mixed states by Uhlmann in [Rep. Math. Phys. 24, 229 (1986)], where an emergent gauge theory over the density matrices based on their pure-state representation in a larger Hilbert space has been reported. However, since the uniquely defined square root $\sqrt{\rho}$ of a density matrix $\rho$ provides a global gauge, this construction is always topologically trivial. Here, we study a more restrictive gauge structure which can be topologically non-trivial and is capable of resolving homotopically distinct mappings of density matrices subject to various spectral constraints. Remarkably, in this framework, topological invariants can be directly defined and calculated for mixed states. In the limit of pure states, the well known system of topological invariants for gapped band structures at zero temperature is reproduced. We compare our construction with recent approaches to Chern insulators at finite temperature.

In this paper, I make a few points in order to help clarify the situation.

abstract: Recently, several aspects of controlled quantum communication (e.g., bidirectional controlled state teleportation, controlled quantum secure direct communication, controlled quantum dialogue, etc.) have been studied using $n$-qubit ($n\geq3$) entanglement. Specially, a large number of schemes for bidirectional controlled state teleportation are proposed using $m$-qubit entanglement ($m\in\{5,6,7\}$). Here, we propose a set of protocols to illustrate that it is possible to realize all these tasks related to controlled quantum communication using only Bell states and permutation of particles (PoP). As the generation and maintenance of a Bell state is much easier than a multi-partite entanglement, the proposed strategy has a clear advantage over the existing proposals. Further, it is shown that all the schemes proposed here may be viewed as applications of the concept of quantum cryptographic switch which was recently introduced by some of us. The performances of the proposed protocols as subjected to the amplitude damping and phase damping noise on the channels are also discussed.

abstract: An example of full solution of the inverse scattering problem on the half line is presented. For this purpose, a simple analytically solvable model system (Morse potential) is used, which is expected to be a reasonable approximation to a real potential. First one calculates all spectral characteristics for the fixed model system. This way one gets all the necessary input data (otherwise unobtainable) to implement powerful methods of the inverse scattering theory. In this paper, the multi-step procedure to solve the Marchenko integral equation is described in full details. Excellent performance of the method is demonstrated and its combination with the Marchenko differential equation is discussed. In addition to the main results, several important analytic properties of the Morse potential are unveiled. For example, a simple analytic algorithm to calculate the phase shift is derived.

abstract: A rational secret sharing scheme is a game in which each party responsible for reconstructing a secret tries to maximize his utility by obtaining the secret alone. Quantum secret sharing schemes, either derived from quantum teleportation or from quantum error correcting code, do not succeed when we assume rational participants. This is because all existing quantum secret sharing schemes consider that the secret is reconstructed by a party chosen by the dealer. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a quantum secret sharing scheme which is resistant to rational parties. The proposed scheme is fair (everyone gets the secret), correct and achieves strict Nash equilibrium.

abstract: The synthesis of ultra-long lived acoustic phonons in a variety of materials and device geometries could enable a range of new coherent information processing and sensing technologies; many forms of phonon dissipation pose a barrier to this goal. We explore linear and nonlinear contributions to phonon dissipation in silica at cryogenic temperatures using fiber-optic structures that tightly confine both photons and phonons to the fiber-optic core. When immersed in helium, this fiber system supports nearly perfect guidance of 9 GHz acoustic phonons; strong electrostrictively mediated photon-phonon coupling (or guided-wave stimulated Brillouin scattering) permits a flexible form of laser-based phonon spectroscopy. Through linear and nonlinear phonon spectroscopy, we isolate the effects of disorder-induced two-level tunneling states as a source of phononic dissipation in this system. We show that an ensemble of such two-level tunneling states can be driven into transparency--virtually eliminating this source of phonon dissipation over a broad range of frequencies. Experimental studies of phononic self-frequency saturation show excellent agreement with a theoretical model accounting for the phonon coupling to an ensemble of two-level tunneling states. Extending these results, we demonstrate a general approach to suppress dissipation produced by two-level tunneling states via cross-saturation, where the lifetime of a phonons at one frequency can be extended by the presence of a high intensity acoustic beam at another frequency. Although these studies were carried out in silica, our findings are quite general, and can be applied to a range of materials systems and device geometries.

abstract: Symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) is a key quantity to obtain quantum Fisher information (QFI) and to construct the corresponding optimal measurements. Here we develop a method to calculate the SLD and QFI via anti-commutators. This method is originated from the Lyapunov representation and would be very useful for cases that the anti-commutators among the state and its partial derivative exhibits periodic properties. As an application, we discuss a class of states, whose squares linearly depend on the states themselves, and give the corresponding analytical expressions of SLD and QFI. A noisy scenario of this class of states is also considered and discussed. Finally, we readily apply the method to the block-diagonal states and the multi-parameter estimation problems.

abstract: The Pauli groups are ubiquitous in quantum information theory because of their usefulness in describing quantum states and operations and their readily understood symmetry properties. In addition, the most well-understood quantum error correcting codes -- stabilizer codes -- are built using Pauli operators. The eigenstates of these operators -- stabilizer states -- display a structure (e.g., mutual orthogonality relationships) that has made them useful in examples of multi-qubit non-locality and contextuality. Here, we apply the graph-theoretical contextuality formalism of Cabello, Severini and Winter to sets of stabilizer states, with particular attention to the effect of generalizing two-level qubit systems to odd prime d-level qudit systems. While state-independent contextuality using two-qubit states does not generalize to qudits, we show explicitly how state-dependent contextuality associated with a Bell inequality does generalize. Along the way we note various structural properties of stabilizer states, with respect to their orthogonality relationships, which may be of independent interest.

abstract: Efficient fourth order symplectic integrators are proposed for numerical integration of separable Hamiltonian systems H(p,q)=T(p)+V(q). Symmetric splitting coefficients with five to nine stages are obtained by higher order decomposition of the simple harmonic oscillator. The performance of the methods is evaluated for various Hamiltonian systems: Integration errors are compared to those of acclaimed integrators composed by S. Blanes et al. (2013), W. Kahan et al. (1999) and H. Yoshida (1990). Numerical tests indicate that the integrators obtained in this paper perform significantly better than previous integrators for common Hamiltonian systems.

abstract: We present a scheme for implementing high-fidelity quantum logic gates using the quantum walk of a few interacting bosons on a one-dimensional lattice. The gate operation is carried out by a single compact lattice described by a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbor hopping and on-site interactions. We find high-fidelity deterministic logic operations for a gate set (including the CNOT gate) that is universal for quantum information processing. We discuss the applicability of this scheme in light of recent developments in controlling and monitoring cold-atoms in optical lattices, as well as an implementation with realistic nonlinear quantum photonic devices.

abstract: We study classical source coding with quantum side-information where the quantum side-information is observed by a helper and sent to the decoder via a classical channel. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate region for this problem. The direct part of our result is proved via the measurement compression theory by Winter. Our result reveals that a helper's scheme that separately conducts a measurement and a compression is suboptimal, and the measurement compression is fundamentally needed to achieve the optimal rate region.

abstract: There has been rapid development of systems that yield strong interactions between freely propagating photons in one dimension via controlled coupling to quantum emitters. This raises interesting possibilities such as quantum information processing with photons or quantum many-body states of light, but treating such systems generally remains a difficult task theoretically. Here, we describe a novel technique in which the dynamics and correlations of a few photons can be exactly calculated, based upon knowledge of the initial photonic state and the solution of the reduced effective dynamics of the quantum emitters alone. We show that this generalized "input-output" formalism allows for a straightforward numerical implementation regardless of system details, such as emitter positions, external driving, and level structure. As a specific example, we apply our technique to show how atomic systems with infinite-range interactions and under conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency enable the selective transmission of correlated multi-photon states.

abstract: The development of mathematically complete and consistent models solving the so-called "measurement problem", strongly renewed the interest of the scientific community for the foundations of quantum mechanics, among these the Dynamical Reduction Models posses the unique characteristic to be experimentally testable. In the first part of the paper an upper limit on the reduction rate parameter of such models will be obtained, based on the analysis of the X-ray spectrum emitted by an isolated slab of germanium and measured by the IGEX experiment. The second part of the paper is devoted to present the results of the VIP (Violation of the Pauli exclusion principle) experiment and to describe its recent upgrade. The VIP experiment established a limit on the probability that the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) is violated by electrons, using the very clean method of searching for PEP forbidden atomic transitions in copper.

abstract: The operational definition of a weak value for a quantum mechanical system involves the limit of the weak measurement strength tending to zero. I study how this limit compares to the situation for the undisturbed (no weak measurement) system. Under certain conditions, which I investigate, this limit is discontinuous in the sense that it does not merge smoothly to the Hilbert space description of the undisturbed system. Hence, in these discontinuous cases, the weak value does not represent the undisturbed system. As a result, conclusions drawn from such weak values regarding the properties of the studied system cannot be upheld. Examples are given.

We scrutinize the survival probability of this excited state for very short times, in the so-called Zeno regime, for which we show that the dynamics is dictated by a coherent --in phase -- response of the on-shell and off-shell vacuum modes. We also develop a perturbative approach in order to interpolate between different temporal regimes: the Zeno, golden rule (linear) and Wigner-Weisskopf (exponential) regimes. We compare results obtained with the $\hat{\mathbf{E}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{A}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ interaction Hamiltonian,s, using successively the dipole approximation and the exact coupling.

abstract: Quantum measurements are called incompatible if they cannot be performed together with a single device - this concept is a generalization of commutativity of projective measurements. Regarding incompatibility as a quantum resource, we define operational ways of quantifying it via the amount of added classical noise needed to render the measurements compatible. In analogy to entanglement measures, we generalize this idea in the context of binary measurements by introducing the concept of incompatibility measure, which is monotone in local operations. We then construct a family of such monotones operationally quantifying violations of certain scaled versions of the CHSH Bell inequality, prove that they can be computed via a semidefinite program, and show how the noise-based quantities arise as special cases. We also determine maximal violations of the new inequalities, demonstrating how Tsirelson's bound appears as a special case. The resource aspect is further motivated by simple quantum protocols where our incompatibility monotones appear as relevant figures of merit.

abstract: A unitary 2-design can be viewed as a quantum analogue of a 2-universal hash function: it is indistinguishable from a truly random unitary by any procedure that queries it twice. We show that exact unitary 2-designs on n qubits can be implemented by quantum circuits consisting of ~O(n) elementary gates in logarithmic depth. This is essentially a quadratic improvement in size (and in width times depth) over all previous implementations that are exact or approximate (for sufficiently strong approximations).

abstract: Bell's theorem is 50 years old. Still there is a controversy about its implications. Much of it has its roots in confusion regarding the premises from which the theorem can be derived. Some claim that a derivation of Bell's inequalities requires just locality assumption, and nothing more. Violations of the inequalities are then interpreted as ``nonlocality'' or ``quantum nonlocality''. We show that such claims are unfounded and that every derivation of Bell's inequalities requires a premise -- in addition to locality and freedom of choice -- which is either assumed tacitly, or unconsciously, or is embedded in a single compound condition (like Bell's ``local causality''). The premise is equivalent to the assumption of existence of additional variables which do not appear in the quantum formalism (in form of determinism, or joint probability for outcomes of all conceivable measurements, or ``additional causes`'', or ``hidden variables'', ``complete description of the state'' or counterfactual definiteness, etc.). A certain irony is that perhaps the main message of violation of Bell's inequalities is that our notion of locality should be based on an operationally well-defined no-signalling condition, rather than on local causality.

abstract: We develop the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach for open systems with Neumann boundary conditions. The approach can be used for calculating the scattering matrix and the scattering function in open resonator-waveguide systems. In higher than one dimensions the method represents acoustic coupled mode theory in which the scattering solution within an open resonator is found in the form of expansion over the eigenmodes of the closed resonator decoupled from the waveguides. The problem of finding the transmission spectra is reduced to solving a set of linear equations with a non-Hermitian matrix whose anti-Hermitian term accounts for coupling between the resonator eigenmodes and the scattering channels of the waveguides. Numerical applications to acoustic two-, and three-dimensional resonator-waveguide problems are considered.

abstract: A single-shot Toffoli, or controlled-controlled-NOT, gate is desirable for classical and quantum information processing. The Toffoli gate alone is universal for reversible computing and, accompanied by the Hadamard gate, forms a universal gate set for quantum computing. The Toffoli gate is also a key ingredient for (non-topological) quantum error correction. Currently Toffoli gates are achieved by decomposing into sequentially implemented single- and two-qubit gates, which requires much longer times and yields lower overall fidelities compared to a single-shot implementation. We develop a quantum-control procedure to construct a single-shot Toffoli gate for three nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting transmon systems such that the fidelity is 99.9% and is as fast as an entangling two-qubit gate under the same realistic conditions. The gate is achieved by a non-greedy quantum control procedure using our enhanced version of the Differential Evolution algorithm.

abstract: In response to recent criticisms by Okon and Sudarsky, various aspects of the consistent histories (CH) resolution of the quantum measurement problem(s) are discussed using a simple Stern-Gerlach device, and compared with the alternative approaches to the measurement problem provided by spontaneous localization (GRW), Bohmian mechanics, many worlds, and standard (textbook) quantum mechanics. Among these CH is unique in solving the second measurement problem: inferring from the measurement outcome a property of the measured system at a time before the measurement took place, as is done routinely by experimental physicists. The main respect in which CH differs from other quantum interpretations is in allowing multiple stochastic descriptions of a given measurement situation, from which one (or more) can be selected on the basis of its utility. This requires abandoning a principle (termed unicity), central to classical physics, that at any instant of time there is only a single correct description of the world.

Here we present an implementation of a Josephson junction circuit dedicated to operate as a V-shape artificial atom. Based on a concept of two internal degrees of freedom, the device consists of two transmon qubits coupled by an inductance. The Josephson nonlinearity introduces a strong diagonal coupling between the two degrees of freedom that finds applications in quantum non-demolition readout schemes, and in the realization of microwave cross-Kerr media based on superconducting circuits.

Moreover, we propose the double-encryption technique to improve its security, and the security of the improved scheme is proved to be between the original scheme and the quantum one-time pad.

According to five elements of a quantum symmetric-key encryption protocol: plaintext, ciphertext, key, encryption algorithm and decryption algorithm, there are 32 different kinds of them. Among them, 5 kinds of protocols have already been constructed and studied, and 21 kinds of them are proved to be impossible to construct, the last 6 kinds of them are not yet presented effectively. That means the research on quantum symmetric-key encryption protocol only needs to consider with 5 kinds of them nowadays.

abstract: In the present work, we consider a scenario where an arbitrary two-qubit pure state is applied to generate a randomly distributed key via the generalized EPR protocol. Using the twirling procedure to convert the pure state into a Werner state, the error rate of the key can be reduced by a factor of $2/3$. This effect indicates that entanglement is not the sufficient resource of the generalized EPR protocol since it is not increased in the twirling procedure. Instead of entanglement, the geometric discord is suggested to be the general quantum resource for this task.

By ruling out this possibility, apparently nothing seems to prevent from a realistic, noncontextual or local view of quantum mechanics.

These reported high numbers engender optimism that fault-tolerant quantum computing is within reach. Here we convert reported gate fidelity to a bound on worst-case quantum gate error rate, which is appropriate to assess scalability and is greater by orders of magnitude. We develop a classical computing model to demonstrate that our bound is classically meaningful and to elucidate the huge divide between reported and requisite gate performance.

abstract: We generalize an efficient exact synthesis algorithm for single-qubit unitaries over the Clifford+T gate set which was presented by Kliuchnikov, Maslov and Mosca. Their algorithm takes as input an exactly synthesizable single-qubit unitary--one which can be expressed without error as a product of Clifford and T gates--and outputs a sequence of gates which implements it. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that the length of the sequence, measured by the number of T gates, is smallest possible. In this paper, for each positive even integer $n$ we consider the "Clifford-cyclotomic" gate set consisting of the Clifford group plus a z-rotation by $\frac{\pi}{n}$. We present an efficient exact synthesis algorithm which outputs a decomposition using the minimum number of $\frac{\pi}{n}$ z-rotations. For the Clifford+T case $n=4$ the group of exactly synthesizable unitaries was shown to be equal to the group of unitaries with entries over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[e^{i\frac{\pi}{n}},1/2]$. We prove that this characterization holds for a handful of other small values of $n$ but the fraction of positive even integers for which it fails to hold is 100%.

abstract: In this work, strongly complementary observables are shown to provide an abstract characterisation of Fourier transform and representation theory in Categorical Quantum Mechanics. Our starting point is the observation that the Fourier transform can be seen as an isomorphism of internal monoids in $\operatorname{Hilb}$ between convolution and pointwise multiplication. We proceed to generalise the necessary tools of representation theory from $\operatorname{Hilb}$ to arbitrary $\dagger$-compact monoidal categories: we define groups, characters and representations, and we prove their relation to strong complementarity. We define the Fourier transform in terms of pairs of strongly complementary observables, in both the abelian and non-abelian case. We draw the connection with Pontryagin duality and the theory of unitary symmetries of systems, linking observables to the conserved quantities associated with dynamics. Finally, our work finds application in the novel characterisation of the Fourier transform for the category $\operatorname{Rel}$ of sets and relations. This is a result of great interest for the study of categorical quantum algorithms, as the usual construction of the quantum Fourier transform in terms of Hadamard matrices is shown to fail in $\operatorname{Rel}$.

To investigate the critical behaviour of such systems we employ tools from quantum information theory. Specifically, we show that the local quantum uncertainty, a quantity introduced in order to quantify the minimum quantum share of the variance of a local measurement, can be used to indicate quantum phase transitions presented by these models at zero temperature. Due to the connection of this quantity with the quantum Fisher information, the results presented here may be relevant for quantum metrology and quantum thermodynamics.

abstract: Closed timelike curves are among the most controversial features of modern physics. As legitimate solutions to Einstein's field equations, they allow for time travel, which instinctively seems paradoxical. However, in the quantum regime these paradoxes can be resolved leaving closed timelike curves consistent with relativity. The study of these systems therefore provides valuable insight into non-linearities and the emergence of causal structures in quantum mechanics-essential for any formulation of a quantum theory of gravity. Here we experimentally simulate the non-linear behaviour of a qubit interacting unitarily with an older version of itself, addressing some of the fascinating effects that arise in systems traversing a closed timelike curve. These include perfect discrimination of non-orthogonal states and, most intriguingly, the ability to distinguish nominally equivalent ways of preparing pure quantum states. Finally, we examine the dependence of these effects on the initial qubit state, the form of the unitary interaction, and the influence of decoherence.

Here one is given $n$ copies of a mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ and the goal is to distinguish whether $\rho$'s spectrum satisfies some property $\mathcal{P}$ or is at least $\epsilon$-far in $\ell_1$-distance from satisfying $\mathcal{P}$. This problem was promoted in the survey of Montanaro and de Wolf under the name of testing unitarily invariant properties of mixed states. It is the natural quantum analogue of the classical problem of testing symmetric properties of probability distributions. Here, the hope is for algorithms with subquadratic copy complexity in the dimension $d$. This is because the "empirical Young diagram (EYD) algorithm" can estimate the spectrum of a mixed state up to $\epsilon$-accuracy using only $\widetilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies. In this work, we show that given a mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$: (i) $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to test whether $\rho$ is the maximally mixed state, i.e., has spectrum $(\frac1d, ..., \frac1d)$; (ii) $\Theta(r^2/\epsilon)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to test with one-sided error whether $\rho$ has rank $r$, i.e., has at most $r$ nonzero eigenvalues; (iii) $\widetilde{\Theta}(r^2/\Delta)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to distinguish whether $\rho$ is maximally mixed on an $r$-dimensional or an $(r+\Delta)$-dimensional subspace; and (iv) The EYD algorithm requires $\Omega(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies to estimate the spectrum of $\rho$ up to $\epsilon$-accuracy, nearly matching the known upper bound. In addition, we simplify part of the proof of the upper bound. Our techniques involve the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric group; in particular Kerov's algebra of polynomial functions on Young diagrams.

abstract: Physical Realizability addresses the question of whether it is possible to implement a given linear time invariant (LTI) system as a quantum system. A given synthesized quantum controller described by a set of stochastic differential equations does not necessarily correspond to a physically meaningful quantum system. However, if additional quantum noises are permitted in the implementation, it is always possible to implement an arbitrary LTI system as a quantum system. In this paper, we give an expression for the number of introduced noise channels required to implement a given LTI system as a quantum system. We then consider the special case where only the transfer function to be implemented is of interest. We give results showing when it is possible to implement a transfer function as a quantum system by introducing the same number of quantum noises as there are system outputs. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these results by providing an algorithm for obtaining a suboptimal solution to a coherent quantum LQG control problem.

abstract: The spin-boson model is a paradigm for studying decoherence, relaxation, entanglement and other effects that arise in a quantum system coupled to environmental degrees of freedom. At zero temperature, a localization-delocalization phase transition is known to exist in the sub-Ohmic regime, where the standard density matrix renormalization group algorithm is inadequate due to the divergence in the number of low-frequency modes. This limitation is circumvented in this work by symmetrically optimizing the phonon basis and introducing an order parameter accounting for the U(1) symmetry for a two-bath spin-boson model, by which we are able to determine the classification and criticality of the phase transition explicitly. Compared with variational results, the critical phase is characterized by spontaneous vanishing of boson displacements in both the baths, resulting in an accurate phase diagram with three model parameters.

abstract: We report an experimental implementation of a single-qubit generalised measurement scenario(POVM) based on a quantum walk model. The qubit is encoded in a single-photon polarisation. The photon performs a quantum walk on an array of optical elements, where the polarisation-dependent translation is performed via birefringent beam displacers and a change of the polarisation is implemented with the help of wave-plates. We implement: (i) Trine-POVM, i.e., the POVM elements uniformly distributed on an equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere; (ii) Symmetric-Informationally- Complete (SIC) POVM; and (iii) Unambiguous Discrimination of two non-orthogonal qubit states.

abstract: We investigate superradiant cascade emissions from an atomic ensemble driven by two-color classical fields. The correlated pair of photons (signal and idler) is generated by adiabatically driving the system with large-detuned light fields via four-wave mixing. The signal photon from the upper transition of the diamond-type atomic levels is followed by the idler one which can be superradiant due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. We then calculate the cooperative Lamb shift (CLS) of the idler photon, which is a cumulative effect of interaction energy.We study its dependence on a cylindrical geometry, a conventional setup in cold atom experiments, and estimate the maximum CLS which can be significant and observable. Manipulating the CLS of cascade emissions enables frequency qubits that provide alternative robust elements in quantum network.

abstract: We propose an efficient method to filter out single atoms from trapped ensembles with unknown number of atoms. The method employs stimulated adiabatic passage to reversibly transfer a single atom to the Rydberg state which blocks subsequent Rydberg excitation of all the other atoms within the ensemble. This triggers the excitation of Rydberg blockaded atoms to short lived intermediate states and their subsequent decay to untrapped states. Using an auxiliary microwave field to carefully engineer the dissipation, we obtain a nearly deterministic single-atom source. Our method is applicable to small atomic ensembles in individual microtraps and in lattice arrays.

We provide su?cient conditions which guarantee that the corresponding memory kernel generates physically legitimate quantum evolution. Interestingly, we are able to recover several well known examples and generate new classes of nontrivial qubit evolution. Surprisingly, it turns out that quantum evolution with memory kernel generated by our approach gives rise to vanishing non-Markovianity measure based on the distinguishability of quantum states.

abstract: We investigate the interaction of metastable 2S hydrogen atoms with a perfectly conducting wall, including parity-breaking S-P mixing terms (with full account of retardation). The neighboring 2P_1/2 and 2P_3/2 levels are found to have a profound effect on the transition from the short-range, nonrelativistic regime, to the retarded form of the Casimir-Polder interaction. The corresponding P state admixtures to the metastable 2S state are calculated. We find the long-range asymptotics of the retarded Casimir-Polder potentials and mixing amplitudes, for general excited states, including a fully quantum electrodynamic treatment of the dipole-quadrupole mixing term. The decay width of the metastable 2S state is roughly doubled even at a comparatively large distance of 918 atomic units (Bohr radii) from the perfect conductor. The magnitude of the calculated effects is compared to the unexplained Sokolov effect.

abstract: Nonclassicality, entanglement, as well as dimensionality of a noisy twin beam are determined using characteristic function of the beam written in the Fock basis. One-to-one correspondence between the negativity quantifying entanglement and the nonclassicality depth is revealed. Twin beams, which are either entangled or nonclassical (independent of their entanglement), are observed only for the limited degrees of noise that degrades their quantumness. Dimensionality of the twin beam quantified by the participation ratio is compared with the dimensionality of entanglement determined from the negativity. The partition of the degrees of freedom of the twin beam into those related to entanglement and to noise is suggested. Both single-mode and multimode twin beams are analyzed. Weak nonclassicality based on integrated-intensity quasidistributions of multimode twin beams is studied. Relation of the model to the experimental twin beams is discussed.

abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is considered by most authors as a quantum effect, but a generally accepted explanation does not seem to be available. The phenomenon is studied here under the assumption that hypothetical electric dipole distributions configured by moving charges in the solenoid act on the electrons as test particles. The relative motions of the interacting charged particles introduce relativistic time dilations. The massless dipoles are postulated as part of an impact model that has recently been proposed to account for the far-reaching electrostatic forces between charged particles described by Coulomb's law. The model provides a quantitative explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

abstract: Nowadays, geometric tools are being used to treat a huge class of problems of quantum information science. By understanding the interplay between the geometry of the state space and information-theoretic quantities, it is possible to obtain less trivial and more robust physical constraints on quantum systems. In this sense, here we establish a geometric lower bound for the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI), a well-known information theoretic quantity recently recognized as a proper quantum coherence measure. Starting from a mixed state evolving under unitary dynamics, while WYSI is a constant of motion, the lower bound indicates the rate of change of quantum statistical distinguishability between initial and final states. Our result shows that, since WYSI fits in the class of Petz metrics, this lower bound is the change rate of its respective geodesic distance on quantum state space. The geometric approach is advantageous because raises several physical interpretations of this inequality under the same theoretical umbrella.

abstract: We prove that magic states from the Clifford hierarchy give optimal solutions for tasks involving nonlocality and entropic uncertainty with respect to Pauli measurements. For both the nonlocality and uncertainty tasks, stabilizer states are the worst possible pure states so our solutions have an operational interpretation as being highly non-stabilizer. The optimal strategy for a qudit version of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game in prime dimensions is achieved by measuring maximally entangled states that are isomorphic to single-qudit magic states. These magic states have an appealingly simple form and our proof shows that they are "balanced" with respect to all but one of the mutually unbiased stabilizer bases. Of all equatorial qudit states, magic states minimize the average entropic uncertainties for collision entropy and also, for small prime dimensions, min-entropy -- a fact that may have implications for cryptography.

abstract: It is theoretically and experimentally shown that photons emitted by statistically independent incoherent classical light sources and measured in the far field in spatially separated modes may display spatial correlations akin to path-entanglement of photons produced by quantum sources. By measuring higher order photon-correlations at different locations, i.e., $m$ photons in one mode and one photon in another mode, we experimentally demonstrate for $m \geq 6$ a violation of Bell-type inequalities for spatial degrees of freedom. The spatial correlations among the photons can be understood from state projection where the detection of the first $m$ photons projects the sources onto a state which emits the subsequent photon in a strongly correlated manner. From this perspective the entanglement and violation of Bell's inequalities appears as a consequence of nonvanishing cross correlations between noncommuting quadrature phase components of the two spatially separated fields after $m$ photons have been recorded. In this way we show that classical systems may produce spatial field correlations violating local realistic theories.

The control of the echo emission is attributed to the spatial gradient induced by the light-shift beam.

abstract: We develop a new method of representation of quantum states in terms of the displaced number states. We call it representation, where is an amplitude of the base displaced states. In particular, representation was obtained for set of the displaced number states with different amplitude of the displacement, two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) and superposition of vacuum and single photon. The treatment is employed for building of elementary linear operators, in particular, two-qubit control-sign gate, Hadamard matrix between two two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Main idea underlying the method is extraction of the displaced number state from initial state. Coherent qubit with large amplitude taken simultaneously two modes shifts two-mode target qubit on phase plane and constructive interference appears after measurement of single photon. The results are exact, any approximations are not exploited. We show implementation of the gates with almost unity fidelity of the output states is possible in realistic scenario.

abstract: We propose orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), as a spectrally efficient multiplexing technique, for quantum key distribution (QKD) at the core of trustednode quantum networks. Two main schemes are proposed and analyzed in detail, considering system imperfections, specifically, time misalignment issues. It turns out that while multiple service providers can share the network infrastructure using the proposed multiplexing techniques, no gain in the total secret key generation is obtained if one uses conventional all-optical passive OFDM decoders. To achieve a linear increase in the key rate with the number of channels, an alternative active setup for OFDM decoding is proposed, which employs an optical switch instead of conventional passive circuits. The performance of the latter system will also be analyzed in the presence of system imperfections.

Here, we show theoretically that, some effects due to the weak interactions present only in the properly post-selected sub-ensemble, however are canceled by themselves in the total ensemble. From this point of view, the post-selection induced weak value could be one of the feasible methods for measuring the weak interaction, since the standard measurement does not work. Additionally, we employ the system of trapped ions to simulate the weak measurement and calculate relevant results without the frequently-used weak interaction approximation.

abstract: The problem of time is a deep paradox in our physical description of the world. According to Aristotle's relational theory, time is a measure of change and does not exist on its own. In contrast, quantum mechanics, just like Newtonian mechanics, is equipped with a master clock that dictates the evolution of a system. This clock is infinitely precise and tacitly supplied free of charge from outside physics. Not only does this absolute time make it notoriously difficult to make a consistent theory of quantum gravity, it is also the underlying problem in establishing the second law. Indeed, contrary to our experience, the Wheeler-deWitt equation --a canonical quantization of general relativity-- predicts a static universe. Similarly, when simply concerned with the dynamics of a closed quantum system, there is no second law because the Von Neumann entropy is invariant under unitary transformations. Here we are mainly concerned with the latter problem and we show that it can be resolved by attributing a minimal amount of resources to the measurement of time. Although there is an absolute time in quantum mechanics, an observer can only establish a time by measuring a clock. For a local measurement, the minimal entropy production is equal to the number of ticks. This lower bound is attained by a black hole.

In secret sharing protocols, a message is divided into shares given to recipient parties in such a way that some number of parties need to collaborate in order to reconstruct the message. Quantum protocols for the task commonly rely on multipartite entanglement. We present a multiparty quantum secret sharing protocol which requires only sequential communication of a single $d$-level system (for any prime $d$). It is scalable and can be realized with the state of the art technology.

abstract: The ability to trap and guide coherent electrons is gaining importance in fundamental as well as in applied physics. In this regard novel quantum devices are currently developed that may operate under low vacuum conditions. Here we study the loss of electron coherence with increasing background gas pressure. Thereby, optionally helium, hydrogen or nitrogen is introduced in a biprism interferometer where the interference contrast is a measure for the coherence of the electrons. The results indicate a constant contrast that is not decreasing in the examined pressure range between $10^{-9}$ mbar and $10^{-4}$ mbar. Therefore, no decoherence was observed even under poor vacuum conditions. Due to scattering of the electron beam with background H$_2$-molecules a signal loss of 94 % was determined. The results may lower the vacuum requirements for novel quantum devices with free coherent electrons.

abstract: A short quantum Markov chain is a tripartite state $\rho_{ABC}$ such that system $A$ can be recovered perfectly by acting on system $C$ of the reduced state $\rho_{BC}$. Such states have conditional mutual information $I(A;B|C)$ equal to zero and are the only states with this property. A quantum channel $\mathcal{N}$ is sufficient for two states $\rho$ and $\sigma$ if there exists a recovery channel using which one can perfectly recover $\rho$ from $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ and $\sigma$ from $\mathcal{N}(\sigma)$. The relative entropy difference $D(\rho\Vert\sigma)-D(\mathcal{N}(\rho)\Vert\mathcal{N}(\sigma))$ is equal to zero if and only if $\mathcal{N}$ is sufficient for $\rho$ and $\sigma$. In this paper, we show that these properties extend to Renyi generalizations of these information measures which were proposed in [Berta et al., J. Math. Phys. 56, 022205, (2015) and arXiv:1410.1443], thus providing an alternate characterization of short quantum Markov chains and sufficient quantum channels. These results give further support to these quantities as being legitimate Renyi generalizations of the conditional mutual information and the relative entropy difference. Along the way, we solve some open questions of Ruskai and Zhang, regarding the trace of particular matrices that arise in the study of monotonicity of relative entropy under quantum operations and strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy.

abstract: Non-locality, or quantum-non-locality, are buzzwords in the community of quantum foundation and information scientists, which purportedly describe the implications of Bell's theorem. When such phrases are treated seriously, that is it is claimed that Bell's theorem reveals non-locality as an inherent trait of the quantum description of the micro-world, this leads to logical contradictions, which will be discussed here. In fact, Bell's theorem, understood as violation of Bell inequalities by quantum predictions, is consistent with Bohr's notion of complementarity. Thus, if it points to anything, then it is rather the significance of the principle of Bohr, but even this is not a clear implication. Non-locality is a necessary consequence of Bell's theorem only if we reject complementarity by adopting some form of realism, be it additional hidden variables, additional hidden causes, etc., or counterfactual definiteness. The essay contains two largely independent parts. The first one is addressed to any reader interested in the topic. The second, discussing the notion of local causality, is addressed to people working in the field.

abstract: We consider a many-body generalization of the Kapitza pendulum: the periodically-driven sine-Gordon model. We show that this interacting system is dynamically stable to periodic drives with finite frequency and amplitude. This finding is in contrast to the common belief that periodically-driven unbounded interacting systems should always tend to an absorbing infinite-temperature state. The transition to an unstable absorbing state is described by a change in the sign of the kinetic term in the effective Floquet Hamiltonian and controlled by the short-wavelength degrees of freedom. We investigate the stability phase diagram through an analytic high-frequency expansion, a self-consistent variational approach, and a numeric semiclassical calculations. Classical and quantum experiments are proposed to verify the validity of our results.

The resonator structure can enhance spontaneous four wave mixing, leading to a photon pair generation rate of about 90-100 Hz with a laser pump power of as low as -3.92 dBm (0.41 mW). We succeed in observing time-bin entanglement with the visibility over 92%. Moreover, wavelength-tunability of the entangled photon pair is demonstrated by changing the operation temperature.

abstract: We theoretically show the negative refraction existing in M\"{o}bius molecules. The negative refractive index is induced by the non-trivial topology of the molecules. With the M\"{o}bius boundary condition, the effective electromagnetic fields felt by the electron in a M\"{o}bius ring is spatially inhomogeneous. In this regard, the $D_{N}$ symmetry is broken in M\"{o}bius molecules and thus the magnetic response is induced through the effective magnetic field. Our findings open up a new architecture for negative refractive index materials based on the non-trivial topology of M\"{o}bius molecules.

abstract: We address a broad class of optimization problems of finding quantum measurements, which includes the problems of finding an optimal measurement in the Bayes criterion and a measurement maximizing the average success probability with a fixed rate of inconclusive results. Our approach can deal with any problem in which each of the objective and constraint functions is formulated by the sum of the traces of the multiplication of a Hermitian operator and a detection operator. We first derive dual problems and necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal measurement. We also consider the minimax version of these problems and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a minimax solution. Finally, for optimization problem having a certain symmetry, there exists an optimal solution with the same symmetry. Examples are shown to illustrate how our results can be used.

abstract: Clock synchronization for nonfaulty processes in multiprocess networks is indispensable for a variety of technologies. A reliable system must be able to resynchronize the nonfaulty processes upon some components failing causing the distribution of incorrect or conflicting information in the network. The task of synchronizing such networks is related to detectable Byzantine agreement (DBA), which can classically be solved using recursive algorithms if and only if less than one-third of the processes are faulty. Here we introduce a nonrecursive quantum algorithm that solves the DBA and achieves clock synchronization in the presence of arbitrary many faulty processes by using only a single quantum system.

abstract: The primary quantum mechanical equation of motion entails that measurements typically do not have determinate outcomes, but result in superpositions of all possible outcomes. Dynamical collapse theories (e.g. GRW) supplement this equation with a stochastic Gaussian collapse function, intended to collapse the superposition of outcomes into one outcome. But the Gaussian collapses are imperfect in a way that leaves the superpositions intact. This is the tails problem. There are several ways of making this problem more precise. But many authors dismiss the problem without considering the more severe formulations. Here I distinguish four distinct tails problems. The first (bare tails problem) and second (structured tails problem) exist in the literature. I argue that while the first is a pseudo-problem, the second has not been adequately addressed. The third (multiverse tails problem) reformulates the second to account for recently discovered dynamical consequences of collapse. Finally the fourth (tails problem dilemma) shows that solving the third by replacing the Gaussian with a non-Gaussian collapse function introduces new conflict with relativity theory.

abstract: Bohmian mechanics, a hydrodynamic formulation of the quantum theory, constitutes a useful tool to understand the role of the phase as the mechanism responsible for the dynamical evolution displayed by quantum systems. This role is analyzed and discussed here in the context of quantum interference, considering to this end two well-known scenarios, namely Young's two-slit experiment and Wheeler's delayed choice experiment. A numerical implementation of the first scenario is used to show how interference in a coherent superposition of two counter-propagating wave packets can be seen and explained in terms of an effective model consisting of a single wave packet scattered off an attractive hard wall. The outcomes from this model are then applied to the analysis of Wheeler's delayed choice experiment, also recreated by means of a reliable realistic simulation. Both examples illustrate quite well how the Bohmian formulation helps to explain in a natural way (and therefore to demystify) aspects of the quantum theory typically regarded as paradoxical. In other words, they show that a proper understanding of quantum phase dynamics immediately removes any trace of unnecessary artificial wave-particle arguments.

abstract: Double-dot exchange-only qubit represents a promising compromise between high speed and simple fabrication in solid-state implementations. A couple of interacting double-dot exchange-only qubits, each composed by three electrons distributed in a double quantum dot, is exploited to realize controlled-NOT (CNOT) operations. The effective Hamiltonian model of the composite system is expressed by only exchange interactions between pairs of spins. Consequently, the evolution operator has a simple form and represents the starting point for the research of sequences of operations that realize CNOT gates. Two different geometrical configurations of the pair are considered, and a numerical mixed simplex and genetic algorithm is used. We compare the nonphysical case in which all the interactions are controllable from the external and the realistic condition in which intra-dot interactions are fixed by the geometry of the system. In the latter case, we find the CNOT sequences for both the geometrical configurations and we considered a qubit system where electrons are electrostatically confined in two quantum dots in a silicon nanowire. The effects of the geometrical sizes of the nanowire and of the gates on the fundamental parameters controlling the qubit are studied by exploiting a spin-density-functional theory-based simulator. Consequently, CNOT gate performances are evaluated.

abstract: Discrete time quantum walks (DTQWs) are nontrivial generalizations of random walks with a broad scope of applications. In particular, they can be used as computational primitives, and they are suitable tools for simulating other quantum systems. DTQWs usually spread ballistically due to their quantumness. In some cases, however, they can remain localized at their initial state (trapping). The trapping and other fundamental properties of DTQWs are determined by the choice of the coin operator. We introduce and analyze an up to now uncharted type of walks driven by a coin class leading to strong trapping, complementing the known list of walks. This class of walks exhibit a number of exciting properties with the possible applications ranging from light pulse trapping in a medium to topological effects and quantum search.

abstract: A protocol is discussed which allows one to realize a transducer for single photons between the optical and the microwave frequency range. The transducer is a spin ensemble, where the individual emitters possess both an optical and a magnetic-dipole transition. Reversible frequency conversion is realized by combining optical photon storage, by means of EIT, with the controlled switching of the coupling between the magnetic-dipole transition and a superconducting qubit, which is realized by means of a microwave cavity. The efficiency is quantified by the global fidelity for transferring coherently a qubit excitation between a single optical photon and the superconducting qubit. We test various strategies and show that the total efficiency is essentially limited by the optical quantum memory: It can exceed 80% for ensembles of NV centers and approaches 99% for cold atomic ensembles, assuming state-of-the-art experimental parameters. This protocol allows one to bridge the gap between the optical and the microwave regime so to efficiently combine superconducting and optical components in quantum networks.

The goal of our scheme is to achieve information-theoretic security, and the security analysis is also given.

abstract: Quantum superposition states are behind many of the curious phenomena exhibited by quantum systems, including Bell non-locality, quantum interference, quantum computational speed-up, and the measurement problem. However, many qualitative properties of quantum superpositions can also be observed in classical probability distributions leading to a suspicion that superpositions may be explicable as probability distributions over less problematic states; that is, a suspicion that superpositions are \emph{epistemic}. Here, it is proved that, for any quantum system of dimension $d>3$, this cannot be the case for almost all superpositions. Equivalently, any underlying ontology must contain ontic superposition states. A related question concerns general possibility of non-orthogonal quantum states $|\psi\rangle,|\phi\rangle$ being ontologically indistinct. A similar method proves that if $|\langle\phi|\psi\rangle|^{2}\in(0,\frac{1}{4})$ then $|\psi\rangle,|\phi\rangle$ must approach ontological distinctness as $d\rightarrow\infty$. The robustness of these results to small experimental error is also discussed.

abstract: In this paper the geometry of two and three-qubit states under local unitary groups is discussed. We first review the one qubit geometry and its relation with Riemanian sphere under the action of group $SU(2)$. We show that the second Hopf fiberation intertwines between local unitary group $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ and quaternionic M\"obius transformation. The invariant term appearing in this operation is related to concurrence measure. Yet, there exists the same intertwining Hopf map for much more global group $Sp(2)$, generalizing the familiar Bloch sphere in 2-level systems. Subsequently, we introduce third Hopf fiberation and octonionic conformal map (or octonionic M\"obius maps) for three-qubit states and find evidence that they may have invariant terms under local unitary operations which shows that both maps have entanglement sensitive.

abstract: We explain probe field transmission spectrum under the influence of a strong pump field in a hybrid optomechanical system, composed of an optical cavity, a mechanical resonator and a two-level atom. We show fast (superluminal) and slow (subluminal) light effects of the transmitted probe field in the hybrid system for suitable parametric regimes. For experimental accessible domain, we find that the fast light effect obtained for the single optomechanical coupling, can further be enhanced with the additional atom-field coupling in the hybrid system. Furthermore, we report the existence of a tunable switch from fast to slow light by adjusting the atomic detuning with the anti-Stokes and Stokes sidebands respectively, as $\Delta_a=+\omega_m$ and $-\omega_m$. The reported characteristics are realizable in state-of-the-art laboratory experiments.

abstract: We identify a nontrivial multistate Landau-Zener model for which transition probabilities between any pair of diabatic states can be determined analytically and exactly. In the semiclassical picture, this model features the possibility of interference of different trajectories that connect the same initial and final states. Hence, transition probabilities are generally not described by the incoherent successive application of the Landau-Zener formula. We discuss reasons for integrability of this system and provide numerical tests of the suggested expression for the transition probability matrix.

abstract: We introduce a probability current analysis of excitation energy transfer between states of an open quantum system. Expressing the energy transfer through currents of excitation probability between the states in a site representation enables us to gain key insights into the energy transfer dynamics. It allows to, i) identify the pathways of energy transport in large networks of sites and to quantify their relative weights, ii) quantify the respective contributions of unitary dynamics, dephasing, and relaxation/dissipation processes to the energy transfer, and iii) quantify the contribution of coherence to the energy transfer. Our analysis is general and can be applied to a broad range of open quantum system descriptions (with coupling to non-Markovian environments) in a straightforward manner.

abstract: We propose a definitive test of whether plates involved in Casimir experiments should be modeled with ballistic or diffusive electrons--a prominent controversy highlighted by a number of conflicting experiments. The unambiguous test we propose is a measurement of the Casimir force between a disordered quasi-2D metallic plate and a three-dimensional metallic system at low temperatures, in which disorder-induced weak localization effects modify the well-known Drude result in an experimentally tunable way. We calculate the weak localization correction to the Casimir force as a function of magnetic field and temperature and demonstrate that the quantum interference suppression of the Casimir force is a strong, observable effect. The coexistence of weak localization suppression in electronic transport and Casimir pressure would lend credence to the Drude theory of the Casimir effect, while the lack of such correlation would indicate a fundamental problem with the existing theory. We also study mesoscopic disorder fluctuations in the Casimir effect and estimate the width of the distribution of Casmir energies due to disorder fluctuations.

It is shown that so constructed basis is equivalent to the space of the Dirac states relied on the use of quantum numbers k_{1}, k_{2}, \pm k and helicity operator; linear transformations relating these two spaces are found. Application of the squaring method substantially depends on the choice of representation for the Dirac matrices, some features of this are considered. Peculiarities of applying the squaring method in Majorana representation are investigated as well. The constructed bases are relevant to describe the Casimir effect for Dirac and Weyl fields in the domain restricted by two planes.

abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are the most sensitive instruments for light detection. In the near-infrared range, SPDs based on III-V compound semiconductor avalanche photodiodes have been extensively used during the past two decades for diverse applications due to their advantages in practicality including small size, low cost and easy operation. In the past decade, the rapid developments and increasing demands in quantum information science have served as key drivers to improve the device performance of single-photon avalanche diodes and to invent new avalanche quenching techniques. This Review aims to introduce the technology advances of InGaAs/InP single-photon detector systems in the telecom wavelengths and the relevant quantum communication applications, and particularly to highlight recent emerging techniques such as high-frequency gating at GHz rates and free-running operation using negative-feedback avalanche diodes. Future perspectives of both the devices and quenching techniques are summarized.

abstract: Spin echo is a powerful technique to extend atomic or nuclear coherence time by overcoming the dephasing due to inhomogeneous broadening. However, applying this technique to an ensemble-based quantum memory at single-quanta level remains challenging. In our experimental study we find that noise due to imperfection of the rephasing pulses is highly directional. By properly arranging the beam directions and optimizing the pulse fidelities, we have successfully managed to operate the spin echo technique in the quantum regime and observed nonclassical photon-photon correlations. In comparison to the case without applying the rephasing pulses, quantum memory lifetime is extended by 5 folds. Our work for the first time demonstrates the feasibility of harnessing the spin echo technique to extend lifetime of ensemble-based quantum memories at single-quanta level.

abstract: Entangling independent photons is not only of fundamental interest but also of crucial importance for quantum information science. Two-photon interference is a major method to entangle independent identical photons. If two photons are color-different, perfect two-photon coalescence cannot happen anymore, which makes the entangling of color-different photons difficult to realize. In this letter by exploring and developing time-resolved measurement and active feed-forward, we have entangled two independent photons of different colors for the first time. We find that entanglement with a varying form can be identified for different two-photon temporal modes through time-resolved measurement. By using active feed-forward we are able to convert the varying entanglement into uniform. Adopting these measures, we have successfully entangled two photons with a frequency separation of 16 times larger than their linewidths. In addition to its fundamental interest, our work also provides an approach to solve the frequency mismatch problem for future quantum networks.

abstract: Solving realistic quantum systems coupled to an environment is a challenging task. Here we develop a hierarchical functional derivative (HFD) approach for efficiently solving the non-Markovian quantum trajectories of an open quantum system embedded in a bosonic bath. An explicit expression for arbitrary order HFD equation is derived systematically. Moreover, it is found that for an analytically solvable model, this hierarchical equation naturally terminates at a given order and thus becomes exactly solvable. This HFD approach provides a systematic method to study the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of an open system coupled to a bosonic environment.

abstract: An entangled basis with fixed Schmidt number $k$ (EBk) is a set of orthonormal basis states with the same Schmidt number $k$ in a product Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d'}$. It is a generalization of both the product basis and the maximally entangled basis. We show here that, for any $k\leq\min\{d,d'\}$, EBk exists in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d'}$ for any $d$ and $d'$. Consequently, general methods of constructing SEBk (EBk with the same Schmidt coefficients) and EBk (but not SEBk) are proposed. Moreover, we extend the concept of EBk to multipartite case and find out that the multipartite EBk can be constructed similarly.

abstract: Birth of objective properties from subjective quantum world has been one of the key questions in the quantum-to-classical transition. Basing on recent results in the field, we study it in a quantum mechanical model of a boson-boson interaction-quantum Brownian motion. Using various simplifications we prove a formation for thermal environments of, so called, spectrum broadcast structures, responsible for perceived objectivity. In the quantum measurement limit we prove that this structure is always formed, providing the characteristic timescales. Including self-Hamiltonians of the environment, we show the exponential scaling of the effect with the size of the environment. Finally, in the full model we numerically study the influence of squeezing in the initial state of the environment, showing broader regions of formation than for non-squeezed thermal states.

abstract: Quantum correlations between spatially separated parts of a $d$-dimensional bipartite system ($d\geq 2$) have no classical analog. Such correlations, also called entanglements, are not only conceptually important, but also have a profound impact on information science. In theory the violation of Bell inequalities based on local realistic theories for $d$-dimensional systems provides evidence of quantum nonlocality. Experimental verification is required to confirm whether a quantum system of extremely large dimension can possess this feature, however it has never been performed for large dimension (e.g., $d\geq 1000$). Here, we report that Bell inequalities are experimentally violated for bipartite quantum systems of extremely high dimensionality with the usual ensembles of polarization-entangled photon pairs. Our entanglement source violates Bell inequalities for extremely high dimensionality of $d>4000$. The designed scenario offers a possible new method to investigate the entanglement of multipartite systems of large dimensionality and their application in quantum information processing.

abstract: Escaping from a complex maze, by exploring different paths with several decision-making branches in order to reach the exit, has always been a very challenging and fascinating task. Wave field and quantum objects may explore a complex structure in parallel by interference effects, but without necessarily leading to more efficient transport. Here, inspired by recent observations in biological energy transport phenomena, we demonstrate how a quantum walker can efficiently reach the output of a maze by partially suppressing the presence of interference. In particular, we show theoretically an unprecedented improvement in transport efficiency for increasing maze size with respect to purely quantum and classical approaches. In addition, we investigate experimentally these hybrid transport phenomena, by mapping the maze problem in an integrated waveguide array, probed by coherent light, hence successfully testing our theoretical results. These achievements may lead towards future bio-inspired photonics technologies for more efficient transport and computation.

abstract: Applying ideas from monadic dynamics to the well-established framework of categorical quantum mechanics, we provide a novel toolbox for the simulation of finite-dimensional quantum dynamics. We use strongly complementary structures to give a graphical characterisation of quantum clocks, their action on systems and the relevant energy observables, and we proceed to formalise the connection between unitary dynamics and projection-valued spectra. We identify the Weyl canonical commutation relations in the axioms of strong complementarity, and conclude the existence of a dual pair of time/energy observables for finite-dimensional quantum clocks, with the relevant uncertainty principle given by mutual unbias of the corresponding orthonormal bases. We show that Schr\"odinger's equation can be abstractly formulated as characterising the Fourier transforms of certain Eilenberg-Moore morphisms from a quantum clock to a quantum dynamical system, and we use this to obtain a generalised version of the Feynman's clock construction. We tackle the issue of synchronism of clocks and systems, prove conservation of total energy and give conditions for the existence of an internal time observable for a quantum dynamical system. Finally, we identify our treatment as part of a more general theory of simulated symmetries of quantum systems (of which our clock actions are a special case) and their conservation laws (of which energy is a special case).

abstract: We report on experiments with a microfabricated surface trap designed for trapping a chain of ions in a ring. Uniform ion separation over most of the ring is achieved with a rotationally symmetric design and by measuring and suppressing undesired electric fields. After minimizing these fields the ions are confined primarily by an rf trapping pseudo-potential and their mutual Coulomb repulsion. The ring-shaped crystal consists of approximately 400 Ca$^+$ ions with an estimated average separation of 9 $\mu m$.

abstract: We introduce a non-commutative generalization of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for one-dimensional quantum field theories. This generalization is obtained by applying the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle to the variational manifold of continuous matrix product states. This allows for a full quantum description of the many body system including entanglement and correlations and thus extends significantly beyond the usual mean-field description of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is known to fail for one-dimensional systems.

abstract: Interacting spin models are remarkably useful for describing different types of physical, chemical, and biological systems. A key feature that makes them amenable for theoretical investigations is their finite number of degrees of freedom per particle. Significant understanding of their equilibrium properties has been achieved, especially of spin models with short-range couplings. However, progress towards the development of a comparable understanding in long-range interacting models, in particular out of equilibrium, remains limited. In a recent work, we proposed a semiclassical numerical method to study spin models, the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), and demonstrated its capability to correctly capture the dynamics of one- and two-point correlations in one dimensional (1D) systems. Here we go one step forward and use the dTWA method to study the dynamics of correlations in 2D systems with many spins and different types of long-range couplings, in regimes where other numerical methods are generally unreliable. We compute spatial and time-dependent correlations and provide bounds for the propagation velocity of information through the system. A sharp change in the speed of propagation of correlations is found at a critical range of interactions determined by the system dimension. Our predictions are relevant for a broad range of systems including solids, atom-photon systems and ultracold gases of polar molecules, trapped ions, Rydberg, and magnetic atoms. We validate the dTWA for small systems, and in the context of quantum simulation, experiments will be needed to confirm our predictions for large systems.

abstract: Caldeira-Leggett model of reservoir is generalized to a reservoir modeled by a continuum of real Klein-Gordon fields, instead of harmonic oscillators. A quantum Langevin type dissipative equation is obtained for the scalar field. The susceptibility of the medium is defined in terms of the reservoir Green's function and the coupling function satisfying causality condition. The connection between the coupling function and the susceptibility of the medium is found to be a Hankel transform from which the coupling function can be determined in terms of the susceptibility of the medium. Noise currents and their fluctuation-dissipation relation are obtained. In a homogeneous medium or reservoir, explicit form of the quantum scalar field, and its large-time limit, are found.

abstract: We present a model for decoherence in time-dependent transport. It boils down into a form of wave function that undergoes a smooth stochastic drift of the phase in a local basis, the Quantum Drift (QD) model. This drift is nothing else but a local energy fluctuation. Unlike Quantum Jumps (QJ) models, no jumps are present in the density as the evolution is unitary. As a first application, we address the transport through a resonant state $\left\vert 0\right\rangle $ that undergoes decoherence. We show the equivalence with the decoherent steady state transport in presence of a B\"{u}ttiker's voltage probe. In order to test the dynamics, we consider two many-spin systems whith a local energy fluctuation. A two-spin system is reduced to a two level system (TLS) that oscillates among $\left\vert 0\right\rangle $ $\equiv $ $ \left\vert \uparrow \downarrow \right\rangle $ and $\left\vert 1\right\rangle \equiv $ $\left\vert \downarrow \uparrow \right\rangle $. We show that QD model recovers not only the exponential damping of the oscillations in the low perturbation regime, but also the non-trivial bifurcation of the damping rates at a critical point, i.e. the quantum dynamical phase transition. We also address the spin-wave like dynamics of local polarization in a spin chain. The QD average solution has about half the dispersion respect to the mean dynamics than QJ. By evaluating the Loschmidt Echo (LE), we find that the pure states $\left\vert 0\right\rangle $ and $\left\vert 1\right \rangle $ are quite robust against the local decoherence. In contrast, the LE, and hence coherence, decays faster when the system is in a superposition state. Because its simple implementation, the method is well suited to assess decoherent transport problems as well as to include decoherence in both one-body and many-body dynamics.

abstract: Entanglement is an essential resource for quantum information, quantum computation and quantum communication. While small entangled states of few particles have been used to demonstrate non-locality of nature and elementary quantum communication protocols, more advanced quantum computation and simulation tasks as well as quantum-enhanced measurements require many-body entanglement. Over the past years, impressive progress has been made on entangling larger numbers of qubits using unitary quantum gates. Entangled states are, however, sensitive to interactions with the environment, which are present in any open system. In particular decoherence and dissipation have remained a challenge. Here we show that by taking an approach alternative to quantum gates one can actively use dissipation to generate many-body entanglement. We demonstrate that by adding sources of dissipation and engineering decay processes, multi-particle entangled states can be prepared efficiently as steady states of the dissipative time evolution. Our protocols pave the way for the dissipative production of many-body entanglement in physical systems such as trapped ions.

abstract: We have found the algebraic structure of the two-qubit quantum Rabi model behind the possibility of its novel quasi-exact solutions with finite photon numbers by analyzing the Hamiltonian in the photon number space. The quasi-exact eigenstates with at most $1$ photon exist in the whole qubit-photon coupling regime with constant eigenenergy equal to single photon energy \hbar\omega, which can be clear demonstrated from the Hamiltonian structure. With similar method, we find these special "dark states"-like eigenstates commonly exist for the two-qubit Jaynes-Cummings model, with $E=N\hbar\omega$ (N=-1,0,1,...), and one of them is also the eigenstate of the two-qubit quantum Rabi model, which may provide some interesting application in a simper way. Besides, using Bogoliubov operators, we analytically retrieve the solution of the general two-qubit quantum Rabi model. In this more concise and physical way, without using Bargmann space, we clearly see how the eigenvalues of the infinite-dimensional two-qubit quantum Rabi Hamiltonian are determined by convergent power series, so that the solution can reach arbitrary accuracy reasonably because of the convergence property.

This approach allows to extend the random matrix theory to the newly discovered exceptional polynomials.

abstract: We compute R\'{e}nyi entropies for the statistics of a noisy simultaneous observation of two complementary observables in two-dimensional quantum systems. We find paradoxical results such as that the relative amount of uncertainty between two states depends on the uncertainty measure used, as well as unexpected relations between the entropy of the joint distribution and the product of its marginals for the same state. These results are not reproduced by a more standard duality relation. We show that the striking behaviors coincide with a lack of majorization relation between the corresponding statistics.

authors: Chun-Fang Li
comments: 32 pages
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06672
abstract: Different from the usual conclusion that the separation of the photon angular momentum into orbital and spin parts is physically meaningless, the orbital and spin angular momenta are demonstrated in the first-quantization framework not to satisfy the standard commutation relation. It is shown on the basis of the transversality condition that the spin is aligned with the propagation direction so that only the helicity can be the intrinsic degree of freedom. It is also shown on the same basis that only in the so-called intrinsic reference system does the helicity behave intrinsic. The intrinsic reference system of the photon is determined by the "action" of a gauge potential, the Berry potential, on the helicity of the photon. The Berry potential is fixed by a vector-valued degree of freedom, called the Berry degree of freedom. Because only the position of the photon in its intrinsic reference system is canonically conjugate to the momentum, the intrinsic reference system itself is endowed with quantum effects that depend on the Berry degree of freedom as well as the helicity. This not only explains the so-called spin Hall effect of light but also helps to understand why the total angular momentum cannot be generally split into helicity-independent orbital and helicity-dependent spin parts.

abstract: We obtained a simple theoretical unified parameter for the characterization of rotational population propagation of diatomic molecules in a periodic train of resonant optical pulses. The parameter comprises the peak intensity and interval between the pulses, and the level energies of the initial and final rotational states of the molecule. Using the unified parameter, we can predict the upper and lower boundaries of probability localization on the rotational level network, including the effect of centrifugal distortion. The unified parameter was tentatively derived from an analytical expression obtained by performing rotating-wave approximation and spectral decomposition of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation under an assumption of time-order invariance. The validity of the parameter was confirmed by comparison with numerical simulations for isotope-selective rotational excitation of KCl molecules.

abstract: Diffraction of light sets the fundamental limit for optical lithography. Many quantum lithography schemes have so far been proposed to overcome this limit either by making use of highly entangled photons, multi-photon processes or multiple Lambda transitions, which are all experimentally high-demanding. Recently, Liao et al. proposed a novel quantum lithography scheme which merely employs Rabi oscillation to surpass the diffraction limit. Here we report a faithful experimental realization of this scheme. Resolution up to ninth of the Rayleigh diffraction limit has been observed. Possibility of creating an arbitrary pattern is also tested experimentally by demonstrating the peak narrowing process using several Rabi floppings together with state-selective optical depletion. Our work may have direct applications in atom pattern engineering for quantum information or quantum simulation applications, and will also possibly boost the adoption of quantum lithography into real-world applications in the near future.

abstract: Although a number of measures for quantum non-Markovianity have been proposed recently, it is still an open question whether these measures directly characterize the memory effect of the environment, i.e., the dependence of a quantum state on its past in a time evolution. In this paper, we present a criterion and propose a measure for non-Markovianity with clear physical interpretations of the memory effect. The non-Markovianity is defined by the inequality $T(t_2,t_0)\neq T(t_2,t_1)T(t_1,t_0)$ in terms of memoryless dynamical map $T$ introduced in this paper. This definition is conceptually distinct from that based on divisibility used by Rivas et al (Phys. Rev. Lett 105, 050403 (2010)), whose violation is manifested by non-complete positivity of the dynamical map. We demonstrate via a typical quantum process that without Markovian approximation, nonzero memory effects (non-Markovianity) always exist even if the non-Markovianity is zero by the other non-Marovianity measures.

abstract: Coherent manipulation of single-photon wave packets is essentially important for optical quantum communication and quantum information processing. In this paper, we realize controllable splitting and modulation of single-photon-level pulses by using a tripod-type atomic medium. The adoption of two control beams enable us to store one signal pulse into superposition of two distinct atomic collective excitations. By controlling the time delay between the two control pulses, we observe splitting of a stored wave packet into two temporally-distinct modes. By controlling the frequency detuning of the control beams, we observe both temporal and frequency-domain interference of the retrieval signal pulses, which provides a method for pulse modulation and multi-splitting of the signal photons.

abstract: A long-standing question is whether it is possible to delegate computational tasks securely. Recently, both a classical and a quantum solution to this problem were found. Here, we study the interplay of classical and quantum approaches and show how coherence can be used as a tool for secure delegated classical computation. We show that a client with limited computational capacity - restricted to an XOR gate - can perform universal classical computation by manipulating information carriers that may occupy superpositions of two states. Using single photonic qubits or coherent light, we experimentally implement secure delegated classical computations between an independent client and a server. The server has access to the light sources and measurement devices, whereas the client may use only a restricted set of passive optical devices to manipulate the light beams. Thus, our work highlights how minimal quantum and classical resources can be combined and exploited for classical computing.

abstract: The Navier-Stokes equation contains two terms which have been subjected to slight modification: (a) the viscosity term depends of time (the viscosity in average on time is zero, but its variance is non-zero); (b) the pressure gradient contains an added term describing the quantum entropy gradient multiplied by the pressure. Owing to these modifications, the Navier-Stokes equation can be reduced to the Schr\"odinger equation describing behavior of a particle into the vacuum being as a superfluid medium. Vortex structures arising in this medium show infinitely long life owing to zeroth average viscosity. The non-zero variance describes exchange of the vortex energy with zero-point energy of the vacuum. Radius of the vortex trembles around some average value. This observation sheds the light to the Zitterbewegung phenomenon. The long-lived vortex has a non-zero core where the vortex velocity vanishes.

abstract: We study spectral singularities and their application in determining the threshold gain coefficient $g^{(E/M)}$ for oblique transverse electric/magnetic (TE/TM) modes of an infinite planar slab of homogenous optically active material. We show that $g^{(E)}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the incidence angle $\theta$ (measured with respect to the normal direction to the slab), while $g^{(M)}$ has a single maximum, $\theta_c$, where it takes an extremely large value. We identify $\theta_c$ with the Brewster's angle and show that $g^{(E)}$ and $g^{(M)}$ coincide for $\theta=0$ (normal incidence), tend to zero as $\theta\to 90^\circ$, and satisfy $g^{(E)}<g^{(M)}$ for $0<\theta<90^\circ$. We therefore conclude that lasing and coherent perfect absorption are always more difficult to achieve for the oblique TM waves and that they are virtually impossible for the TM waves with $\theta\approx\theta_c$. We also give a detailed description of the behavior of the energy density and the Poynting vector for spectrally singular oblique TE and TM waves. This provides an explicit demonstration of the parity-invariance of these waves and shows that the energy density of a spectrally singular TM wave with $\theta>\theta_c$ is smaller inside the gain region than outside it. The converse is true for the TM waves with $\theta<\theta_c$ and all TE waves.

abstract: We present a new variational method, based on the matrix product operator (MPO) ansatz, for finding the steady state of dissipative quantum chains governed by master equations of the Lindblad form. Instead of requiring an accurate representation of the system evolution until the stationary state is attained, the algorithm directly targets the final state, thus allowing for a faster convergence when the steady state is a MPO with small bond dimension. Our numerical simulations for several dissipative spin models over a wide range of parameters illustrate the performance of the method and show that indeed the stationary state is often well described by a MPO of very moderate dimensions.

This experiment is accomplished in single photon level and exhibits strong universality in quantum computation.

abstract: Quantum discord expresses a fundamental non-classicality of correlations more general than quantum entanglement. We combine the no-local-broadcasting theorem, semidefinite-programming characterizations of quantum fidelity and quantum separability, and a recent breakthrough result of Fawzi and Renner about quantum Markov chains to provide a hierarchy of computationally efficient lower bounds to quantum discord. Such a hierarchy converges to the surprisal of measurement recoverability introduced by Seshadreesan and Wilde, and provides a faithful lower bound to quantum discord already at the lowest non-trivial level. Furthermore, the latter constitutes by itself a valid discord-like measure of the quantumness of correlations.

In this paper we present analytical solutions for computing quantum discord of the most general class of X-states and the criteria for each analytical solution to be valid. We discuss parameter regions that correspond to different analytical solutions and explain the underlying reasons for such structure to exist. We apply our formalism to study both arbitrary X-states and X-states with certain symmetries. We find that our analytical formalism is in excellent agreement with numerical calculation of quantum discord in both cases.

abstract: Every quantum operation can be decomposed into a sequence of single-qubit and Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gates. In many implementations, single-qubit gates are simpler to perform than C-NOTs, and it is hence desirable to minimize the number of C-NOT gates required to implement a circuit. Previous work has looked at C-NOT-efficient synthesis of arbitrary unitaries and state preparation. Here we consider the generalization to arbitrary isometries from m qubits to n qubits. We derive a theoretical lower bound on the number of C-NOT gates required to decompose an isometry for arbitrary m and n, and give an explicit gate decomposition that achieves this bound up to a factor of about two in the leading order. We also perform some bespoke optimizations in the case of small m and n. In addition, we show how to apply our result for isometries to give a decomposition scheme for an arbitrary quantum operation via Stinespring's theorem, and derive a lower bound on the number of C-NOTs in this case too.

abstract: Thermodynamic entropy, as defined by Clausius, characterizes macroscopic observations of a system based on phenomenological quantities such as temperature and heat. In contrast, information-theoretic entropy, introduced by Shannon, is a measure of uncertainty. In this Letter, we connect these two notions of entropy, using an axiomatic framework for thermodynamics [Lieb, Yngvason, Proc. Roy. Soc.(2013)]. In particular, we obtain a direct relation between the Clausius entropy and the Shannon entropy, or its generalisation to quantum systems, the von Neumann entropy. More generally, we find that entropy measures relevant in non-equilibrium thermodynamics correspond to entropies used in one-shot information theory.

abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a previously published realization of Popper's experiment using entangled ghost imaging. Our analysis, which is based on optical diffraction integrals, shows that, for the configuration previously described, the transverse spread of an unmeasured particle (the signal photon here) does not increase in inverse proportion to the width of its virtual confinement when its entangled twin is confined in transverse dimension by a physical slit. Rather we show that the spread of the unmeasured particle carries no dependence on the width of its virtual confinement in the published configuration. Instead, it spreads geometrically at a rate determined by the numerical aperture of the ghost imaging system. We further propose an alternative configuration for which the spread of the unmeasured particle does increase in inverse proportion to the width of its virtual confinement. We discuss the relation of these results to the predictions of Popper.

abstract: Quantum walks can be defined in two quite distinct ways: discrete-time and continuous-time quantum walks (DTQWs and CTQWs). For classical random walks, there is a natural sense in which continuous-time walks are a limit of discrete-time walks. Quantum mechanically, in the discrete-time case, an additional "coin space" must be appended for the walk to have nontrivial time evolution. Continuous-time quantum walks, however, have no such constraints. This means that there is no completely straightforward way to treat a CTQW as a limit of DTQW, as can be done in the classical case. Various approaches to this problem have been taken in the past. We give a construction for walks on $d$-regular, $d$-colorable graphs when the coin flip operator is Hermitian: from a standard DTQW we construct a family of discrete-time walks with a well-defined continuous-time limit on a related graph. One can think of this limit as a {\it coined} continuous-time walk. We show that these CTQWs share some properties with coined DTQWs. In particular, we look at spatial search by a DTQW over the 2-D torus (a grid with periodic boundary conditions) of size $\sqrt{N}\times\sqrt{N}$, where it was shown \nocite{AAmbainis08} that a coined DTQW can search in time $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$, but a standard CTQW \nocite{Childs2004} takes $\Omega(N)$ time to search for a marked element. The continuous limit of the DTQW search over the 2-D torus exhibits the $O(\sqrt{N}\log{N})$ scaling, like the coined walk it is derived from. We also look at the effects of graph symmetry on the limiting walk, and show that the properties are similar to those of the DTQW as shown in \cite{HariKrovi2007}.

abstract: Cold molecular ions are promising candidates in various fields ranging from precision spectroscopy and test of fundamental physics to ultra-cold chemistry. Control of internal and external degrees of freedom is a prerequisite for many of these applications. Motional ground state cooling represents the starting point for quantum logic-assisted internal state preparation, detection, and spectroscopy protocols. Robust and fast cooling is crucial to maximize the fraction of time available for the actual experiment. We optimize the cooling rate of ground state cooling schemes for single $^{25}\mathrm{Mg}^{+}$ ions and sympathetic ground state cooling of $^{24}\mathrm{MgH}^{+}$. In particular, we show that robust cooling is achieved by combining pulsed Raman sideband cooling with continuous quench cooling. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate an efficient strategy for ground state cooling outside the Lamb-Dicke regime.

abstract: I investigate quantum decoherence in a one-body density matrix of a composite particle consisting of two correlated particles. Because of a two-body correlation in the composite particle, quantum decoherence occurs in the one-body density matrix that has been reduced from the two-body density matrix. As the delocalization of the distribution of the composite particle grows, the entanglement entropy increases, and the system can be well-described by a semi-classical approximation, wherein the center position of the composite particle can be regarded as a classical coordinate. I connect the quantum decoherence in the one-body density matrix of a composite particle to the coarse graining in a phase space distribution function of a single particle and associate it with the Husimi function.

abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking can enhance or suppress the probability of success for quantum state transfer (QST), and remarkably it can be used to implement the directional QST. In this paper we study the QST on a ring with time-reversal asymmetry. We show that the system will behave as a quantum state turnplate under some proper parameters, which may serve as time controlled quantum routers in complex quantum networks. We propose to to realize the quantum state turnplate in the coupled resonator optical waveguide by controlling the coupling strength and the phase.

abstract: For every N-qubit density matrix written in the computational basis, an associated "X-density matrix" can be obtained by vanishing all entries out of the main- and anti-diagonals. It is very simple to compute the genuine multipartite (GM) concurrence of this associated N-qubit X-state, which, moreover, lower bounds the GM-concurrence of the original (non-X) state. In this paper, we rely on these facts to introduce and benchmark a heuristic for estimating the GM-concurrence of an arbitrary multiqubit mixed state. By explicitly considering two classes of mixed states, we illustrate that our estimates are usually very close to the standard lower bound on the GM-concurrence, being significantly easier to compute. In addition, while evaluating the performance of our proposed heuristic, we provide the first characterization of GM-entanglement in the steady states of the driven Dicke model at zero temperature.

abstract: The Two-Body Dirac equations of constraint theory are of special interest not only in view of applications for phenomenological calculations of mesonic spectra but also because they avoid no-go theorems about relativistic interactions. Furthermore, they provide a quantum mechanical description in a manifestly Lorentz invariant way using the concept of a multi-time wave function. In this paper, we place them into the context of the multi-time formalism of Dirac, Tomonaga and Schwinger for the first time. A general physical and mathematical framework is outlined and the mechanism which permits relativistic interaction is identified. The main requirement derived from the general framework is the existence of conserved tensor currents with a positive component which can play the role of a probability density. We analyze this question for a general class of Two-Body Dirac equations thoroughly and comprehensively. While the free Dirac current is not conserved, it is possible to find replacements. Improving on previous research, we achieve definite conclusions whether restrictions of the function space or of the interaction terms can guarantee the positive definiteness of the currents -- and whether such restrictions are physically adequate. The consequences of the results are drawn, with respect to both applied and foundational perspectives.

abstract: A coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on a multiple-pulse degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) is evaluated for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The underlying mechanism of CIM originates from the bistable phase bifurcation at DOPO phase transition and the inherent preference of the coupled DOPOs in selecting an oscillation mode with the minimum photon decay rate. This paper presents the theoretical model and numerical simulation results of the proposed machine. Computational experiments are performed on NP-hard MAX-CUT problems with number of vertices up to $2 \times 10^4$ and number of edges up to $10^8$. The numerical simulation results suggest the substantial speed-up for obtaining the reasonably good solution of MAX-CUT problems on a CIM against traditional algorithms such as semidefinite programming of Goemans-Williamson and simulated annealing by Kirkpatrick, et al.

In order to have high-fidelity gate operations, we make use of stimulated Raman transition and controlled Lamor precession jointly. We characterize the gate performances with quantum state tomography and quantum process tomography, both of which imply that high-fidelity operations have been achieved. Our work complements the experimental toolbox of atomic-ensemble quantum memories by adding the capability of single-qubit manipulation, thus may have important applications in future scalable quantum networks.

For \emph{structured} search by continuous-time quantum walk, however, we show that rearranging the marked elements can cause the parameter(s) or runtime to vary such that, without prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of the marked elements, a potentially sub-exponential number of configurations would need to be tried, meaning it would be better to not run the search algorithm at all.

abstract: Time-dependent quantities are calculated in the linear response limit for a correlated one dimensional model atom driven by an external quadrupolar time-dependent field. Besides the analysis of the time-evolving energy change in the correlated two-particle system, and orthogonality of initial and final states, Mehler's formula is applied in order to derive a point-wise decomposition of the time-dependent one-matrix in terms of time-dependent occupation numbers and time-dependent orthonormal, natural orbitals. Based on such exact spectral decomposition on the time domain, R\'enyi's entropy is also investigated. Considering the structure of the exact time-dependent one-matrix, an independent-particle model is defined from it which contains exact information on the single-particle probability density and probability current. The resulting noninteracting auxiliary state is used to construct an effective potential and discuss its applicability.

journal:

abstract: It is a frequent assumption that - via superluminal information transfers - superluminal signals capable of enabling communication are necessarily exchanged in any quantum theory that posits hidden superluminal influences. However, does the presence of hidden superluminal influences automatically imply superluminal signalling and communication? The non-signalling theorem mediates the apparent conflict between quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity. However, as a 'no-go' theorem there exist two opposing interpretations of the non-signalling constraint: foundational and operational. Concerning Bell's theorem, we argue that Bell employed both interpretations at different times. Bell finally pursued an explicitly operational position on non-signalling which is often associated with ontological quantum theory, e.g., de Broglie-Bohm theory. This position we refer to as "effective non-signalling". By contrast, associated with orthodox quantum mechanics is the foundational position referred to here as "axiomatic non-signalling". In search of a decisive communication-theoretic criterion for differentiating between "axiomatic" and "effective" non-signalling, we employ the operational framework offered by Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. We find that an effective non-signalling theorem represents two sub-theorems, which we call (1) non-transfer-control (NTC) theorem, and (2) non-signification-control (NSC) theorem. Employing NTC and NSC theorems, we report that effective, instead of axiomatic, non-signalling is entirely sufficient for prohibiting nonlocal communication. An effective non-signalling theorem allows for nonlocal quantum information transfer yet - at the same time - effectively denies superluminal signalling and communication.

abstract: This paper presents the geometric setting of quantum variational principles and extends it to comprise the interaction between classical and quantum degrees of freedom. Euler-Poincar\'e reduction theory is applied to the Schr\"odinger, Heisenberg and Wigner-Moyal dynamics of pure states. This construction leads to new variational principles for the description of mixed quantum states. The corresponding momentum map properties are presented as they arise from the underlying unitary symmetries. Finally, certain semidirect-product group structures are shown to produce new variational principles for Dirac's interaction picture and the equations of hybrid classical-quantum dynamics.

abstract: Quantum physics allows us to certify the security of a communication line against an eavesdropper with unbounded computational power. The achievable rates of quantum secured communication are also limited by the laws of quantum physics and in particular by the properties of entanglement. For the most relevant case of a lossy communication line, this implies that the secret key generation rate vanishes at least exponentially with the distance. In this letter we show that this fundamental limitation can be violated by a constant amount if one seeks secrecy against an eavesdropper still endowed with unlimited computational power but capable of storing quantum information only for a limited time. Under this relaxed but still concrete security assumption, we show that the phenomenon of quantum data locking can be harnessed to bootstrap a `locked' key at a rate as high as the eavesdropper's quantum discord. For the case of the lossy bononic channel, this yields a constant locked key generation rate of one bit per mode over arbitrarily long communication distances.

abstract: The most elementary quantum walk is characterized by a 2-dimensional unitary coin flip matrix, which can be parameterized by 4 real variables. The influence of the choice of the coin flip matrix on the time evolution operator is analysed in a systematic way. By changing the coin parameters, the dispersion and asymmetry of eigenvalues of the time evolution operator can be tuned in a controlled way. The reduced eigenvectors in coin space are distributed along trajectories on the surface or inside the Bloch sphere, depending on the degeneracy of the spectrum. At certain values of the coin parameters the spectrum of the time evolution operator becomes 2-fold degenerate, but there might exist unique eigenvalues at the top and bottom of each quasi-energy band. The eigenstates corresponding to such eigenvalues are robust against arbitrary temporal variations in the bias parameter of the coin, as long as rest of the parameters remain unchanged.

abstract: We assess the overall performance of our quantum key distribution (QKD) system implementing the measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocol using components with varying capabilities such as different single photon detectors and qubit preparation hardware. We experimentally show that superconducting nanowire single photon detectors allow QKD over a channel featuring 60 dB loss, and QKD with more than 600 bits of secret key per second (not considering finite key effects) over a 16 dB loss channel. This corresponds to 300 km and 80 km of standard telecommunication fiber, respectively. We also demonstrate that the integration of our QKD system into FPGA-based hardware (instead of state-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators) does not impact on its performance. Our investigation allows us to acquire an improved understanding of the trade-offs between complexity, cost and system performance, which is required for future customization of MDI-QKD. Given that our system can be operated outside the laboratory over deployed fiber, we conclude that MDI-QKD is a promising approach to information-theoretic secure key distribution.

abstract: The non-Markovianity is a prominent concept of the dynamics of the open quantum systems, which is of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics and quantum information. Despite of lots of efforts, the experimentally measuring of non-Markovianity of an open system is still limited to very small systems. Presently, it is still impossible to experimentally quantify the non-Markovianity of high dimension systems with the widely used Breuer-Laine-Piilo (BLP) trace distance measure. In this paper, we propose a method, combining experimental measurements and numerical calculations, that allow quantifying the non-Markovianity of a $N$ dimension system only scaled as $N^2$, successfully avoid the exponential scaling with the dimension of the open system in the current method. After the benchmark with a two-dimension open system, we demonstrate the method in quantifying the non-Markovanity of a high dimension open quantum random walk system.

abstract: This essay advocates the view that any problem that has a meaningful empirical content, can be formulated in constructive, more definitely, finite terms. We consider combinatorial models of dynamical systems and approaches to statistical description of such models. We demonstrate that many concepts of continuous physics --- such as continuous symmetries, the principle of least action, Lagrangians, deterministic evolution equations --- can be obtained from combinatorial structures as a result of the large number approximation. We propose a constructive description of quantum behavior that provides, in particular, a natural explanation of appearance of complex numbers in the formalism of quantum mechanics. Some approaches to construction of discrete models of quantum evolution that involve gauge connections are discussed.

abstract: We study optimal control strategies to optimize the relaxation rate towards the fixed point of a quantum system in the presence of a non-Markovian dissipative bath. Contrary to naive expectations that suggest that memory effects might be exploited to improve optimal control effectiveness, non-Markovian effects influence the optimal strategy in a non trivial way: we present a necessary condition to be satisfied so that the effectiveness of optimal control is enhanced by non-Markovianity subject to suitable unitary controls. For illustration, we specialize our findings for the case of the dynamics of single qubit amplitude damping channels. The optimal control strategy presented here can be used to implement optimal cooling processes in quantum technologies and may have implications in quantum thermodynamics when assessing the efficiency of thermal micro-machines.

In the extended Temperley-Lieb diagrammatical approach, we clearly show that such topological features bring about the fault-tolerant construction of both universal quantum gates and four-partite entangled states more intuitive and simpler. Furthermore, we describe the Yang--Baxter gate by its extended Temperley-Lieb configuration, and then study teleportation-based quantum circuit models using the Yang--Baxter gate. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between the extended Temperley-Lieb diagrammatical approach and the Yang-Baxter gate approach. With these research results, we propose a worthwhile subject, the extended Temperley-Lieb diagrammatical approach, for physicists in quantum information and quantum computation.

abstract: We study in detail a system of two interferometers aimed to the detection of extremely faint phase-fluctuations. This system can represent a breakthrough for detecting a faint correlated signal that would remain otherwise undetectable even using the most sensitive individual interferometric devices, that are limited by the shot noise. If the two interferometers experience identical phase-fluctuations, like the ones introduced by the so called "holographic noise", this signal should emerge if their output signals are correlated, while the fluctuations due to shot noise and other independent contributions will vanish. We show how the injecting quantum light in the free ports of the interferometers can reduce the photon noise of the system beyond the shot-noise, enhancing the resolution in the phase-correlation estimation. We analyze both the use of two-mode squeezed vacuum or twin-beam state (TWB) and of two independent squeezing states. Our results basically confirms the benefit of using squeezed beams together with strong coherent beams in interferometry, even in this correlated case. However, mainly we concentrate on the possible use of TWB, discovering interesting and probably unexplored areas of application of bipartite entanglement and in particular the possibility of reaching in principle surprising uncertainty reduction.

title: Necessary and sufficient conditions for macroscopic realism from quantum mechanics

abstract: Macroscopic realism, the classical world view that macroscopic objects exist independently of and are not influenced by measurements, is usually tested using Leggett-Garg inequalities. Recently, another necessary condition called no-signaling in time (NSIT) has been proposed as a witness for non-classical behavior. In this paper, we show that a combination of NSIT conditions is not only necessary but also sufficient for a macrorealistic description of a physical system. Any violation of macroscopic realism must therefore be witnessed by a suitable NSIT condition. Subsequently, we derive an operational formulation for NSIT in terms of positive-operator valued measurements and the system Hamiltonian. We argue that this leads to a suitable definition of "classical" measurements and Hamiltonians, and apply our formalism to some generic coarse-grained quantum measurements.

abstract: We describe a protocol for quantum information splitting (QIS) of a restricted class of three-qubit states among three parties Alice, Bob and Charlie, using a pair of GHZ states as the quantum channel. There are two different forms of this three-qubit state that is used for QIS depending on the distribution of the particles among the three parties. There is also a special type of four-qubit state that can be used for QIS using the above channel. We explicitly construct the quantum channel, Alice's measurement basis and the analytic form of the unitary operations required by the receiver for such a purpose.

abstract: The recent observation of the dynamical Casimir effect in a modulated superconducting waveguide, coronating thirty years of world-wide research, empowered the quantum technology community with a powerful tool to create entangled photons on-chip. In this work we show how, going beyond the single waveguide paradigm using a scalable array, it is possible to create multipartite nonclassical states, with the possibility to control the long-range quantum correlations of the emitted photons. In particular, our finite-temperature theory shows how maximally entangled $NOON$ states can be engineered in a realistic setup. The results here presented open the way to new kinds of quantum fluids of light, arising from modulated vacuum fluctuations in linear systems.

abstract: Quantum walks have been very successful in the development of search algorithms in quantum information, in particular in the development of spatial search algorithms. However, the construction of continuous-time quantum search algorithms in two-dimensional lattices has proved difficult, requiring additional degrees of freedom. Here, we demonstrate that continuous-time quantum walk search is possible in two-dimensions by changing the search topology to a graphene lattice, utilising the Dirac point in the energy spectrum. This is made possible by making a change to standard methods of marking a particular site in the lattice. Various ways of marking a site are shown to result in successful search protocols. We further establish that the search can be adapted to transfer probability amplitude across the lattice between specific lattice sites thus establishing a line of communication between these sites.

abstract: We demonstrate active control of inhomogeneous dephasing and rephasing for single collective atomic spin excitations (spin-waves) created by spontaneous Raman scattering in a quantum memory based on cold $^{87}$Rb atoms. The control is provided by a reversible external magnetic field gradient inducing an inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic hyperfine levels. We demonstrate experimentally that active rephasing preserves the single photon nature of the retrieved photons. Finally, we show that the control of the inhomogeneous dephasing enables the creation of time-separated spin-waves in a single ensemble, followed by a selective readout in time. This is an important step towards the implementation of a functional temporally multiplexed quantum repeater node.

abstract: We demonstrate that the spin-2 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state on the square lattice is a universal resource for the measurement-based quantum computation. Our proof is done by locally converting the AKLT to two-dimensional random planar graph states and by certifying that with high probability the resulting random graphs are in the supercritical phase of percolation using Monte Carlo simulations. One key enabling point is the exact weight formula that we derive for arbitrary measurement outcomes according to a spin-2 POVM on all spins. We also argue that the spin-2 AKLT state on the three-dimensional diamond lattice is a universal resource, the advantage of which would be the possibility of implementing fault-tolerant quantum computation with topological protection. In addition, as we deform the AKLT Hamiltonian, there is a finite region that the ground state can still support a universal resource before making a transition in its quantum computational power.

abstract: The conflict between the determinism of geometry in general relativity and the essential statistics of quantum mechanics blocks the development of a unified theory. Electromagnetic radiation is essential to both fields and supplies a common meeting ground. It is proposed that a suitable mechanism to resolve these differences can be based on the use of a time-symmetric treatment for the radiation. Advanced fields of the absorber can be interpreted to supply the random character of spontaneous emission. This allows the statistics of the Born rule to come from the spontaneous emission that occurs during a physical measurement. When the absorber is included, quantum mechanics is completely deterministic. It is suggested that the peculiar properties of kaons may be induced by the advanced effects of the neutrino field. Schr\"odinger's cat loses its enigmatic personality and the identification of mental processes as an essential component of a measurement is no longer needed.

abstract: We study the phase transition from two different topological phases to the ferromagnetic phase by focusing on points of the phase transition. To this end, we present a detailed mapping from such models to the Ising model in a transverse field. Such a mapping is derived by re-writing the initial Hamiltonian in a new basis so that the final model in such a basis has a well-known approximated phase transition point. Specifically, we consider the toric codes and the color codes on some various lattices with Ising perturbation. Our results provide a useful table to compare the robustness of the topological codes and to explicitly show that the robustness of the topological codes depends on triangulation of their underlying lattices.

The reduction in space compared to an amplitude formalism approach is significant, allowing simulations as large as 42 qubits to be run on a single processor with 32GB RAM. This approach is readily adapted to a distributed memory environment, and we have simulated a 45 qubit case using 8 cores with 16GB RAM in approximately one hour.

abstract: Simulating quantum physics with a device which itself is quantum mechanical, a notion Richard Feynman originated, would be an unparallelled computational resource. However, the universal quantum simulation of fermionic systems is daunting due to their particle statistics, and Feynman left as an open question whether it could be done, because of the need for non-local control. Here, we implement fermionic interactions with digital techniques in a superconducting circuit. Focusing on the Hubbard model, we perform time evolution with constant interactions as well as a dynamic phase transition with up to four fermionic modes encoded in four qubits. The implemented digital approach is universal and allows for the efficient simulation of fermions in arbitrary spatial dimensions. We use in excess of 300 single-qubit and two-qubit gates, and reach global fidelities which are limited by gate errors. This demonstration highlights the feasibility of the digital approach and opens a viable route towards analog-digital quantum simulation of interacting fermions and bosons in large-scale solid state systems.

abstract: During the long course of evolution, nature has learnt how to exploit quantum effects. In fact, recent experiments reveal the existence of quantum processes whose coherence extends over unexpectedly long time and space ranges. In particular, photosynthetic processes in light-harvesting complexes display a typical oscillatory dynamics ascribed to quantum coherence. Here, we consider the simple model where a dimer made of two chromophores is strongly coupled with a quasi-resonant vibrational mode. We observe the occurrence of wide oscillations of genuine quantum correlations, between electronic excitations and the environment, represented by vibrational bosonic modes. Such a quantum dynamics has been unveiled through the calculation of the negativity of entanglement and the discord, indicators widely used in quantum information for quantifying the resources needed to realize quantum technologies. We also discuss the possibility of approximating additional weakly-coupled off-resonant vibrational modes, simulating the disturbances induced by the rest of the environment, by a single vibrational mode. Within this approximation, one can show that the off-resonant bath behaves like a classical source of noise.

Unlike the standard method to change the interaction strength with unitary operations, we fully make use of non-unitary properties of projective measurements so that we can effectively turn on/off the interaction via feedforward. We then show how to generate a two or three-dimensional cluster state that are universal resource for fault tolerant quantum computation with this scheme. Our scheme provides an alternative way to realize a scalable quantum processor.

abstract: We study the spin transport in the quantum Heisenberg spin chain subject to boundary magnetic fields and driven out of equilibrium by Lindblad dissipators. An exact solution is given in terms of matrix product states, which allows us to calculate exactly the spin current for any chain size. It is found that the system undergoes a discontinuous spin-valve-like quantum phase transition from ballistic to sub-diffusive spin current, depending on the value of the boundary fields. Thus, the chain behaves as an extremely sensitive magnonic logic gate operating with the boundary fields as the base element.

Existing schemes rely on inducting couplings to realize Ising interactions between flux qubits, and the interaction strength is controlled by an applied magnetic field On the other hand, we have found a way to generate an interaction between the flux qubits via capacitive couplings. This has an advantage in individual addressability, because we can control the interaction strength by changing an applied voltage that can be easily localized. This is a crucial step toward the realizing superconducting flux qubit quantum computation.

abstract: The fidelity and local unitary transformation are two widely useful notions in quantum physics. We study two constrained optimization problems in terms of the maximal and minimal fidelity between two bipartite quantum states undergoing local unitary dynamics. The problems are related to the geometric measure of entanglement and the distillability problem. We show that the problems can be reduced to semi-definite programming optimization problems. We give close-form formulae of the fidelity when the two states are both pure states, or a pure product state and the Werner state. We explain from the point of view of local unitary actions that why the entanglement in Werner states is hard to accessible. For general mixed states, we give upper and lower bounds of the fidelity using tools such as affine fidelity, channels and relative entropy from information theory. We also investigate the power of local unitaries and quantification for the commutativity of quantum states, and the equivalence of the two optimization problems.

abstract: We discuss the use of a class of exact finite energy solutions to the vacuum source free Maxwell equations as models for multi- and single cycle laser pulses in classical interaction with relativistic charged point particles. These solutions are classified in terms of their chiral content and their influence on particular charge configurations in space. The results of such classical interactions motivate a particular quantum description of a freely propagating laser pulse in terms of an effective quantum Hamiltonian. The classical chiral states that evolve according to the classical vacuum Maxwell equations are now replaced by quantized bi-qutrit elements satisfying the Schrodinger equation. This description may offer a means to control and manipulate qu-trit states encoded into such laser pulses.

abstract: We discuss modern developments in quantum optics with organic molecules, clusters and nanoparticles -- in particular recent realizations of near-field matter-wave interferometry. A unified theoretical description in phase space allows us to describe quantum interferometry in position space and in the time domain on an equal footing. In order to establish matter-wave interferometers as a universal tool, which can accept and address a variety of nanoparticles, we elaborate on new quantum optical elements, such as diffraction gratings made of matter and light, as well as their absorptive and dispersive interaction with complex materials. We present Talbot-Lau interferometry (TLI), the Kapitza-Dirac-Talbot-Lau interferometer (KDTLI) and interferometry with pulsed optical gratings (OTIMA) as the most advanced devices to study the quantum wave nature of composite matter. These experiments define the current mass and complexity record in interferometric explorations of quantum macroscopicity and they open new avenues to quantum assisted metrology with applications in physical chemistry and biomolecular physics.

The resulting family of codes, which we call `matching codes' realize the same anyon model as the surface codes, and so may be similarly used in proposals for quantum computation. We show that these codes are particularly well suited to engineering twist defects that behave as Majorana modes. A proof of principle system that demonstrates the braiding properties of the Majoranas is discussed that requires only three qubits.

abstract: In this work, we study the quantum entanglement for doubly excited resonance states in helium by using highly correlated Hylleraas type functions to represent such states of the two-electron system. The doubly-excited resonance states are determined by calculation of density of resonance states under the framework of the stabilization method. The spatial (electron-electron orbital) entanglement measures for the low-lying doubly excited 2s2, 2s3s, and 2p2 1Se states are carried out. Once a resonance state wave function is obtained, the linear entropy and von Neumann entropy for such a state are quantified using the Schmidt-Slater decomposition method. To check the consistence, linear entropy is also determined by solving analytically the needed four-electron (12-dimensional) integrals.

abstract: In the dissipative quantum dynamics of a mesoscopic aggregate of excited two level systems (atoms) coupled to a single resonance mode of a cavity, two physical phenomena associated with superradiance appear. A pronounced emission peak on short time scales is related to the known superradiant burst of excited atoms cooperatively radiating into free space. It is followed by relaxation to a stationary state of the composite system such that for sufficiently large atom-field coupling a strongly correlated state emerges. The crossover to this state can be interpreted as the precursor of the transition from normal to superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit of the Dicke Hamiltonian. Motivated by recent experimental activities, these features are investigated in detail for a mesoscopic number of atoms and a cavity embedded in a dissipative medium described by a damped Dicke model. We identify observables and characteristics of the quantum dynamics on shorter time scales which allow to clearly distinguish weakly correlated from strongly correlated Dicke physics.

abstract: We study the coupled even number of microcavities with the balanced gain and loss between any pair of their neighboring components. The effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for such structure has the cyclic permutation-time symmetry with respect to the cavity modes, and this symmetry determines the patterns of the dynamical evolutions of the cavity modes. The systems also have multiple exceptional points for the degeneracy of the existing supermodes, exhibiting the "phase transition" of system dynamics across these exceptional points. We illustrate the quantum dynamical properties of the systems with the evolutions of cavity photon numbers and correlation functions. Moreover, we demonstrate the effects of the quantum noises accompanying the amplification and dissipation of the cavity modes. The reciprocal light transportation predicted with the effective non-Hermitian models for the similar couplers is violated by the unavoidable quantum noises.

Following [15, 16], where the definition of Fisher information tensor is introduced, we will show how its antisymmetric part is the pullback of the natural Kostant-Kirillov-Souriau symplectic form along some natural difeomorphism. In order to do this we will need to understand the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) as a proper 1-form, settling the issues about its very definition and explicit computation. Moreover, the fibration of co-adjoint orbits, seen as spaces of mixed states, is also discussed.

abstract: We study the Maslov correction to semiclassical states by using a K\"ahler regularized BKS pairing map from the energy representation to the Schr\"odinger representation. For general semiclassical states, the existence of this regularization is based on recently found families of K\"ahler polarizations degenerating to singular real polarizations and corresponding to special geodesic rays in the space of K\"ahler metrics. In the case of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, we show that the correct phases associated with caustic points of the projection of the Lagrangian curves to the configuration space are correctly reproduced.

abstract: We present an implementation of a continuous matrix product state for two-component fermions in one-dimension. We propose a construction of variational matrices with an efficient parameterization that respects the translational symmetry of the problem (without being overly constraining) and readily meets the regularity conditions that arise from removing the ultraviolet divergences in the kinetic energy. We test the validity of our approach on an interacting spin-1/2 system and observe that the ansatz correctly predicts the ground state magnetic properties for the attractive spin-1/2 Fermi gas, including the phase-oscillating pair correlation function in the partially polarized regime.

abstract: Quantization of multiply-connected spaces requires tools which take these spaces' global properties into account. Applying these tools exposes additional degrees of freedom. This was first realized in the Aharonov-Bohm effect, where this additional degree of freedom was a magnetic flux confined to a solenoid, which an electron cannot enter. Previous work using Feynman path integrals has either only dealt with specific cases, or was limited to spaces with finite fundamental groups, and therefore, was in fact inapplicable to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, as well as to interesting systems such as anyons. In this paper we start from the fundamental groupoid. This less familiar algebraic-topological object is oriented towards general paths. This makes it a more natural choice for the path integral approach than the more commonly known fundamental group, which is restricted to loops. Using this object, we provide a method that works for spaces with infinite fundamental groups. We adapt a tool used in the previous, restricted result, in order to clearly delineate physically significant degrees of freedom from gauge freedom. This allows us to explicitly build phases which take account of symmetries of the space, directly from topological considerations; we end by providing a pertinent example relating to anyons.

abstract: We define a new concept of local states in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT). Local states are a natural generalization of states and give a clear vision of localization in the context of QFT. In terms of them, we can find a condition from which follows automatically the famous DHR selection criterion in DHR-DR theory. As a result, we can understand the condition as consequences of physically natural state preparations in vacuum backgrounds. Furthermore, a theory of orthogonal decomposition of completely positive (CP) maps is developed. It unifies a theory of orthogonal decomposition of states and order structure theory of CP maps. By using it, localized version of sectors is formulated, which gives sector theory for local states with respect to general reference representations.

abstract: In this paper, we aim at establishing measurement theory in local quantum physics. For this purpose, we discuss a representation theory of completely positive (CP) instruments. We introduce a condition called the normal extension property (NEP) and establish a one-to-one correspondence between CP instruments with NEP and statistical equivalence classes of measuring processes. We further explore a class of CP instruments having measuring processes approximately by the notion of injectivity of von Neumann algebras. The existence problem of a family of a posteriori states is discussed and it is shown that NEP is equivalent to the existence of a strongly measurable family of a posteriori states for every normal state. Moreover, two examples of CP instruments without NEP are given. To conclude the paper, local measurements in algebraic quantum field theory are developed.

abstract: An efficient technique to produce a periodic sequence of ultrashort pulses of recoilless gamma-radiation via its transmission through the optically thick vibrating resonant absorber was demonstrated recently [Nature, 508, 80 (2014)]. In this work we extend the theoretical analysis to the case of a set of multiple absorbers. We consider an analytical model describing the control of spectral content of a frequency modulated gamma-radiation by selective correction of amplitudes and initial phases of some spectral components, using, respectively, the resonant absorption or dispersion of nuclei. On the basis of the analytical solutions we determine the ultimate possibilities of the proposed technique.

abstract: Periodic driving can create topological phases of matter absent in static systems. In terms of the displacement of the position expectation value of a time-evolving wavepacket in a closed system, a type of adiabatic dynamics in periodically driven systems is studied for general initial states possessing coherence between different Floquet bands. Under one symmetry assumption, the displacement of the wavepacket center over one adiabatic cycle is found to be comprised by two components independent of the time scale of the adiabatic cycle: a weighted integral of the Berry curvature summed over all Floquet bands, plus an interband coherence induced correction. The found correction is beyond a naive application of the quantum adiabatic theorem but survives in the adiabatic limit due to interband coherence. Our theoretical results are hence of general interest towards an improved understanding of the quantum adiabatic theorem. Our theory is checked using a periodically driven superlattice model with nontrivial topological phases. In addition to probing topological phase transitions, the adiabatic dynamics studied in this work is now also anticipated to be useful in manifesting coherence and decoherence effects in the representation of Floquet bands.

abstract: Quantum sensors based on coherent matter-waves are precise measurement devices whose ultimate accuracy is achieved with Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in extended free fall. This is ideally realized in microgravity environments such as drop towers, ballistic rockets and space platforms. However, the transition from lab-based BEC machines to robust and mobile sources with comparable performance is a technological challenge. Here we report on the realization of a miniaturized setup, generating a flux of $4 \times 10^5$ quantum degenerate $^{87}$Rb atoms every 1.6 s. Ensembles of $1 \times 10^5$ atoms can be produced at a 1 Hz rate. This is achieved by loading a cold atomic beam directly into a multi-layer atom chip that is designed for efficient transfer from laser-cooled to magnetically trapped clouds. The attained flux of degenerate atoms is on par with current lab-based experiments while offering significantly higher repetition rates. The compact and robust design allows for mobile operation in a variety of demanding environments and paves the way for portable high-precision quantum sensors.

abstract: The energy of magnetic moment of the persistent current circulating in superconducting loop in an externally produced magnetic field is not taken into account in the theory of quantization effects because of identification of the Hamiltonian with the energy. This identification misleads if, in accordance with the conservation law, the energy of a state is the energy expended for its creation. The energy of magnetic moment is deduced from a creation history of the current state in magnetic field both in the classical and quantum case. But taking this energy into account demolishes the agreement between theory and experiment. Impartial consideration of this problem discovers the contradiction both in theory and experiment.

abstract: We discuss the precanonical quantization of fields which is based on the De Donder--Weyl (DW) Hamiltonian formulation and treats the space and time variables on an equal footing. Classical field equations in DW Hamiltonian form are derived as the equations for the expectation values of precanonical quantum operators. This field-theoretic generalization of the Ehrenfest theorem demonstrates the consistency of three aspects of precanonical field quantization: (i) the precanonical representation of operators in terms of the Clifford (Dirac) algebra valued partial differential operators, (ii) the Dirac-like precanonical generalization of the Schr\"odinger equation without the distinguished time dimension, and (iii) the definition of the scalar product for calculation of expectation values of operators using the Clifford-valued precanonical wave functions.

Furthermore, the PT-symmetric theory does not satisfy the usual Bogoliubov limit for the construction of the Green's functions because one obtains different results for the $h\to0^-$ and the $h\to0^+$ limits.

abstract: We study the time evolution of the entanglement negativity after a local quantum quench in conformal field theories (CFTs), where the local quench is introduced by joining two decoupled CFTs at their endpoints. We calculate the negativity evolution for both adjacent intervals and disjoint intervals explicitly. For two adjacent intervals, the entanglement negativity grows as $\ln t$ at the very beginning of a local quench, where $t$ is the time that elapses after the quench. After developing a plateau-like feature, the entanglement negativity drops to the ground-state value. For the case of two disjoint intervals, a light-cone behavior is observed in the negativity evolution; in addition, a long-range entanglement which is independent of the distance between two intervals can be created. Our results agree with the heuristic picture that quasiparticles which carry entanglement are emitted from the joining point and propagate freely through the system. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations based on a critical harmonic chain.

abstract: The uncertainty principle restricts our ability to simultaneously predict the measurement outcomes of two incompatible observables of a quantum particle. However, this uncertainty could be reduced and quantified by a new Entropic Uncertainty Relation (EUR). By the open quantum system approach, we explore how the nature of de Sitter space affects the EUR. When the quantum memory $A$ freely falls in the de Sitter space, we demonstrate that the entropic uncertainty acquires an increase resulting from a thermal bath with the Gibbons-Hawking temperature. And for the static case, we find that the temperature coming from both the intrinsic thermal nature of the de Sitter space and the Unruh effect associated with the proper acceleration of $A$ also brings effect on entropic uncertainty, and the higher temperature, the greater uncertainty and the quicker the uncertainty reaches the maxima value. And finally the possible mechanism behind this phenomenon is also explored.

abstract: We give a survey of the two remarkable analytical problems of quantum information theory. The main part is a detailed report of the recent (partial) solution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem which establishes an optimal property of Glauber's coherent states -- a particular instance of pure quantum Gaussian states. We elaborate on the notion of quantum Gaussian channel as a noncommutative generalization of Gaussian kernel to show that the coherent states, and under certain conditions only they, minimize a broad class of the concave functionals of the output of a Gaussian channel. Thus, the output states corresponding to the Gaussian input are "the least chaotic", majorizing all the other outputs. The solution, however, is essentially restricted to the gauge-invariant case where a distinguished complex structure plays a special role. We also comment on the related famous additivity conjecture, which was solved in principle in the negative some five years ago. This refers to the additivity or multiplicativity (with respect to tensor products of channels) of information quantities related to the classical capacity of quantum channel, such as $(1\rightarrow p)$-norms or the minimal von Neumann or R\'enyi output entropies. A remarkable corollary of the present solution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem is that these additivity properties, while not valid in general, do hold in the important and interesting class of the gauge-covariant Gaussian channels.

abstract: Solar cells are engines converting energy supplied by the photon flux into work. Any type of engine is also a self-oscillating system which yields a periodic motion at the expense of a usually non-periodic source of energy. This aspect is absent in the existing descriptions and the main goal of this paper is to show that plasma oscillations provide this necessary ingredient of work extraction process. Our approach is based on Markovian master equations which can be derived in a rigorous way from the underlying Hamiltonian models and are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.

abstract: Understanding the interaction between cavity photons and electronic nanocircuits is crucial for the development of Mesoscopic Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). One has to combine ingredients from atomic Cavity QED, like orbital degrees of freedom, with tunneling physics and strong cavity field inhomogeneities, specific to superconducting circuit QED. It is therefore necessary to introduce a formalism which bridges between these two domains. We develop a general method based on a photonic pseudo-potential to describe the electric coupling between electrons in a nanocircuit and cavity photons. In this picture, photons can induce simultaneously orbital energy shifts, tunneling, and local orbital transitions. We study in details the elementary example of a single quantum dot with a single normal metal reservoir, coupled to a cavity. Photon-induced tunneling terms lead to a non-universal relation between the cavity frequency pull and the damping pull. Our formalism can also be applied to multi quantum dot circuits, molecular circuits, quantum point contacts, metallic tunnel junctions, and superconducting nanostructures enclosing Andreev bound states or Majorana bound states, for instance.

These potentials provide accurate ab initio quartet scattering lengths, which for these many-electron systems is possible, because of the small reduced masses and shallow potentials that results in a small amount of bound states. Our results are relevant for ultracold metastable triplet helium + alkali-metal mixture experiments.

abstract: We investigate theoretically the generation of indistinguishable single photons from a strongly dissipative quantum system placed inside an optical cavity. The degree of indistinguishability of photons emitted by the cavity is calculated as a function of the emitter-cavity coupling strength and the cavity linewidth. For a quantum emitter subject to strong pure dephasing, our calculations reveal that an unconventional regime of high indistinguishability can be reached for moderate emittercavity coupling strengths and high quality factor cavities. In this regime, the broad spectrum of a dissipative quantum system is funneled into the narrow lineshape of a cavity. The associated efficiency is found to greatly surpass spectral filtering effects. Our findings open the path towards on-chip scalable indistinguishable-photon emitting devices operating at room temperature.

We find a rich phase diagram featuring a limit cycle phase in which the magnetization oscillates in time. We analyze the spatio-temporal fluctuations of this limit cycle phase at the Gaussian level, and show that spatial fluctuations lead to quasi-long-range limit cycle ordering for dimension $d = 2$. This result can be interpreted in terms of a spatio-temporal Goldstone mode corresponding to phase fluctuations of the limit cycle. We also demonstrate that the limit-cycle phase exhibits an asymmetric power spectrum measurable in fluorescence experiments.

abstract: Rescattering effects in nonresonant spontaneous laser-assisted electron-atom bremsstrahlung (LABrS) are analyzed within the framework of time-dependent effective-range (TDER) theory. It is shown that high energy LABrS spectra exhibit rescattering plateau structures that are similar to those that are well-known in strong field laser-induced processes as well as those that have been predicted theoretically in laser-assisted collision processes. In the limit of a low-frequency laser field, an analytic description of LABrS is obtained from a rigorous quantum analysis of the exact TDER results for the LABrS amplitude. This amplitude is represented as a sum of factorized terms involving three factors, each having a clear physical meaning. The first two factors are the exact field-free amplitudes for electron-atom bremsstrahlung and for electron-atom scattering, and the third factor describes free electron motion in the laser field along a closed trajectory between the first (scattering) and second (rescattering) collision events. Finally, a generalization of these TDER results to the case of LABrS in a Coulomb field is discussed.

abstract: Recently, there has been much attention devoted to resolving the quantum corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking (black hole) entropy, which relates the entropy to the cross-sectional area of the black hole horizon. Using generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), corrections to the geometric entropy and thermodynamics of black hole will be introduced. The impact of GUP on the entropy near the horizon of three types of black holes; Schwarzschild, Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger and Reissner-Nordstr\"om is determined. It is found that the logarithmic divergence in the entropy-area relation turns to be positive. The entropy $S$, which is assumed to be related to horizon's two-dimensional area, gets an additional terms, for instance $2\, \sqrt{\pi}\, \alpha\, \sqrt{S}$, where $\alpha$ is the GUP parameter.

abstract: We explore the dynamics of the entanglement entropy near equilibrium in highly-entangled pure states of two quantum-chaotic spin chains undergoing unitary time evolution. We examine the relaxation to equilibrium from initial states with either less or more entanglement entropy than the equilibrium value, as well as the dynamics of the spontaneous fluctuations of the entanglement that occur in equilibrium. For the spin chain with a time-independent Hamiltonian and thus an extensive conserved energy, we find slow relaxation of the entanglement entropy near equilibration. Such slow relaxation is absent in a Floquet spin chain with a Hamiltonian that is periodic in time and thus has no local conservation law. Therefore, we argue that slow diffusive energy transport is responsible for the slow relaxation of the entanglement entropy in the Hamiltonian system.

abstract: We explore the effect of the electrodynamics $\theta$-angle on the macroscopic properties of black hole horizons. Using only classical Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in (3+1)-dimensions, in the form of the membrane paradigm, we show that in the presence of the $\theta$-term, a black hole horizon behaves as a Hall conductor, for an observer hovering outside. We study how localized perturbations created on the stretched horizon scramble on the horizon by dropping a charged particle. We show that the $\theta$-angle affects the way perturbations scramble on the horizon, in particular, it introduces vortices without changing the scrambling time. This Hall scrambling of information is also expected to occur on cosmological horizons.

abstract: We present a novel method of machining optical fiber surfaces with a CO${}_2$ laser for use in Fiber-based Fabry-Perot Cavities (FFPCs). Previously FFPCs were prone to large birefringence and limited to relatively short cavity lengths ($\le$ 200 $\mu$m). These characteristics hinder their use in some applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics with trapped ions. We optimized the laser machining process to produce large, uniform surface structures. This enables the cavities to achieve high finesse even for long cavity lengths. By rotating the fibers around their axis during the laser machining process the asymmetry resulting from the laser's transverse mode profile is eliminated. Consequently we are able to fabricate fiber mirrors with a high degree of rotational symmetry, leading to remarkably low birefringence. Through measurements of the cavity finesse over a range of cavity lengths and the polarization dependence of the cavity linewidth, we confirmed the quality of the produced fiber mirrors for use in low-birefringence FFPCs.

abstract: We study the response of a magnetic-field-driven superconducting qubit strongly coupled to a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. We observed a strong amplification/damping of a probing signal at different resonance points corresponding to a one and two-photon emission/absorption. The sign of the detuning between the qubit frequency and the probe determines whether amplification or damping is observed. The larger blue detuned driving leads to two-photon lasing while the larger red detuning cools the resonator. Our experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical model of qubit lasing and cooling at the Rabi frequency.

abstract: When used in Electron-Spin Resonance (ESR) measurements, superconducting thin-film resonators must be precisely oriented relative to the external magnetic field in order to prevent the trapping of magnetic flux and the associated degradation of resonator performance. We present a compact design solution for this problem that allows in-situ control of the orientation of the resonator at cryogenic temperatures. Tests of the apparatus show that when proper alignment is achieved, there is almost no hysteresis in the field dependence of the resonant frequency.

abstract: We explore the entropic uncertainty relation in the curved background outside a Schwarzschild black hole, and find that Hawking radiation introduces a nontrivial modification on the uncertainty bound for particular observer, therefore it could be witnessed by proper uncertainty game experimentally. We first investigate an uncertainty game between a free falling observer and his static partner holding a quantum memory initially entangled with the quantum system to be measured. Due to the information loss from Hawking decoherence, we find an inevitable increase of the uncertainty on the outcome of measurements in the view of static observer, which is dependent on the mass of the black hole, the distance of observer from event horizon, and the mode frequency of quantum memory. To illustrate the generality of this paradigm, we relate the entropic uncertainty bound with other uncertainty probe, e.g., time-energy uncertainty. In an alternative game between two static players, we show that quantum information of qubit can be transferred to quantum memory through a bath of fluctuating quantum fields outside the black hole. For a particular choice of initial state, we show that the Hawking decoherence cannot counteract entanglement generation after the dynamical evolution of system, which triggers an effectively reduced uncertainty bound that violates the intrinsic limit $-\log_2c$. Numerically estimation for a proper choice of initial state shows that our result is comparable with possible real experiments. Finally, a discussion on the black hole firewall paradox in the context of entropic uncertainty relation is given.

abstract: We analyze free expansion of a trapped one-dimensional Bose gas after a sudden release from the confining trap potential. By using the stationary phase and local density approximations, we show that the long-time asymptotic density profile and the momentum distribution of the gas are determined by the initial distribution of Bethe rapidities (quasimomenta) and hence can be obtained from the solutions to the Lieb-Liniger equations in the thermodynamic limit. For expansion from a harmonic trap, and in the limits of very weak and very strong interactions, we recover the self-similar scaling solutions known from the hydrodynamic approach. For all other power-law traps and arbitrary interaction strengths, the expansion is not self-similar and shows strong dependence of the density profile evolution on the trap anharmonicity. We also characterize dynamical fermionization of the expanding cloud in terms of correlation functions describing phase and density fluctuations.

abstract: We investigate numerically charge, spin, and entanglement dynamics of two electrons confined in a gated semiconductor nanowire. The electrostatic coupling between electrons in the nanowire and the charges in the metal gates leads to a self-trapping of the electrons which results in soliton-like properties. We show that the interplay of an all-electrically controlled coherent transport of the electron solitons and of the exchange interaction can be used to realize ultrafast SWAP and entangling $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates for distant spin qubits. We demonstrate that the latter gate can be used to generate a maximally entangled spin state of spatially separated electrons. The results are obtained by quantum mechanical time-dependent calculations with exact inclusion of electron-electron correlations.

abstract: We propose a method of joint interrogation in a single atom interferometer which overcomes the dead time between consecutive measurements in standard cold atomic fountains. The joint operation enables for a faster averaging of the Dick effect associated with the local oscillator noise in clocks and with vibration noise in cold atom inertial sensors. Such an operation allows achieving the lowest stability limit due to atom shot noise. We demonstrate a multiple joint operation in which up to five clouds of atoms are interrogated simultaneously in a single setup. The essential feature of multiple joint operation, demonstrated here for a micro-wave Ramsey interrogation, can be generalized to go beyond the current stability limit associated with dead times in present-day cold atom interferometer inertial sensors.

abstract: The spin states of electrons and holes confined in InAs quantum dot molecules have recently come to fore as a promising system for the storage or manipulation of quantum information. We describe here a feasible scheme for complete quantum optical control of two electron spin qubits in two vertically-stacked singly-charged InAs quantum dots coupled by coherent electron tunneling. With an applied magnetic field transverse to the growth direction, we construct a universal set of gates that corresponds to the possible Raman transitions between the spin states. We detail the procedure to decompose a given two-qubit unitary operation, so as to realize it with a successive application of up to 8 of these gates. We give the pulse shapes for the laser pulses used to implement this universal set of gates and demonstrate the realization of the two-qubit quantum Fourier transform with fidelity of 0.881 and duration of 414 ps. Our proposal therefore offers an accessible path to universal computation in quantum dot molecules and points to the advantages of using pulse shaping incoherent manipulation of optically active quantum dots to mitigate the negative effects of unintended dynamics and spontaneous emission.

abstract: The spin echo approach is extended to include bio-complexes for which the interaction with dynamical noise is strong. Significant restoration of the free induction decay signal due to homogeneous (decoherence) and inhomogeneous (dephasing) broadening is demonstrated analytically and numerically, for both an individual dimer of interacting chlorophylls and for an ensemble of dimers. This approach is based on an exact and closed system of ordinary differential equations that can be easily solved for a wide range of parameters that are relevant for bio-applications.

abstract: A general method of the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is developed. This method is applicable to relativistic particles with any spin in arbitrarily strong external fields. It can be used when the de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic distance. Contrary to previously developed relativistic methods, the present method satisfies the condition of the exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation and is well substantiated. The derived relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian is expanded in powers of the Planck constant. In this expansion, terms proportional to the zero and first powers are determined exactly in accordance with the above condition and terms proportional to higher powers are not specified. The obtained result agrees with the corresponding formula for the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian previously deduced by an iterative relativistic method and proves the validity of results obtained with this formula.

This property can find applications to the synthesis of special Bragg filters and distributed-feedback (DFB) optical cavities. In particular, multiple SUSY (Darboux-Crum) transformations can be used to synthesize DFB filters with any desired number of resonances at target frequencies. As an example, we describe the design of a DFB structure with a set of equally-spaced resonances, i.e. a frequency comb transmission filter.

abstract: According to quantum mechanics chiral molecules, that is molecules that rotate the polarization of light, should not exist. The simplest molecules which can be chiral have four or more atoms with two arrangements of minimal potential energy that are equivalent up to a parity operation. Chiral molecules correspond to states localized in one potential energy minimum and can not be stationary states of the Schr\"odinger equation. A possible solution of the paradox can be founded on the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking. This idea was behind work we did previously involving a localization phase transition: at low pressure the molecules are delocalized between the two minima of the potential energy while at higher pressure they become localized in one minimum due to the intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions. Evidence for such a transition is provided by measurements of the inversion spectrum of ammonia and deuterated ammonia at different pressures. A previously proposed model gives a satisfactory account of the empirical results without free parameters. In this paper, we extend this model to gas mixtures. We find that also in these systems a phase transition takes place at a critical pressure which depends on the composition of the mixture. Moreover, we derive formulas giving the dependence of the inversion frequencies on the pressure. These predictions are susceptible to experimental test.

abstract: We study a pair of quantum dot exciton qubits interacting with a number of fluctuating charges that can induce a Stark shift of both exciton transition energies. We do this by solving the optical master equation using a numerical transfer matrix method. We find that the collective influence of the charge environment on the dots can be detected by measuring the correlation between the photons emitted when each dot is driven independently. Qubits in a common charge environment display photon bunching, if both dots are driven on resonance or if the driving laser detunings have the same sense for both qubits, and antibunching if the laser detunings have in opposite signs. We also show that it is possible to detect several charges fluctuating at different rates using this technique. Our findings expand the possibility of measuring qubit dynamics in order to investigate the fundamental physics of the environmental noise that causes decoherence.

abstract: Using an approach inspired from Spin Glasses, we show that the multimode disordered Dicke model is equivalent to a quantum Hopfield network. We propose variational ground states for the system at zero temperature, which we conjecture to be exact in the thermodynamic limit. These ground states contain the information on the disordered qubit-photon couplings. These results lead to two intriguing physical implications. First, once the qubit-photon couplings can be engineered, it should be possible to build scalable pattern-storing systems whose dynamics is governed by quantum laws. Second, we argue with an example how such Dicke quantum simulators might be used as a solver of "hard" combinatorial optimization problems.

Over a wide range of interaction strengths we find excellent agreement with predictions based on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory of 2d superfluidity. This allows us to quantitatively show, without any free parameters, that the interaction-driven BKT transition smoothly converges onto the purely statistical Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition in the limit of vanishing interactions.

In application we demonstrate arbitrary large current rectification in the presence of interaction.

abstract: The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula is a general result for the quantity $Z(X,Y)=\ln( e^X e^Y )$, where $X$ and $Y$ are not necessarily commuting. For completely general commutation relations between $X$ and $Y$, (the free Lie algebra), the general result is somewhat unwieldy. However in specific physics applications the commutator $[X,Y]$, while non-zero, might often be relatively simple, which sometimes leads to explicit closed form results. We consider the special case $[X,Y] = u X + vY + cI$, and show that in this case the general result reduces to \[ Z(X,Y)=\ln( e^X e^Y ) = X+Y+ f(u,v) \; [X,Y]. \] Furthermore we explicitly evaluate the symmetric function $f(u,v)=f(v,u)$, demonstrating that \[ f(u,v) = {(u-v)e^{u+v}-(ue^u-ve^v)\over u v (e^u - e^v)}, \] and relate this to previously known results. For instance this result includes, but is considerably more general than, results obtained from either the Heisenberg commutator $[P,Q]=-i\hbar I$ or the creation-destruction commutator $[a,a^\dagger]=I$.

abstract: We propose a definition for the entanglement entropy of a gauge theory on a spatial lattice. Our definition applies to any subset of links in the lattice, and is valid for both Abelian and Non-Abelian gauge theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $U(1)$ theories, without matter, our definition agrees with a particular case of the definition given by Casini, Huerta and Rosabal. We also argue that in general, both for Abelian and Non-Abelian theories, our definition agrees with the entanglement entropy calculated using a definition of the replica trick. Our definition, however, does not agree with some standard ways to measure entanglement, like the number of Bell pairs which can be produced by entanglement distillation.

abstract: We study the quantum many-body dynamics in the entropy production of $N=10$ interacting identical bosons in an external one-dimensional harmonic trap. The multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons or MCTDHB is used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation at a very high level of accuracy. We introduce new and genuinely many-body measures for the entropy production that relate to the time-dependent many-body basis set used in MCTDHB. With these measures, we demonstrate the transition from regular or quasi-periodic to irregular or chaotic dynamics. We compute the time-evolution of quantum information (Shannon) entropy, number of principal basis components and inverse participation ratio related to the MCTDHB basis set for various repulsive interaction strengths. The many-body Shannon information entropy approaches the value of $\ln(0.48 D)$, where $D$ is the number of time-dependent many-body states employed in the MCTDHB computations for larger interaction strength, as predicted by the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of random matrices. This is a clear signature of statistical relaxation, here demonstrated for the first time with a genuine many-body entropy measure. Since the basis of MCTDHB is explicitly time-dependent and optimized by the variational principle in a way that minimizes the number of significantly contributing basis functions it is a non-trivial fact that statistical relaxation prevails in MCTDHB computations. Moreover, we find a fundamental connection between the production of entropy, the build-up of correlations and the loss of coherence. Last, we point out that mean-field methods fail to describe the production of entropy and statistical relaxation quantified by many-body measures.

abstract: Transverse spin diffusion in a polarized, interacting Fermi gas leads to the Leggett-Rice effect, where the spin current precesses around the local magnetization. With a spin-echo sequence both the transverse diffusivity and the spin-rotation parameter $\gamma$ are obtained; the sign of $\gamma$ reveals the repulsive or attractive character of the effective interaction. In a trapped Fermi gas the spin diffusion equations become nonlinear, and their numerical solution exhibits an inhomogeneous spin state even at the spin echo time. While the microscopic diffusivity and $\gamma$ increase at weak coupling, their apparent values inferred from the trap-averaged magnetization saturate in agreement with a recent experiment for a dilute ultracold Fermi gas.

abstract: We use the multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz (MERA) to numerically investigate three critical quantum spin chains with Z_2 x Z_2 on-site symmetry: a staggered XXZ model, a transverse field cluster model, and the quantum Ashkin-Teller model. All three models possess a continuous one-parameter family of critical points. Along this critical line, the thermodynamic limit of these models is expected to be described by classes of c=1 conformal field theories (CFTs) of two possible types: the S^1 free boson and its Z_2-orbifold. Our numerics using MERA with explicitly enforced Z_2 x Z_2 symmetry allow us to extract conformal data for each model, with strong evidence supporting the identification of the staggered XXZ model and critical transverse field cluster model with the S^1 boson CFT, and the Ashkin-Teller model with the Z_2-orbifold boson CFT. Our first two models describe the phase transitions between symmetry protected topologically ordered phases and trivial phases, which lie outside the usual Landau-Ginsburg-Wilson paradigm of symmetry breaking. Our results show that a range of critical theories can arise at the boundary of a single symmetry protected phase.

The obtained closed forms are applied to calculate the single particle energy levels of neutron orbiting around $^{56}$Fe nucleus in order to check consistency between the analytical and Gamow code results. The analytical results are in good agreement with the results obtained by Gamow code for $\ell=0$.

These shifts have to be taken into account in precision experiments.

abstract: In their simplest formulations, classical dynamics is the study of Hamiltonian flows and quantum mechanics that of propagators. Both are linked, and emerge from the datum of a single classical concept, the Hamiltonian function. We study and emphasize the analogies between Hamiltonian flows and quantum propagators; this allows us to verify G. Mackey's observation that quantum mechanics (in its Weyl formulation) is a refinement of Hamiltonian mechanics. We discuss in detail the metaplectic representation, which very explicitly shows the close relationship between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, the latter emerging from the first by lifting Hamiltonian flows to the double covering of the symplectic group. We also give explicit formulas for the factorization of Hamiltonian flows into simpler flows, and prove a quantum counterpart of these results.

abstract: Experimental realizations of disorder in optical lattices generate a distribution of the Bose-Hubbard (BH) parameters, like on-site potentials, hopping strengths, and interaction energies. We analyze this distribution for bosons in a bichromatic quasi-periodic potential by determining the generalized Wannier functions and calculating the corresponding BH parameters. Using a local mean-field cluster analysis, we study the effect of the corresponding disorder on the phase diagrams. We find a substantial amount of disorder in the hopping strengths, which produces strong deviations from the phase diagram of the disordered BH model with solely random on-site potentials.

abstract: The single-particle density is the most basic quantity that can be calculated from a given many-body wave function. It provides the probability to find a particle at a given position when the average over many realizations of an experiment is taken. However, the outcome of single experimental shots of ultracold atom experiments is determined by the $N$-particle probability density. This difference can lead to surprising results. For example, independent Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with definite particle numbers form interference fringes even though no fringes would be expected based on the single-particle density [1-4]. By drawing random deviates from the $N$-particle probability density single experimental shots can be simulated from first principles [1, 3, 5]. However, obtaining expressions for the $N$-particle probability density of realistic time-dependent many-body systems has so far been elusive. Here, we show how single experimental shots of general ultracold bosonic systems can be simulated based on numerical solutions of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. We show how full counting distributions of observables involving any number of particles can be obtained and how correlation functions of any order can be evaluated. As examples we show the appearance of interference fringes in interacting independent BECs, fluctuations in the collisions of strongly attractive BECs, the appearance of randomly fluctuating vortices in rotating systems and the center of mass fluctuations of attractive BECs in a harmonic trap. The method described is broadly applicable to bosonic many-body systems whose phenomenology is driven by information beyond what is typically available in low-order correlation functions.

abstract: The collective excitations in ensembles of dissipative, laser driven ultracold atoms exhibit crystal-like patterns, a many-body effect of the Rydberg blockade mechanism. These crystalline structure are revealed in experiment from a post-selection of configurations with fixed numbers of excitations. Here, we show that these sub-ensemble can be well represented by ensembles of effective particles that interact via logarithmic pair potentials. This allows one to study the emergent patterns with a small number of effective particles to determine the phases of Rydberg crystals and to systematically study contributions from $N$-body terms.

abstract: We consider a Bose-Hubbard trimer, i.e. an ultracold Bose gas populating three quantum states. The latter can be either different sites of a triple-well potential or three internal states of the atoms. The bosons can tunnel between different states with variable tunnelling strength between two of them. This will allow us to study; i) different geometrical configurations, i.e. from a closed triangle to three aligned wells and ii) a triangular configuration with a $\pi$-phase, i.e. by setting one of the tunnellings negative. By solving the corresponding three-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian we obtain the ground state of the system as a function of the trap topology. We characterise the different ground states by means of the coherence and entanglement properties. For small repulsive interactions, fragmented condensates are found for the $\pi$-phase case. These are found to be robust against small variations of the tunnelling in the small interaction regime. A low-energy effective many-body Hamiltonian restricted to the degenerate manifold provides a compelling description of the $\pi$-phase degeneration and explains the low-energy spectrum as excitations of discrete semifluxon states.

abstract: Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors are rapidly emerging as a key infrared photon-counting technology. Two front-side-coupled silver dipole nanoantennas, simulated to have resonances at 1480 nm and 1525 nm, were fabricated in a two-step process. An enhancement of 50% to 130% in the system detection efficiency was observed when illuminating the antennas. This offers a pathway to increasing absorption into superconducting nanowires, creating larger active areas, and achieving more efficient detection at longer wavelengths.

abstract: The magnetic state of a quantum dot attached to superconducting leads is experimentally shown to be controlled by the superconducting phase difference across the dot. This is done by probing the relation between the Josephson current and the superconducting phase difference of a carbon nanotube junction whose Kondo energy and superconducting gap are of comparable size. It exhibits distinctively anharmonic behavior, revealing a phase mediated singlet to doublet transition. We obtain an excellent quantitative agreement with numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo calculations. This provides strong support that we indeed observed the finite temperature signatures of the phase controlled zero temperature level-crossing transition originating from strong local electronic correlations.

In characterizing the gain of this device we find that, in addition to the direct stimulated emission of photons, there is a large contribution from the simultaneous emission of a photon and a phonon, i.e., the phonon sideband. We show that this phonon-assisted gain typically dominates the overall gain which leads to masing. Recent experimental data are well fit with our model.

abstract: We explore the properties of bosonic atoms loaded into the d bands of an isotropic square optical lattice. Following the recent experimental success reported in [Y. Zhai et al., Phys. Rev. A 87, 063638 (2013)], in which populating d bands with a 99% fidelity was demonstrated, we present a theoretical study of the possible phases that can appear in this system. Using the Gutzwiller ansatz for the three d band orbitals we map the boundaries of the Mott insulating phases. For not too large occupation, two of the orbitals are predominantly occupied, while the third, of a slightly higher energy, remains almost unpopulated. In this regime, in the superfluid phase we find the formation of a vortex lattice, where the vortices come in vortex/anti-vortex pairs with two pairs locked to every site. Due to the orientation of the vortices time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken. This state also breaks a discrete Z2-symmetry. We further derive an effective spin-1/2 model that describe the relevant physics of the lowest Mott-phase with unit filling. We argue that the corresponding two dimensional phase diagram should be rich with several different phases. We also explain how to generate antisymmetric spin interactions that can give rise to novel effects like spin canting.

abstract: We report a combined experimental and theoretical simulation of multiply scattered light dynamics in an ultracold gas of 85Rb atoms. Measurements of the spectral dependence of the time-decay of the scattered light intensity, following pulsed excitation with near resonance radiation, reveals that the decay for long times is nearly exponential, with a decay constant that is largely independent of detuning from resonance. Monte Carlo simulations of the multiple scattering process show that, for large detunings, near resonance scattering of Fourier components of the excitation pulse plays a significant role in the effect. This interpretation is supported by the observations, and successful modelling, of beating between Rayleigh scattered light at the excitation carrier frequency with the Fourier components of the excitation pulse that overlap significantly with the atomic resonance.

Based on a geometric interpretation of the so-called $|W\rangle$ and $|GHZ\rangle$ states we show that the classification of all multipartite systems featuring those and only those two classes of genuine entanglement can be deduced from earlier work of algebraic geometers. This classification corresponds in fact to classification of fundamental subadjoint varieties and establish a connection between those systems, well known in Quantum Information Theory and fundamental simple Lie algebras.

Starting from a modified Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the dipole approximation that takes into account the coupling of the atomic system to the electromagnetic fields the Roentgen interaction term is introduced and viewed within the context of such a Raman transition. A rigorous investigation of the corresponding Rabi frequency reveals that the Roentgen term acts at different levels compared to the (-d.E) term and thus would not cause any changes in a fully quantum mechanical treatment.

abstract: A study of the photophysical properties of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond nanocrystals of size of 50~nm or below is carried out by means of second-order time-intensity photon correlation and cross-correlation measurements as a function of the excitation power for both pure charge states, neutral and negatively charged, as well as for the photochromic state, where the center switches between both states at any power. A dedicated three-level model implying a shelving level is developed to extract the relevant photophysical parameters coupling all three levels. Our analysis confirms the very existence of the shelving level for the neutral NV center. It is found that it plays a negligible role on the photophysics of this center, whereas it is responsible for an increasing photon bunching behavior of the negative NV center with increasing power. From the photophysical parameters, we infer a quantum efficiency for both centers, showing that it remains close to unity for the neutral center over the entire power range, whereas it drops with increasing power from near unity to approximately 0.5 for the negative center. The photophysics of the photochromic center reveals a rich phenomenology that is to a large extent dominated by that of the negative state, in agreement with the excess charge release of the negative center being much slower than the photon emission process.

We demonstrate the basic functionality of the trap by cooling a single ion to the quantum ground state, allowing us to measure a heating rate from the ground state of 787(24) quanta/s. Variation of the fabrication procedure used here may provide access to traps in this geometry with trap scales between 100 um and 10 um.

The retarded Green's functions of the Dirac electron and Einstein photon viewed as complex matrix-vaued functionals on bump functionals, also yield generalized complex matrix-valued processes of Cauchy-Dirac and Cauchy-Maxwell, which are generalized functional on the bump functionals on Borel cylindrical sets of a real Hilbert space, but their supports are compact for the uniform convergence topology with derivatives in $L_2 (0,t)$. We study the way the classical relativistic mechanics of particle comes from the quantum mechanics of the free Dirac particle.

abstract: The dynamics of quantum field theories on bounded domains requires the introduction of boundary conditions on the quantum fields. We address the problem from a very general perspective by using charge conservation as a fundamental principle for scalar and fermionic quantum field theories. Unitarity arises as a consequence of the choice of charge preserving boundary conditions. This provides a powerful framework for the analysis of global geometrical and topological properties of the space of physical boundary conditions. Boundary conditions which allow the existence of edge states can only arise in theories with a mass gap which is also a physical requirement for topological insulators.

abstract: In this article, we study the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect for non-Abelian gauge fields. We use two well known time-dependent solutions to the Yang-Mills field equations to investigate the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. For both of the solutions, we find a cancellation between the phase shift coming from the non-Abelian "magnetic" field and the phase shift coming from the non-Abelian "electric" field, which inevitably arises in time-dependent cases. We compare and contrast this cancellation for the time-dependent non-Abelian case to a similar cancellation which occurs in the time-dependent Abelian case. We postulate that this cancellation occurs generally in time-dependent situations for both Abelian and non-Abelian fields.

The result for the three-loop contribution coincides in five significant figures with one given long ago by J.~Zinn-Justin. Unlike the two-loop contribution where all involved Feynman integrals are rational numbers, in the three-loop case Feynman diagrams can contain irrational contributions.

abstract: To demonstrate the role played by the von Neumann entropy spectra in quantum phase transitions we investigate the one-dimensional anisotropic SU(2)$\otimes XXZ$ spin-orbital model with negative exchange parameter. In the case of classical Ising orbital interactions we discover an unexpected novel phase with Majumdar-Ghosh-like spin-singlet dimer correlations triggered by spin-orbital entanglement and having $k=\pi/2$ orbital correlations, while all the other phases are disentangled. For anisotropic $XXZ$ orbital interactions both spin-orbital entanglement and spin-dimer correlations extend to the antiferro-spin/alternating-orbital phase. This quantum phase provides a unique example of two coupled order parameters which change the character of the phase transition from first-order to continuous. Hereby we have established the von Neumann entropy spectral function as a valuable tool to identify the change of ground state degeneracies and of the spin-orbital entanglement of elementary excitations in quantum phase transitions.

abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the SU($N$) Hubbard model describing fermionic alkaline earth atoms in a square optical lattice with on-average one atom per site, using a slave-rotor mean-field approximation. We find that the chiral spin liquid predicted for $N\ge5$ and large interactions passes through a fractionalized state with a spinon Fermi surface as interactions are decreased before transitioning to a weakly interacting metal. We also show that by adding an artificial uniform magnetic field with flux per plaquette $2\pi/N$, the chiral spin liquid becomes the ground state for all $N\ge 3$ at large interactions, persists to weaker interactions, and its spin gap increases, suggesting that the spin liquid physics will persist to higher temperatures. We discuss potential methods to realize the artificial gauge fields and detect the predicted phases.

abstract: We consider a Bohmian approach to the Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model and investigate the question whether or not there are singularities, in the sense that the universe reaches zero volume. We find that for generic wave functions (i.e., non-classical wave functions), there is a non-zero probability for a trajectory to be non-singular. This should be contrasted to the consistent histories approach for which it was recently shown by Craig and Singh that there is always a singularity. This result illustrates that the question of singularities depends much on which version of quantum theory one adopts. This was already pointed out by Pinto-Neto et al., albeit with a different Bohmian approach. Our current Bohmian approach agrees with the consistent histories approach by Craig and Singh for single-time histories, unlike the one studied earlier by Pinto-Neto et al. Although the trajectories are usually different in the two Bohmian approach, their qualitative behavior is the same for generic wave functions.

abstract: The entanglement entropy and the logarithmic negativity can be computed in quantum field theory through a method based on the replica limit. Performing these analytic continuations in some cases is beyond our current knowledge, even for simple models. We employ a numerical method based on rational interpolations to extrapolate the entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals for the conformal field theories given by the free compact boson and the Ising model. The case of three disjoint intervals is studied for the Ising model and the non compact free massless boson. For the latter model, the logarithmic negativity of two disjoint intervals has been also considered. Some of our findings have been checked against existing numerical results obtained from the corresponding lattice models.

abstract: A continuous-time quantum walk on a graph $X$ is represented by the complex matrix $\exp (-\mathrm{i} t A)$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of $X$ and $t$ is a non-negative time. If the graph models a network of interacting qubits, transfer of state among such qubits throughout time can be formalized as the action of the continuous-time quantum walk operator in the characteristic vectors of the vertices. Here we are concerned with the problem of determining which graphs admit a perfect transfer of state. More specifically, we will study graphs whose adjacency matrix is a sum of tensor products of $01$-matrices, focusing on the case where a graph is the tensor product of two other graphs. As a result, we will construct many new examples of perfect state transfer.

abstract: In order to obtain perfect state transfer between two sites in a network of interacting qubits, their corresponding vertices in the underlying graph must satisfy a combinatorial property called strong cospectrality. Here we determine the structure of graphs containing pairs of vertices which are strongly cospectral and satisfy a certain extremal property related to the spectrum of the graph. If the graph satisfies this property globally and is regular, we also show that the existence of a partition of the vertex set into pairs of vertices at maximum distance admitting perfect state transfer forces the graph to be distance-regular.

In particular, we describe a "Laguerre analogue" of the classical Fock (Segal-Bargmann) space and the relevant semi-classical asymptotics of its Toeplitz operators; the former actually turns out to coincide with the Hilbert space appearing in the construction of the well-known Barut-Girardello coherent states. Further extension to the case of Legendre polynomials is likewise discussed.

abstract: 'Quasi-adiabatic continuation', introduced first in the seminal work [Hastings 2004], has proven a successful technique for studying locality properties in gapped quantum lattice systems. For example, when a gapped Hamiltonian is perturbed locally in a region $S$, then the quasi-adiabatic continuation describes the resulting change in the ground state by a quasi-local transformation whose strength decays 'sub-exponentially' with distance to $S$. Here we address the natural question whether this decay can be made exponential, with characteristic decay length roughly the correlation length $\xi$ of the ground states. We point out that (a slight generalization of) [Hamza et al. 2009] allows to do this in some cases. As applications, we improve the locality estimate in some results on topological order and we prove some exponential decay estimates in models with impurities, where some relevant correlations decay faster than one would naively infer from the global gap of the system, as one also expects in disordered systems with many-body localization.

abstract: A detailed theory describing linear optics of vapors comprised of interacting multi-level quantum emitters is proposed. It is shown both by direct integration of Maxwell-Bloch equations and using a simple analytical model that at large densities narrow transparency windows appear in otherwise completely opaque spectra. The existence of such windows is attributed to overlapping resonances. This effect, first introduced for three-level systems in [R. Puthumpally-Joseph, M. Sukharev, O. Atabek and E. Charron, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 163603 (2014)], is due to strongly enhanced dipole-dipole interactions at high emitters' densities. The presented theory extends this effect to the case of multilevel systems. The theory is applied to the D1 transitions of interacting Rb-85 atoms. It is shown that at high atomic densities, Rb-85 atoms can behave as three-level emitters exhibiting all the properties of dipole induced electromagnetic transparency. Applications including slow light and laser pulse shaping are also proposed.

abstract: Frustration in quantum many body systems is quantified by the degree of incompatibility between the local and global orders associated, respectively, to the ground states of the local interaction terms and the global ground state of the total many-body Hamiltonian. This universal measure is bounded from below by the ground-state bipartite block entanglement. For many-body Hamiltonians that are sums of two-body interaction terms, a further inequality relates quantum frustration to the pairwise entanglement between the constituents of the local interaction terms. This additional bound is a consequence of the limits imposed by monogamy on entanglement shareability. We investigate the behavior of local pair frustration in quantum spin models with competing interactions on different length scales and show that valence bond solids associated to exact ground-state dimerization correspond to a transition from generic frustration, i.e. geometric, common to classical and quantum systems alike, to genuine quantum frustration, i.e. solely due to the non-commutativity of the different local interaction terms. We discuss how such frustration transitions separating genuinely quantum orders from classical-like ones are detected by observable quantities such as the static structure factor and the interferometric visibility.

abstract: We study the interspecies scattering properties of ultracold Li-Cs mixtures in their two energetically lowest spin channels in the magnetic field range between 800 G and 1000 G. Close to two broad Feshbach resonances we create weakly bound LiCs dimers by radio-frequency association and measure the dependence of the binding energy on the external magnetic field strength. Based on the binding energies and complementary atom loss spectroscopy of three other Li-Cs s-wave Feshbach resonances we construct precise molecular singlet and triplet electronic ground state potentials using a coupled-channels calculation. We extract the Li-Cs interspecies scattering length as a function of the external field and obtain almost a ten-fold improvement in the precision of the values for the pole positions and widths of the s-wave Li-Cs Feshbach resonances as compared to our previous work [Pires \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{112}, 250404 (2014)]. We discuss implications on the Efimov scenario and the universal geometric scaling for LiCsCs trimers.

abstract: Lately, so-called "quantum" models, based on parts of the mathematics of quantum mechanics, have been developed in decision theory and cognitive sciences to account for seemingly irrational or paradoxical human judgments. In this paper, we limit ourselves to such quantum-like models that address question order effects, i. e. cases in which given answers depend on the order of presentation of the questions. From the quantum law of reciprocity, we derive new empirical predictions that we call the Grand Reciprocity equations, that must be satisfied by many existing quantum-like models, on the condition that they are non-degenerate. Using only existing data sets, we show that most models on which these equations apply fail the test. We take it to suggest that degenerate quantum-like models should be the focus of forthcoming research in the area, and that more research should be done on the empirical adequacy of quantum-like models more generally.

abstract: We develop a monadic framework formalising an operational notion of dynamics, seen as the setting and evolution of initial value problems, in general physical theories. We identify in the Eilenberg-Moore category the natural environment for dynamical systems and characterise Cauchy surfaces abstractly as automorphisms in the Kleisli category. Our main results formally vindicates the Aristotelian view that time and change are defined by one another. We show that dynamics which respect the compositional structure of physical systems always define a canonical notion of time, and give the conditions under which they can be faithfully seen as actions of time on physical systems. Finally, we construct state spaces and path spaces, and show that our framework to be equivalent to the path space approaches to dynamics. The monadic standpoint is thus as strong as the established paradigms, but the shift from histories to dynamics helps shed new light on the nature of time in physics. In the appendix we present some additional structures of wide applicability, introduce prop- agators and draft applications to quantum theory, classical mechanics and network theory.

abstract: Using an effective field theory we describe the low energy bosonic excitations in a three dimensional ultra-cold mixture of spin-1 bosons and spin-1/2 fermions. We establish an interesting fermionic excitation induced generic damping of the usual undamped long wavelength bosonic collective Goldstone modes. Two states with bosons forming either a ferromagnetic or polar superfluid are studied. The linear dispersion of the bosonic Bogoliubov excitations is preserved with a renormalized sound velocity. For the polar superfluid we find both gapless modes (density and spin) are damped, whereas in the ferromagnetic superfluid we find the density (spin) mode is (not) damped. We argue quite generally that this holds for any mixture of bosons and fermions that are coupled through at least a density-density interaction. We discuss the implications of our many-body interaction results for experiments on Bose-Fermi mixtures.

abstract: The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series computes the quantity \begin{equation*} Z(X,Y)=\ln\left( e^X e^Y \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty z_n(X,Y), \end{equation*} where $X$ and $Y$ are not necessarily commuting, in terms of homogeneous multinomials $z_n(X,Y)$ of degree $n$. (This is essentially equivalent to computing the so-called Goldberg coefficients.) The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series is a general purpose tool of wide applicability in mathematical physics, quantum physics, and many other fields. The Reinsch algorithm for the truncated series permits one to calculate up to some fixed order $N$ by using $(N+1)\times(N+1)$ matrices. We show how to further simplify the Reinsch algorithm, making implementation (in principle) utterly straightforward. This helps provide a deeper understanding of the Goldberg coefficients and their properties. For instance we establish strict bounds (and some equalities) on the number of non-zero Goldberg coefficients. Unfortunately, we shall see that the number of terms in the multinomial $z_n(X,Y)$ often grows very rapidly (in fact exponentially) with the degree $n$. We also present some closely related results for the symmetric product \begin{equation*} S(X,Y)=\ln\left( e^{X/2} e^Y e^{X/2} \right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty s_n(X,Y). \end{equation*} Variations on these themes are straightforward. For instance, one can just as easily consider the series \begin{equation*} L(X,Y)=\ln\left( e^{X} e^Y e^{-X} e^{-Y}\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \ell_n(X,Y). \end{equation*} This type of series is of interest, for instance, when considering parallel transport around a closed curve. Several other related series are investigated.

abstract: We consider the dynamics of rotational excitations placed on a single molecule in spatially disordered 1D, 2D and 3D ensembles of ultracold molecules trapped in optical lattices. The disorder arises from incomplete populations of optical lattices with molecules. This leads to a model corresponding to a quantum particle with long-range tunnelling amplitudes moving on a lattice with the same on-site energy but with forbidden access to random sites (vacancies). We examine the time and length scales of Anderson localization for this type of disorder with realistic experimental parameters in the Hamiltonian. We show that for an experimentally realized system of KRb molecules on an optical lattice this type of disorder leads to disorder-induced localization in 1D and 2D systems on a time scale $t \sim 1$ sec. For 3D lattices with $55$ sites in each dimension and vacancy concentration $ 90~\%$, the rotational excitations diffuse to the edges of the lattice and show no signature of Anderson localization. We examine the role of the long-range tunnelling amplitudes allowing for transfer of rotational excitations between distant lattice sites. Our results show that the long-range tunnelling has little impact on the dynamics in the diffusive regime but affects significantly the localization dynamics in lattices with large concentrations of vacancies, enhancing the width of the localized distributions in 2D lattices by more than a factor of 2. Our results raise a general question whether quantum particles with long-range tunnelling can undergo quantum localization in 3D lattices with substitutional disorder.

abstract: We study the quantum kicked rotator in the classically fully chaotic regime $K=10$ and for various values of the quantum parameter $k$ using Izrailev's $N$-dimensional model for various $N \le 3000$, which in the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ tends to the exact quantized kicked rotator. By numerically calculating the eigenfunctions in the basis of the angular momentum we find that the localization length ${\cal L}$ for fixed parameter values has a certain distribution, in fact its inverse is Gaussian distributed, in analogy and in connection with the distribution of finite time Lyapunov exponents of Hamilton systems. However, unlike the case of the finite time Lyapunov exponents, this distribution is found to be independent of $N$, and thus survives the limit $N=\infty$. This is different from the tight-binding model of Anderson localization. The reason is that the finite bandwidth approximation of the underlying Hamilton dynamical system in the Shepelyansky picture (D.L. Shepelyansky, {\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 56}, 677 (1986)) does not apply rigorously. This observation explains the strong fluctuations in the scaling laws of the kicked rotator, such as e.g. the entropy localization measure as a function of the scaling parameter $\Lambda={\cal L}/N$, where $\cal L$ is the theoretical value of the localization length in the semiclassical approximation. These results call for a more refined theory of the localization length in the quantum kicked rotator and in similar Floquet systems, where we must predict not only the mean value of the inverse of the localization length $\cal L$ but also its (Gaussian) distribution, in particular the variance. In order to complete our studies we numerically analyze the related behavior of finite time Lyapunov exponents in the standard map and of the 2$\times$2 transfer matrix formalism. This paper is extending our recent work.

abstract: We consider three-body recombination into deep dimers in a mass-imbalanced two-component atomic gas. We use an optical model where a phenomenological imaginary potential is added to the lowest adiabatic hyper-spherical potential. The consequent imaginary part of the energy eigenvalue corresponds to the decay rate or recombination probability of the three-body system. The method is formulated in details and the relevant qualitative features are discussed as functions of scattering lengths and masses. We use zero-range model in analyses of recent recombination data. The dominating scattering length is usually related to the non-equal two-body systems. We account for temperature smearing which tends to wipe out the higher-lying Efimov peaks. The range and the strength of the imaginary potential determine positions and shapes of the Efimov peaks as well as the absolute value of the recombination rate. The Efimov scaling between recombination peaks is calculated and shown to depend on both scattering lengths. Recombination is predicted to be largest for heavy-heavy-light systems. Universal properties of the optical parameters are indicated. We compare to available experiments and find in general very satisfactory agreement.

abstract: We show the possibility of controlling the dynamical behavior of a single fiber ring (SFR) resonator system with the fiber being an amplified (gain) channel and the ring being attenuated (loss) nonlinear dielectric medium. The system considered here is a simple alteration in the basic building block of the parity time (PT) symmetric synthetic coupler structures reported in A. Regensburger et al., Nature 488, 167 (2012). We find that this result in a dynamically controllable algorithm for the chaotic dynamics inherent in the system. We have also shown the dependence of the period doubling point upon the input amplitude, emphasizing on the dynamical aspects of our system. Moreover, the fact that the resonator essentially plays the role of a damped harmonic oscillator has been elucidated with the non-zero intensity inside the resonator due to constant influx of input light. This study may be a step forward to further investigations in regard to the inter-connectivity between the PT symmetry and chaos along with possible device applications.

Specifically, we predict that graphene nano-ribbons can be used as saturable absorbers with low saturation intensity in the far-infrared and terahertz spectrum. Moreover, we predict that two-plasmon absorption and extreme localization of plasmon fields in graphene nano-disks can lead to a plasmon blockade effect, in which a single quantized plasmon strongly suppresses the possibility of exciting a second plasmon.

abstract: Propagation of monochromatic extraordinary light in a hyperbolic metamaterial is identical to propagation of massive particles in a three dimensional effective Minkowski spacetime, in which the role of a timelike variable is played by one of the spatial coordinates. We demonstrate that this analogy may be used to build a metamaterial model of a time crystal, which has been recently suggested by Wilczek and Shapere. It is interesting to note that the effective single-particle energy spectrum in such a model does not contain a static ground state, thus providing a loophole in the proof of time crystal non-existence by P. Bruno.

abstract: Versatile controllability of interactions in ultracold atomic and molecular gases has now reached an unprecedented era where quantum correlations and unconventional many-body phases can be studied with no corresponding analogs in solid state systems. Recent experiments in Rydberg atomic gases have achieved exquisite control over non-local interactions, allowing novel quantum phases unreachable with the usual local interactions in atomic systems. Here, we study Rydberg dressed atomic fermions in a three dimensional optical lattice predicting the existence of hitherto unheard-of exotic mixed topological density wave phases. We show that varying spatial range of the non-local interaction leads to a rich phase diagram containing various bond density waves, with unexpected spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Quasiparticles in these chiral phases experience emergent gauge fields and form three dimensional quantum Hall and Weyl semimetal states. Remarkably, certain density waves even exhibit mixed topologies beyond the existing topological classification. Experimental signatures of density waves and their topological properties are predicted in time-of-flight measurements.

Besides, a new definition of Boltzmann entropy for a quantum closed system is also given to count microstates in a way consistent with the superposition principle. In particular, this new Boltzmann entropy is a constant that depends only on the dimension of the system's relevant Hilbert subspace. Finally, thermodynamics for quantum systems is investigated formally.

abstract: Quantum particles in a disordered potential, photons or classical waves in a random medium, or the universe expansion in a fluctuating cosmic field, all share Anderson localization as a communality. In general, localization is enhanced for strong disorder and low dimensions. In one dimension and for discrete uncorrelated random potentials, such as tight binding models, all states are localized for any disorder strength. This is in contrast to continuous random potentials, where we show here that regardless of the strength of the random potential, we have delocalization in the limit where the roughness length goes to zero. This result was obtained by deriving an expression for the localization length valid for all disorder strengths. We solved a non-linear wave equation, whose average over disorder yields the localization properties of the desired linear wave equation. Our results, not only explain the origin of the difficulty to observe localization in certain physical systems, but also show that maximum localization occurs when the roughness length is comparable to the wavelength, which is relevant to many experiments in a random medium.

abstract: Spin systems with frustration and disorder are notoriously difficult to study both analytically and numerically. While the simulation of ferromagnetic statistical mechanical models benefits greatly from cluster algorithms, these accelerated dynamics methods remain elusive for generic spin-glass-like systems. Here we present a cluster algorithm for Ising spin glasses that works in any space dimension and speeds up thermalization by several orders of magnitude at temperatures where thermalization is typically difficult. Our isoenergetic cluster moves are based on the Houdayer cluster algorithm for two-dimensional spin glasses and lead to a speedup over conventional state-of-the-art methods that increases with the system size. We illustrate the benefits of the isoenergetic cluster moves in two and three space dimensions, as well as the nonplanar Chimera topology found in the D-Wave quantum annealing machine.

abstract: Under the normal assumptions of quantum field theory, Haag's theorem states that any field unitarily equivalent to a free field must itself be a free field. Unfortunately, the derivation of the Dyson series perturbation expansion relies on the use of the interaction picture, in which the interacting field is unitarily equivalent to the free field but must still account for interactions. Thus, the traditional perturbative derivation of the scattering matrix in quantum field theory is mathematically ill defined. Nevertheless, perturbative quantum field theory is currently the only practical approach for addressing scattering for realistic interactions, and it has been spectacularly successful in making empirical predictions. This paper explains this success by showing that quantum field theory can be formulated, using an invariant, fifth path parameter in addition to the usual four position parameters, in such a way that Haag's theorem no longer applies, but such that the Dyson perturbation expansion for the scattering matrix can still be reproduced, term by term. As a result, the parameterized formalism provides a consistent foundation for the interpretation of quantum field theory as used in practice and, perhaps, for better dealing with other mathematical issues, such as renormalization.

abstract: We experimentally observe many-body localization of interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasi-random optical lattice. We identify the many-body localization transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially-prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all remnants of the initial order. In contrast, above a critical disorder strength a significant portion of the initial ordering persists, thereby serving as an effective order parameter for localization. The stationary density wave order and the critical disorder value show a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, in agreement with numerical simulations. We connect this dependence to the ubiquitous logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy characterizing the generic many-body localized phase.

abstract: A numerically exact path integral treatment of the absorption and emission spectra of open quantum systems is presented that requires only the straightforward solution of a stochastic differential equation. The approach converges rapidly enabling the calculation of spectra of large excitonic systems across the complete range of system parameters and for arbitrary bath spectral densities. With the numerically exact absorption and emission operators one can also immediately compute energy transfer rates using the multi-chromophoric Forster resonant energy transfer formalism. Benchmark calculations on the emission spectra of two level systems are presented demonstrating the efficacy of the stochastic approach. This is followed by calculations of the energy transfer rates between two weakly coupled dimer systems as a function of temperature and system-bath coupling strength. It is shown that the recently developed hybrid cumulant expansion is the only perturbative method capable of generating uniformly reliable energy transfer rates and spectra across a broad range of system parameters.

abstract: The second-order temporal interference between two independent single-mode continuous-wave lasers is discussed by employing two-photon interference in Feynman's path integral theory. It is concluded that whether the second-order temporal interference pattern can be retrieved via two-photon coincidence counting measurement is dependent on the relationship between the resolution time of the detection system and the frequency difference between these two lasers. Two identical and tunable single-mode diode lasers are employed to verify the predictions experimentally. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical predictions. These studies are helpful to understand the physics of two-photon interference with photons of different spectrums and application of two-photon interference in quantum information processing.

abstract: Contrarily to a common belief, any beam of light possesses to a some extent the ability to "reconstruct itself" after hitting an obstacle. The celebrated Arago spot phenomenon is nothing but a manifestation of this property. In this work we analyze the self-healing mechanism from both a mathematical and a physical point of view, eventually finding a new expression for the minimum reconstruction distance, which is valid for \emph{any} kind of beam, including Gaussian ones. Finally, a witness function that quantify the self-reconstruction capability of a beam is proposed and tested. The results presented here help clarifying the physics underlying self-healing mechanism in optical beams.

abstract: Zero-to-ultra-low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF-NMR) provides a new regime for the measurement of nuclear spin-spin interactions free from effects of large magnetic fields, such as truncation of terms that do not commute with the Zeeman Hamiltonian. One such interaction, the magnetic dipole-dipole coupling, is a valuable source of spatial information in NMR, though many terms are unobservable in high-field NMR, and the interaction averages to zero under isotropic molecular tumbling. Under partial orientational ordering, this information is retained in the form of so-called residual dipolar couplings. We report zero-to-ultra-low-field NMR measurements of residual dipolar couplings in acetonitrile-2-$^{13}$C aligned in stretched polyvinyl acetate gels. This represents the first investigation of dipolar couplings as a perturbation on the indirect spin-spin $J$-coupling in the absence of an applied magnetic field. As a consequence of working at zero magnetic field, we observe terms of the dipole-dipole coupling Hamiltonian that are invisible in conventional high-field NMR. This technique expands the capabilities of zero-to-ultra-low-field NMR and may have applications in chemical analysis, precision measurement of subtle physical interactions, and characterization of local mesoscale structure in materials.

abstract: The local-field (LF) problem of a finite-size dipole emit- ter radiating inside a lossy inhomogeneous structure is a long-standing and challenging quantum optical problem, and it now is becoming more important due to rapid advances in solid-state fabrication technologies. Here we introduce a simple and accurate quasi-normal mode (QNM) technique to solve this problem analyti- cally by separating the scattering problem into contribu- tions from the QNM and an image dipole. Using a real- cavity model to describe an artificial atom inside a lossy and dispersive gold nanorod, we show when the contri- bution of the QNM to LFs will dominate over the homo- geneous contribution. We also show how to accurately describe surface scattering for real cavities that are close to the metal interface and explore regimes when the surface scattering dominates. Our results offer an intui- tive picture of the underlying physics for the LF problem and facilitate the understanding of novel photon sources within lossy structures.

abstract: We describe how the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique can be used to compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) for metallic nano-resonators, which is important for describing and understanding light-matter interactions in nanoplasmonics. We use the QNM to model the enhanced spontaneous emission rate for dipole emitters near a gold nanorod dimer structure using a newly developed QNM expansion technique. Significant enhanced photon emission factors of around 1500 are obtained with large output $\beta$-factors of about $60\%$.

abstract: The purpose of this work is to retrace the steps that were made by scientists of XIX century, like Bohr, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Dirac, for the formulation of what today represents the modern quantum mechanics and that, within two decades, put in question the classical physics. In this context, the study of the electronic structure of hydrogen atom has been the main starting point for the formulation of the theory and, till now, remains the only real case for which the quantum equation of motion can be solved exactly. The results obtained by each theory will be discussed critically, highlighting limits and potentials that allowed the further development of the quantum theory.

abstract: A homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with a positive cosmological constant is considered. The matter sector is given by a massless scalar field, which can be used as an internal time to deparametrize the theory. The idea is to study and compare the evolutions of a quantum and a classical probability distribution by performing a decomposition of both distributions in their corresponding moments. For the numerical analysis an initial peaked Gaussian state in the volume will be chosen. Furthermore, in order to check the robustness of certain results, as initial state both a slightly deformed Gaussian, as well as another completely different state, will also be studied. Differences and similarities between classical and quantum moments are pointed out. In particular, for a subset of moments classical and quantum evolutions are quite similar, but certain variables show remarkable differences.

abstract: We review different definitions of the current density for quantized fermions in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Several deficiencies in the popular prescription due to Schwinger and the mode sum formula for static external potentials are pointed out. We argue that Dirac's method, which is the analog of the Hadamard point-splitting employed in quantum field theory in curved space-times, is conceptually the most satisfactory. As a concrete example, we discuss vacuum polarization and the stress-energy tensor for massless fermions in 1+1 dimension. Also a general formula for the vacuum polarization in static external potentials in 3+1 dimensions is derived.

abstract: When a vortex beam with the spiral phase structure passes through a dynamic angular double slits (ADS), the interference pattern changes alternatively between destructive and constructive at the angular bisector direction of the ADS due to their phase difference. Based on this property, we experimentally demonstrate a simple method, which can precisely and efficiently determine the topological charge of vortex beams. What is more, this scheme allows determining both the modulus and sign of the topological charge of vortex beams simultaneously.

abstract: We study a family of frustrated anti-ferromagnetic spin-$S$ systems with a fully dimerized ground state. This state can be exactly obtained without the need to include any additional three-body interaction in the model. The simplest members of the family can be used as a building block to generate more complex geometries like spin tubes with a fully dimerized ground state. After present some numerical results about the phase diagram of these systems, we show that the ground state is robust against the inclusion of weak disorder in the couplings as well as several kinds of perturbations, allowing to study some other interesting models as a perturbative expansion of the exact one. A discussion on how to determine the dimerization region in terms of quantum information estimators is also presented. Finally, we explore the relation of these results with a the case of the a 4-leg spin tube which recently was proposed as the model for the description of the compound Cu$_2$Cl$_4$D$_8$C$_4$SO$_2$, delimiting the region of the parameter space where this model presents dimerization in its ground state.

abstract: Analytical expressions are derived for sums of matrix elements and their squared moduli over many-body states with given total spin --- the states built from spin and spatial wavefunctions belonging to multidimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group, unless the total spin has the maximal allowed value. For spin-dependent one-body interactions with external fields and spin-independent two-body ones between the particles, the sum dependence on the many-body states is given by universal factors, which are independent of the interaction details and Hamiltonians of non-interacting particles. The sum rules are applied to perturbative analysis of energy spectra.

abstract: I investigate entanglement entropy of one dimension (1D) cluster states to discuss the delocalization of clusters in linear-chain $3\alpha$- and $4\alpha$-cluster states. In analysis of entanglement entropy of 1D Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\"opke (THSR) and Brink-Bloch cluster wave functions, I show clear differences in the entanglement entropy between localized cluster wave functions and delocalized cluster wave functions. In order to clarify spatial regions where the entanglement entropy is generated by the delocalization of clusters, I analyze the spatial distribution of entanglement entropy. In the linear-chain $3\alpha$ cluster state, the delocalization occurs dominantly in a low-density tail region while it is relatively suppressed in an inner region because of Pauli blocking effect between clusters. In the linear-chain 4$\alpha$ state having a larger system size than the linear-chain $3\alpha$ state, the delocalization occurs in the whole system. The entanglement entropy is found to be a measure of the delocalization of clusters in the 1D cluster systems.

abstract: Heteronuclear alkali-metal dimers represent the class of molecules of choice for creating samples of ultracold molecules exhibiting an intrinsic large permanent electric dipole moment. Among them, the KCs molecule, with a permanent dipole moment of 1.92~Debye still remains to be observed in ultracold conditions. Based on spectroscopic studies available in the literature completed by accurate quantum chemistry calculations, we propose several optical coherent schemes to create ultracold bosonic and fermionic KCs molecules in their absolute rovibrational ground level, starting from a weakly bound level of their electronic ground state manifold. The processes rely on the existence of convenient electronically excited states allowing an efficient stimulated Raman adiabatic transfer of the level population.

abstract: We propose a method for implementation of an universal set of one- and two-quantum-bit gates for quantum computation in the system of two coupled electrons with constant non-diagonal exchange interaction. Suppression of the exchange interaction is offered to implement by all-the-time repetition of single spin rotations. Small g-factor difference of electrons allows to address qubits and to avoid strong magnetic field pulses. It is shown by means of numerical experiments that for implementation of one- and two-qubit operations it is sufficient to change the amplitude of the magnetic field within a few Gauss, introducing in a resonance one and then the other electron. To find the evolution of the two-qubit system, we use the algorithms of the optimal control theory.

While trajectories of Majorana stars of a filled Bloch band exhibit quite different geometrical structures for topologically trivial and nontrivial phases, we further demonstrate that these structures are uniquely determined by distributions of Majorana stars of two high-symmetrical momentum states, which have different parities for topologically different states.

abstract: Radiative emission during cold collisions between trapped laser-cooled Rb atoms and alkaline-earth ions (Ca$^+$, Sr$^+$, Ba$^+$) and Yb$^+$, and between Li and Yb$^+$, are studied theoretically, using accurate effective-core-potential based quantum chemistry calculations of potential energy curves and transition dipole moments of the related molecular ions. Radiative association of molecular ions is predicted to occur for all systems with a cross section two to ten times larger than the radiative charge transfer one. Partial and total rate constants are also calculated and compared to available experiments. Narrow shape resonances are expected, which could be detectable at low temperature with an experimental resolution at the limit of the present standards. Vibrational distributions are also calculated, showing that the final molecular ions are not created in their ground state level.

abstract: Optical clocks based on ensembles of trapped ions offer the perspective of record frequency uncertainty with good short-term stability. Most suitable atomic species lack closed transitions for fast detection such that the clock signal has to be read out indirectly through transferring the quantum state of clock ions to co-trapped logic ions by means of quantum logic operations. For ensembles of clock ions existing methods for quantum logic readout require a linear overhead in either time or the number of logic ions. Here we report a quantum algorithmic readout whose overhead scales logarithmically with the number of clock ions in both of these respects. We show that the readout algorithm can be implemented with a single application of a multi-species quantum gate, which we describe in detail for a crystal of Aluminum and Calcium ions.

Here, we determine the scalar and the spinor propagators under the same approximations, which are useful tools for calculating, e.g., total probabilities of processes occurring in such complex electromagnetic fields. In addition, we also present a simpler and more general expression of the electron wave functions found in [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{113}, 040402 (2014)] and we indicate a substitution rule to obtain them starting from the well-known Volkov wave functions in a plane-wave field.

abstract: We show that the quantum Jarzynski equality generalizes to $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics with unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. In the regime of broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry the Jarzynski equality does not hold as also the $\mathcal{CPT}$-norm is not preserved during the dynamics. These findings are illustrated for an experimentally relevant system -- two coupled optical waveguides. It turns out that for these systems the phase transition between the regimes of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is thermodynamically inhibited as the irreversible work diverges at the critical point.

abstract: Recently, Almheiri, Dong, and Harlow have argued that the localization of bulk information in a boundary dual should be understood in terms of quantum error correction. We show that this structure appears naturally when the gauge invariance of the boundary theory is incorporated. This provides a new understanding of the non-uniqueness of the bulk fields (precursors). It suggests a close connection between gauge invariance and the emergence of spacetime.

abstract: We calculated the von Neumann entanglement entropy and the Schmidt number of one dimentional (1D) cluster states and showed that these are useful measures to estimate entanglement caused by delocalization of clusters. We analyze system size dependence of these entanglement measures in the linear-chain $n\alpha$ states given by Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\"opke wave functions for 1D cluster gas states. We show that the Schmidt number is an almost equivalent measures to the von Neumann entanglement entropy when the delocalization of clusters occurs in the entire system but it shows different behaviors in a partially delocalized state containing localized clusters and delocalized ones. It means that the R\'enyi-2 entanglement entropy, which relates to the Schmidt number, is found to be almost equivalent to the von Neumann entanglement entropy for the full delocalized cluster system but it is less sensitive to the partially delocalized cluster system than the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We also propose a new entanglement measure which has a generalized form of the Schmidt number. Sensitivity of these measures of entanglement to the delocalization of clusters in low-density regions was discussed.

abstract: We simulate the long-range inter-complex electronic energy transfer in Photosystem II -- from the antenna complex, via a core complex, to the reaction center -- using a non-Markovian (ZOFE) quantum master equation description that allows us to quantify the electronic coherence involved in the energy transfer. We identify the pathways of the energy transfer in the network of coupled chromophores, using a description based on excitation probability currents. We investigate how the energy transfer depends on the initial excitation -- localized, coherent initial excitation versus delocalized, incoherent initial excitation -- and find that the energy transfer is remarkably robust with respect to such strong variations of the initial condition. To explore the importance of vibrationally enhanced transfer and to address the question of optimization in the system parameters, we vary the strength of the coupling between the electronic and the vibrational degrees of freedom. We find that the original parameters lie in a (broad) region that enables optimal transfer efficiency, and that the energy transfer appears to be very robust with respect to variations in the vibronic coupling. Nevertheless, vibrationally enhanced transfer appears to be crucial to obtain a high transfer efficiency. We compare our quantum simulation to a "classical" rate equation based on a modified-Redfield/generalized-F\"orster description that was previously used to simulate energy transfer dynamics in the entire Photosystem II complex, and find very good agreement between quantum and rate-equation simulation of the overall energy transfer dynamics.

abstract: Quantum metrology studies the ultimate limit of precision in estimating a physical quantity if quantum strategies are exploited. Here we investigate the evolution of a two-level atom as a detector which interacts with a massless scalar field using the master equation approach for open quantum system. We employ local quantum estimation theory to estimate the Unruh temperature when probed by a uniformly accelerated detector in the Minkowski vacuum. In particular, we evaluate the Fisher information (FI) for population measurement, maximize its value over all possible detector preparations and evolution times, and compare its behavior with that of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). We find that the optimal precision of estimation is achieved when the detector evolves for a long enough time. Furthermore, we find that in this case the FI for population measurement is independent of initial preparations of the detector and is exactly equal to the QFI, which means that population measurement is optimal. This result demonstrates that the achievement of the ultimate bound of precision imposed by quantum mechanics is possible. Finally, we note that the same configuration is also available to the maximum of the QFI itself.

abstract: We consider the interaction of a ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate with a magnetic field gradient. The magnetic field gradient realizes a spin-position coupling that explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry T and space parity P, but preserves the combined PT symmetry. We observe using numerical simulations, a first-order phase transition spontaneously breaking this re-maining symmetry. The transition to a low-gradient phase, in which gradient effects are frozen out by the ferromagnetic interaction, suggests the possibility of high-coherence magnetic sensors unaffected by gradient dephasing.

abstract: Relevant contributions by Majorana regarding Compton scattering off free or bound electrons are considered in detail, where a (full quantum) generalization of the Kramers-Heisenberg dispersion formula is derived. The role of intermediate electronic states is appropriately pointed out in recovering the standard Klein-Nishina formula (for free electron scattering) by making recourse to a limpid physical scheme alternative to the (then unknown) Feynman diagram approach. For bound electron scattering, a quantitative description of the broadening of the Compton line was obtained for the first time by introducing a finite mean life for the excited state of the electron system. Finally, a generalization aimed to describe Compton scattering assisted by a non-vanishing applied magnetic field is as well considered, revealing its relevance for present day research.

abstract: We explore the role of entanglement in adiabatic quantum optimization by performing approximate simulations of the real-time evolution of a quantum system while limiting the amount of entanglement. To classically simulate the time evolution of the system with a limited amount of entanglement, we represent the quantum state using matrix-product states and projected entangled-pair states. We show that the probability of finding the ground state of an Ising spin glass on either a planar or non-planar two-dimensional graph increases rapidly as the amount of entanglement in the state is increased. Furthermore, we propose evolution in complex time as a way to improve simulated adiabatic evolution and mimic the effects of thermal cooling of the quantum annealer.

abstract: In the presence of interactions with the environment, decoherence selects stable classical states, the pointer states, while suppressing arbitrary macroscopic coherent superpositions. In close analogy, the metastable symmetry-breaking ground states of many-body Hamiltonians should be the ones with the least macroscopic entanglement and thus the most classical ones among all possible quantum ground states. By considering the mutual information based on the 2-Renyi entanglement entropy and using a locality result, we show that symmetry-breaking states have the least macroscopic entanglement and, consequently, that they are the ones selected in real world by environmental decoherence.

abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamical properties of a weakly-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature under the multi-pulsed quantum quench in interaction by calculating one-body, two-body correlation functions and Tan's contact of the model system. The multi-pulsed quench is represented as follows: first suddenly quenching the interatomic interaction from $g_{i}$ to $g_{f}$ at time $t=0$, holding time $t$, and then suddenly quenching interaction from $g_{f}$ back to $g_{i}$, holding the time $t$ sequence $n$ times. In particular, two typical kinds of quenching parameters are chosen, corresponding to $(g_{i}/g_{f}>1)$ and $(g_{i}/g_{f}<1)$ respectively. We find that the more the quenching times of $n$ are, the more the excitations are excited, which suggests that the multi-pulsed QQ is more powerful way of studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum system than the `one-off' quantum quench. Finally, we discuss the ultra-short-range properties of the two-body correlation function after the $n$th quenching, which can be used to probe the `Tan'scontact' in experiments. All our calculations can be tested in current cold atom experiments.

We generalize the idea to another topological number, the Z$_2$ Berry phase for a system with particle-hole symmetry, and apply it to a groundstate in a weak topological phase where the Chern number vanishes but the groundstate nevertheless has edge states. This entanglement Berry phase is especially useful for characterizing random systems with nontrivial edge states.

Using the spectral entropy as an indicator of chaos and three different numerical approaches : Exact diagonalization, truncated Husimi method and mean-field (Gross-Pitaevskii) approximation, we put into evidence the destructive impact of quantum noise on the emergence of the nonlinear dynamics.

abstract: Diagrammatic techniques for reasoning about monoidal categories provide an intuitive understanding of the symmetries and connections of interacting computational processes. In the context of categorical quantum mechanics, Coecke and Kissinger suggested that two 3-qubit states, GHZ and W, may be used as the building blocks of a new graphical calculus, aimed at a diagrammatic classification of multipartite qubit entanglement that would highlight the communicational properties of quantum states, and their potential uses in cryptographic schemes. In this paper, we present a full graphical axiomatisation of the relations between GHZ and W: the ZW calculus. This refines a version of the preexisting ZX calculus, while keeping its most desirable characteristics: undirectedness, a large degree of symmetry, and an algebraic underpinning. We prove that the ZW calculus is complete for the category of free abelian groups on a power of two generators - "qubits with integer coefficients" - and provide an explicit normalisation procedure.

abstract: The dissipative Dicke model exhibits a fascinating out-of-equilibrium many-body phase transition as a function of a coupling between a driven photonic cavity and numerous two-level atoms. We study the effect of a time-dependent parametric modulation of this coupling, and discover a rich phase diagram as a function of the modulation strength. We find that in addition to the established normal and super-radiant phases, a new phase with pulsed superradiance which we term dynamical normal phase appears when the system is parametrically driven. Employing different methods, we characterize the different phases and the transitions between them. Specific heed is paid to the role of dissipation in determining the phase boundaries. Our analysis paves the road for the experimental study of dynamically stabilized phases of interacting light and matter.

abstract: This paper is devoted to the theory of quantum electromagnetic field in an optically dense medium. Self-consistent equations describing interaction between a quantum field and a quantum dielectric medium are obtained from the first principles, i.e., outside a phenomenological description. Using these equations, we found a transformation (of the Bogoliubov transformation type) that converts the operators of the "vacuum" field into operators of collective perturbations of the field and an ensemble of atoms, that is, photons in the medium. Transformation parameter is the refractive index of the wave mode considered. It is shown that besides the energy of the collective electromagnetic field, the energy of photons in the medium includes the energy of the internal degrees of freedom of the substance and the energy of near-field dipole interaction between atoms in the polarized medium. The concept of negative energy photons is introduced on the basis of self-consistent equations.

abstract: We review in this article the role which the work of Pauli and Weisskopf played in formulating a quantum field theory of spinless particles. To make our computations as transparent as possible, we offer a physicist's derivation of the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation. Since invariant functions play a significant part in our paper, we will discuss them in great detail. We emphasize Pauli's and Weisskopf's view that Dirac's hole theory is totally obsolete in formulating a consistent quantum field theory, be it for scalar or spinor particles. As an important example we present the calculation for producing charged scalar particles in an external electric field.

abstract: We study the non-equilibrium steady state arising from the interplay between coherent and dissipative dynamics in strongly interacting Rydberg gases using a recently introduced variational method [H. Weimer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 040402 (2015)]. We give a detailed discussion of the properties of this novel approach, and we provide a comparison with methods related to the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy. We find that the variational approach offers some intrinsic advantages, and we also show that it is able to explain the experimental results obtained in an ultracold Rydberg gas on an unprecedented quantitative level.

abstract: We consider the gravitational correction to (electronic) vacuum polarization in the presence of a gravitational background field. The Dirac propagators for the virtual fermions are modified to include the leading gravitational correction (potential term) which corresponds to a coordinate-dependent fermion mass. The mass term is assumed to be uniform over a length scale commensurate with the virtual electron-positron pair. The on-mass shell renormalization condition ensures that the gravitational correction vanishes on the mass shell of the photon, i.e., the speed of light is unaffected by the quantum field theoretical loop correction, in full agreement with the equivalence principle. Nontrivial corrections are obtained for off-shell, virtual photons. We compare our findings to other works on generalized Lorentz transformations and combined quantum-electrodynamic gravitational corrections to the speed of light which have recently appeared in the literature.

abstract: A comparative study is undertaken that brings to light the two different methods of how to treat the many-body problem in quantum field theory. The two main researchers who published the first versions of how to quantize a many-body assembly were P. Jordan and P.A.M. Dirac. What they understood by the so-called "second quantization" will be the subject of the paper. We will argue that it is Jordan's field operator approach that until now constitutes the basis of any work in quantum field theory.

abstract: We propose a method of measuring topological invariants of a photonic crystal through phase spectroscopy. We show how the Chern numbers can be deduced from the winding numbers of the reflection coefficient phase. An explicit proof of existence of edge states in system with nonzero reflection phase winding number is given. The method is illustrated for one- and two-dimensional photonic crystals of nontrivial topology.

abstract: We develop a method of constructing excited states in one dimensional spin chains which are derived from the $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten Conformal Field Theory (CFT) using a parent Hamiltonian approach. The resulting systems are equivalent to the Haldane-Shastry model. In our ansatz, correlation functions between primary fields correspond to the ground state of the spin system, whereas excited states are obtained by insertion of descendant fields. Our construction is based on the current algebra of the CFT and emphasizes the close relation between the spectrum of the spin system and the underlying CFT. This general structure might imply that the method could be applied to a wider range of model systems.

abstract: We study novel type of contributions to the partition function of the Maxwell system defined on a small compact manifold ${\mathbb{M}}$ such as torus. These new terms can not be described in terms of the physical propagating photons with two transverse polarizations. Rather, these novel contributions emerge as a result of tunnelling events when transitions occur between topologically different but physically identical vacuum winding states. These new terms give an extra contribution to the Casimir pressure, yet to be measured. We argue that if the same system is considered in the background of a small external time-dependent magnetic field, than there will be emission of photons from the vacuum, similar to the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) when real particles are radiated from the vacuum due to the time-dependent boundary conditions. The difference with conventional DCE is that the dynamics of the vacuum in our system is not related to the fluctuations of the conventional degrees of freedom, the virtual photons. Rather, the radiation in our case occurs as a result of tunnelling events between topologically different but physically identical $|k>$ sectors in a time -dependent background. We comment on relation of this novel effect with the well-known, experimentally observed, and theoretically understood phenomena of the persistent currents in normal metal rings. We also comment on possible cosmological applications of this effect.

abstract: Weyl semimetals are a class of topological materials that exhibit a bulk Hall effect due to time-reversal symmetry breaking. We show that for the idealized semi-infinite case, the Casimir force between two identical Weyl semimetals is repulsive at short range and attractive at long range. Considering plates of finite thickness, we can reduce the size of the long-range attraction even making it repulsive for all distances when thin enough. In the thin film limit, we study the appearance of an attractive Casimir force at shorter distances due to the longitudinal conductivity. Magnetic field, thickness, and chemical potential provide tunable nobs for this effect, controlling the Casimir force: whether it is attractive or repulsive, the magnitude of the effect, and the positions and existence of a trap and antitrap.

abstract: We calculate the quantum states of regular polygons made of 1D quantum wires treating each polygon vertex as a scatterer. The vertex scattering matrix is analytically obtained from the model of a circular bend of a given angle of a 2D nanowire. In the single mode limit the spectrum is classified in doublets of vanishing circulation, twofold split by the small vertex reflection, and singlets with circulation degeneracy. Simple analytic expressions of the energy eigenvalues are given. It is shown how each polygon is characterized by a specific spectrum.

abstract: We derive the polarization tensor of graphene at nonzero temperature in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. The obtained tensor coincides with the previously known one at all Matsubara frequencies, but, in contrast to it, admits analytic continuation to the real frequency axis satisfying all physical requirements. Using the obtained representation for the polarization tensor, we develope quantum field theoretical description for the reflectivity of graphene. The analytic asymptotic expressions for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities at low and high frequencies are derived for both independent polarizations of the electromagnetic field. The dependencies of reflectivities on the frequency and angle of incidence are investigated. Numerical computations using the exact expressions for the polarization tensor are performed and application regions for the analytic asymptotic results are determined.

abstract: We study the electron transport in open quantum-dot systems described by the interacting resonant-level models with Coulomb interactions. We consider the situation in which the quantum dot is connected to the left and right leads asymmetrically. We exactly construct many-electron scattering eigenstates for the two-lead system, where two-body bound states appear as a consequence of one-body resonances and the Coulomb interactions. By using an extension of the Landauer formula, we calculate the average electric current for the system under bias voltages in the first order of the interaction parameters. Through a renormalization-group technique, we arrive at the universal electric current, where we observe the suppression of the electric current for large bias voltages, i.e., negative differential conductance. We find that the suppressed electric current is restored by the asymmetry of the system parameters.

After carefully defining the measurement set up we will check the validity of our results in the case of Klein-Gordon field theory (coupled harmonic oscillators) and spin-$1/2$ XX chain in a magnetic field. The agreement between analytical results and the numerical calculations is very good.

abstract: Controlling single-particle wave functions in single semiconductor quantum dots is in demand to implement solid-state quantum information processing and spintronics. Normally, particle wave functions can be tuned transversely by an perpendicular magnetic field. We report a longitudinal wave function control in single quantum dots with a magnetic field. For a pure InAs quantum dot with a shape of pyramid or truncated pyramid, the hole wave function always occupies the base because of the less confinement at base, which induces a permanent dipole oriented from base to apex. With applying magnetic field along the base-apex direction, the hole wave function shrinks in the base plane. Because of the linear changing of the confinement for hole wave function from base to apex, the center of effective mass moves up during shrinking process. Due to the uniform confine potential for electrons, the center of effective mass of electrons does not move much, which results in a permanent dipole moment change and an inverted electron-hole alignment along the magnetic field direction. Manipulating the wave function longitudinally not only provides an alternative way to control the charge distribution with magnetic field but also a new method to tune electron-hole interaction in single quantum dots.

abstract: Recent work has proposed that the interaction between ordinary matter and a stochastic gravitational background can lead to the decoherence of large aggregates of ordinary matter. In this work we point out that these arguments can be carried over to a stochastic neutrino background but with the Planck scale of the gravitational decoherence replaced by the weak scale. This implies that it might be possible to observe such neutrino induced decoherence on a small, microscopic system rather than a macroscopic system as is the case for gravitationally induced decoherence. In particular we suggest that neutrino decoherence could be linked with observed variations in the decay rates of certain nuclei. Finally we point out that this proposed neutrino induced decoherence can be considered the complement of the Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect.
