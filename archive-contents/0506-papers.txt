title: New binding-concealing trade-offs for quantum string commitment

abstract: String commitment schemes are similar to the well studied bit commitment schemes in cryptography with the difference that the committing party, say Alice, is supposed to commit a long string instead of a single bit, to another party say Bob. Similar to bit commitment schemes, such schemes are supposed to be binding, i.e Alice cannot change her choice after committing, and concealing i.e. Bob cannot find Alice's committed string before Alice reveals it. Ideal commitment schemes are known to be impossible. Even if some degrees of cheating is allowed, Buhrman, Christandl, Hayden, Lo and Wehner (quant-ph/0504078) have recently shown that there are some binding-concealing trade-offs that any quantum string commitment scheme (QSC) must follow. They showed trade-offs both in the scenario of single execution of the protocol and in the asymptotic regime of sufficiently large number of parallel executions of the protocol. We present here new trade-offs in the scenario of single execution of a QSC protocol. Our trade-offs also immediately imply the trade-off shown by Buhrman et al. in the asymptotic regime. We show our results by making a central use of an important information theoretic tool called the substate theorem due to Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen. Our techniques are quite different from that of Buhrman et al. and may be of independent interest.

abstract: Since quantum feedback is based on classically accessible measurement results, it can provide fundamental insights into the dynamics of quantum systems by making available classical information on the evolution of system properties and on the conditional forces acting on the system. In this paper, the feedback-induced interaction dynamics between a pair of quantum systems is analyzed. It is pointed out that any interaction Hamiltonian can be simulated by local feedback if the levels of decoherence are sufficiently high. The boundary between genuine entanglement generating quantum interactions and non-entangling classical interactions is identified and the nature of the information exchange between two quantum systems during an interaction is discussed.

abstract: he Casimir force is calculated between plates with thin metallic coating. Thin films are described with spatially dispersive (nonlocal) dielectric functions. For thin films the nonlocal effects are more relevant than for half-spaces. However, it is shown that even for film thickness smaller than the mean free path for electrons, the difference between local and nonlocal calculations of the Casimir force is of the order of a few tenths of a percent. Thus the local description of thin metallic films is adequate within the current experimental precision and range of separations.

The mode splitting in transmission spectra of phase-sensitive optical parametric amplifier is observed. Especially, we show a very narrow dip and peak, which are the shape of $\delta $ function, appear in the transmission profile. The origin of the coherence phenomenon in this system is the interference between the harmonic pump field and the subharmonic seed field in cooperation with dissipation of the cavity.

abstract: The same set of physically motivated axioms can be used to construct both the classical ensemble Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Schrodingers equation. Crucial roles are played by the assumptions of universality and simplicity (Occam's Razor) which restrict the number and type of of arbitrary constants that appear in the equations of motion. In this approach, non-relativistic quantum theory is seen as the unique single parameter extension of the classical ensemble dynamics. The method is contrasted with other related constructions in the literature and some consequences of relaxing the axioms are also discussed: for example, the appearance of nonlinear higher-derivative corrections possibly related to gravity and spacetime fluctuations. Finally, some open research problems within this approach are highlighted.

abstract: Here we describe a simple mechanical procedure for compiling a quantum gate network into the natural gates (pulses and delays) for an Ising quantum computer. The aim is not necessarily to generate the most efficient pulse sequence, but rather to develop an efficient compilation algorithm that can be easily implemented in large spin systems. The key observation is that it is not always necessary to refocus all the undesired couplings in a spin system. Instead the coupling evolution can simply be tracked and then corrected at some later time. Although described within the language of NMR the algorithm is applicable to any design of quantum computer based on Ising couplings.

abstract: Quantization of a damped harmonic oscillator leads to so called Bateman's dual system. The corresponding Bateman's Hamiltonian, being a self-adjoint operator, displays the discrete family of complex eigenvalues. We show that they correspond to the poles of energy eigenvectors and the corresponding resolvent operator when continued to the complex energy plane. Therefore, the corresponding generalized eigenvectors may be interpreted as resonant states which are responsible for the irreversible quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator.

abstract: The resonant interaction of two nonidentical two-level atoms with one mode of the electromagnetic field has been considered. The pure-state evolution of the atomic states for field initially in the coherent state and atoms in the ground state has been investigated. It has been shown that for intermediate values of the relative differences of two coupling constants the atoms as well as the field are returned most closely to a pure state at the revival time. The possibility of the maximally entangled states at the beginning of the collapse time has been discussed.

abstract: In this theoretical paper, we investigate coherence properties of the near-resonant light scattered by two atoms exposed to a strong monochromatic field. To properly incorporate saturation effects, we use a quantum Langevin approach. In contrast to the standard optical Bloch equations, this method naturally provides the inelastic spectrum of the radiated light induced by the quantum electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. However, to get the right spectral properties of the scattered light, it is essential to correctly describe the statistical properties of these vacuum fluctuations. Because of the presence of the two atoms, these statistical properties are not Gaussian : (i) the spatial two-points correlation function displays a speckle-like behavior and (ii) the three-points correlation function does not vanish. We also explain how to incorporate in a simple way propagation with a frequency-dependent scattering mean-free path, meaning that the two atoms are embedded in an average scattering dispersive medium. Finally we show that saturation-induced nonlinearities strongly modify the atomic scattering properties and, as a consequence, provide a source of decoherence in multiple scattering. This is exemplified by considering the coherent backscattering configuration where interference effects are blurred by this decoherence mechanism. This leads to a decrease of the so-called coherent backscattering enhancement factor.

abstract: We propose a novel method to generate non-classical states of a single-mode microwave field, and to produce macroscopic cat states by virtue of a three-level system with $\Delta$-shaped (or cyclic) transitions. This exotic system can be implemented by a superconducting quantum circuit with a broken symmetry in its effective potential. Using the cyclic population transfer, controllable single-mode photon states can be created in the third transition when two classical fields are applied to induce the other two transitions. This is because, for large detuning, two classical fields are equivalent to an effective external force, which derives the quantized single mode. Our approach is valid not only for superconducting quantum circuits but also for any three-level quantum system with $\Delta$-shaped transitions

abstract: This paper considers the realizability of quantum gates from the perspective of information complexity. Since the gate is a physical device that must be controlled classically, it is subject to random error. We define the complexity of gate operation in terms of the difference between the entropy of the variables associated with initial and final states of the computation. We argue that the gate operations are irreversible if there is a difference in the accuracy associated with input and output variables. It is shown that under some conditions the gate operation may be associated with unbounded entropy, implying impossibility of implementation.

abstract: We propose a method for reconstruction of the optical potential from scattering data. The algorithm is a two-step procedure. In the first step the real part of the potential is determined analytically via solution of the Marchenko equation. At this point we use a diagonal Pad\'{e} approximant of the corresponding unitary $S$-matrix. In the second step the imaginary part of the potential is determined via the phase equation of the variable phase approach. We assume that the real and the imaginary parts of the optical potential are proportional. We use the phase equation to calculate the proportionality coefficient. A numerical algorithm is developed for a single and for coupled partial waves. The developed procedure is applied to analysis of $^{1}S_{0}$ $NN$, $^{3}SD_{1}$ $NN$, $P31$ $\pi^{-} N$ and $S01$ $K^{+}N$ data.

abstract: We propose a method to create superpositions of two macroscopic quantum states of a single-mode microwave cavity field interacting with a superconducting charge qubit. The decoherence of such superpositions can be determined by measuring either the Wigner function of the cavity field or the charge qubit states. Then the quality factor Q of the cavity can be inferred from the decoherence of the superposed states. The proposed method is experimentally realizable within current technology even when the $Q$ value is relatively low, and the interaction between the qubit and the cavity field is weak.

The resulting quantum Bellman equation is then applied to the explicitly solvable quantum linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problem which emphasizes many similarities with the corresponding classical control problem.

abstract: Let G=(V,E) be a finite graph, and f:V->N be any function. The Local Search problem consists in finding a local minimum of the function f on G, that is a vertex v such that f(v) is not larger than the value of f on the neighbors of v in G. In this note, we first prove a separation theorem slightly stronger than the one of Gilbert, Hutchinson and Tarjan for graphs of constant genus. This result allows us to enhance a previously known deterministic algorithm for Local Search with query complexity O(\log n)\cdot d+O(\sqrt{g})\cdot\sqrt{n}, so that we obtain a deterministic query complexity of d+O(\sqrt{g})\cdot\sqrt{n}, where n is the size of G, d is its maximum degree, and $g$ is its genus. We also give a quantum version of our algorithm, whose query complexity is of O(\sqrt{d})+O(\sqrt[4]{g})\cdot\sqrt[4]{n}\log\log n. Our deterministic and quantum algorithms have query complexities respectively smaller than the generic algorithms of Aldous and of Aaronson for large classes of graphs, including graphs of bounded genus and planar graphs. Independently from this work, Zhang has recently given a quantum algorithm which finds a local minimum on the planar grid over \{1,...,\sqrt{n}\}^2 using O(\sqrt[4]{n}(\log\log n)^2) queries. Our quantum algorithm can be viewed as a strongly generalized, and slightly enhanced version of this algorithm.

abstract: We discuss the structure of decoherence-free subsystems for a bosonic channel affected by collective depolarization. A single use of the channel is defined as a transmission of a pair of bosonic modes. Collective depolarization consists in a random linear U(2) transformation of the respective mode operators, which is assumed to be identical for $N$ consecutive uses of the channel. We derive a recursion formula that characterizes the dimensionality of available decoherence-free subsystems in such a setting.

abstract: The linearity of quantum operations puts many fundamental constraints on the information processing tasks we can achieve on a quantum system whose state is not exactly known, just as we observe in quantum cloning and quantum discrimination. In this paper we show that in probabilistic manner, linearity is in fact the only one that restricts the physically realizable tasks. To be specific, if a system is prepared in a state secretly chosen from a linearly independent pure state set, then any quantum state separation can be physically realized with a positive probability. Furthermore, we derive a lower bound on the average failure probability of any quantum state separation.

We determine the Entanglement of Formation (EoF) as a function of the interaction strength, calculate the maximum EoF in each case and compare these values with the bounds found in \cite{wolf} which are valid for any quadratic hamiltonian.

abstract: The most general method for encoding quantum information is not to encode the information into a subspace of a Hilbert space, but to encode information into a subsystem of a Hilbert space. Recently this notion has led to a more general notion of quantum error correction known as operator quantum error correction. In standard quantum error correcting codes, one requires the ability to apply a procedure which exactly reverses on the error correcting subspace any correctable error. In contrast, for operator error correcting subsystems, the correction procedure need not undo the error which has occurred, but instead one must perform correction only modulo the subsystem structure. This does not lead to codes which differ from subspace codes, but does lead to recovery routines which explicitly make use of the subsystem structure. Here we present two examples of such operator error correcting subsystems. These examples are motivated by simple spatially local Hamiltonians on square and cubic lattices. In three dimensions we provide evidence, in the form a simple mean field theory, that our Hamiltonian gives rise to a system which is self-correcting. Such a system will be a natural high-temperature quantum memory, robust to noise without external intervening quantum error correction procedures.

abstract: This is a challenging paper including some review and new results. Since the non-commutative version of the classical system based on the compact group SU(2) has been constructed in (quant-ph/0502174) by making use of Jaynes-Commings model and so-called Quantum Diagonalization Method in (quant-ph/0502147), we construct a non-commutative version of the classical system based on the non-compact group SU(1,1) by modifying the compact case. In this model the Hamiltonian is not hermite but pseudo hermite, which causes a big difference between two models. For example, in the classical representation theory of SU(1,1), unitary representations are infinite dimensional from the starting point. Therefore, to develop a unitary theory of non-commutative system of SU(1,1) we need an infinite number of non-commutative systems, which means a kind of {\bf second non-commutativization}. This is a very hard and interesting problem. We develop a corresponding theory though it is not always enough, and present some challenging problems concerning how classical properties can be extended to the non-commutative case. This paper is arranged for the convenience of readers as the first subsection is based on the standard model (SU(2) system) and the next one is based on the non-standard model (SU(1,1) system). This contrast may make the similarity and difference between the standard and non-standard models clear.

This leads to a unique solution to the paradox where one could kill one's grandfather in that once the future has unfolded, it cannot change the past, and so the past becomes deterministic. On the other hand, looking forwards towards the future is completely probabilistic. This resolves the classical paradox in a philosophically satisfying manner.

For this purpose the moments of the creation and annihilation operators, of two quadratures, and of a quadrature and the photon number operator turn out to be useful. It is shown that all the required moments can be determined by homodyne correlation measurements. An example of a nonclassical effect that is easily characterized by our methods is amplitude-squared squeezing.

This equation has broad validity and allows us to identify novel regimes where the motion can be efficiently cooled to the potential ground state. Our result shows that the motion is critically affected by quantum correlations induced by the mechanical coupling with the resonator, which may lead to selective suppression of certain transitions for the appropriate parameters regimes, thereby increasing the cooling efficiency.

Lett. {\bf 87}, 247902 (2001)] for which we discuss the effects of various errors, and present means of error protection.

abstract: The debate on the nature of quantum probabilities in relation to Quantum Non Locality has elevated Quantum Mechanics to the level of an "Operational Epistemic Theory". In such context the quantum superposition principle has an extraneous non epistemic nature. This leads us to seek purely operational foundations for Quantum Mechanics, from which to derive the current mathematical axiomatization based on Hilbert spaces. In the present work I present a set of axioms of purely operational nature, based on a general definition of "the experiment", the operational/epistemic archetype of information retrieval from reality. As we will see, this starting point logically entails a series of notions [state, conditional state, local state, pure state, faithful state, instrument, propensity (i.e. "effect"), dynamical and informational equivalence, dynamical and informational compatibility, predictability, discriminability, programmability, locality, a-causality, rank of the state, maximally chaotic state, maximally entangled state, informationally complete propensity, etc. ], along with a set of rules (addition, convex combination, partial orderings, ...), which, far from being of quantum origin as often considered, instead constitute the universal "syntactic manual" of the operational/epistemic approach. The missing ingredient is, of course, the quantum superposition axiom for probability amplitudes: for this I propose some substitute candidates of purely operational/epistemic nature.

abstract: We compare the performance of various quantum key distribution (QKD) systems using a novel single-photon detector, which combines frequency up-conversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide and a silicon avalanche photodiode (APD). The comparison is based on the secure communication rate as a function of distance for three QKD protocols: the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84), the Bennett, Brassard, and Mermin 1992 (BBM92), and the coherent differential phase shift keying (DPSK). We show that the up-conversion detector allows for higher communication rates and longer communication distances than the commonly used InGaAs/InP APD for all the three QKD protocols.

abstract: The stabilizing properties of one-error correcting jump codes are explored under realistic non-ideal conditions. For this purpose the quantum algorithm of the tent-map is decomposed into a universal set of Hamiltonian quantum gates which ensure perfect correction of spontaneous decay processes under ideal circumstances even if they occur during a gate operation. An entanglement gate is presented which is capable of entangling any two logical qubits of different one-error correcting code spaces. With the help of this gate simultaneous spontaneous decay processes affecting physical qubits of different code spaces can be corrected and decoherence can be suppressed significantly.

As a first application the stabilization of a quantum memory is discussed which is perturbed by one-and two-qubit interactions.

abstract: We consider communication between two parties using a bipartite quantum operation, which constitutes the most general quantum mechanical model of two-party communication. We primarily focus on the simultaneous forward and backward communication of classical messages. For the case in which the two parties share unlimited prior entanglement, we give inner and outer bounds on the achievable rate region that generalize classical results due to Shannon. In particular, using a protocol of Bennett, Harrow, Leung, and Smolin, we give a one-shot expression in terms of the Holevo information for the entanglement-assisted one-way capacity of a two-way quantum channel. As applications, we rederive two known additivity results for one-way channel capacities: the entanglement-assisted capacity of a general one-way channel, and the unassisted capacity of an entanglement-breaking one-way channel.

The significance of this equivalence is interpreted in light of the theory of generic filters and boolean-valued models in set theory (the method of forcing). The apparent stochastic nature of quantum observation is derived for these hidden-variables models.

abstract: Fermionic (atomic nuclei) and bosonic (correlated atoms in a trap) systems are studied from an information-theoretic point of view. Shannon and Onicescu information measures are calculated for the above systems comparing correlated and uncorrelated cases as functions of the strength of short range correlations. One-body and two-body density and momentum distributions are employed. Thus the effect of short-range correlations on the information content is evaluated. The magnitude of distinguishability of the correlated and uncorrelated densities is also discussed employing suitable measures of distance of states i.e. the well known Kullback-Leibler relative entropy and the recently proposed Jensen-Shannon divergence entropy. It is seen that the same information-theoretic properties hold for quantum many-body systems obeying different statistics (fermions and bosons).

In other words, the algorithm checks whether a given PT-symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. The procedure neither requires to calculate any single eigenvalue nor any numerical approximation.

Using the non-Markovian ITM method we correct the decoherence time predicted by Bloch equations method. By comparing the exact theoretical result with the experimental data we suggest that the Ohmic noise plays the central role to the decoherence of the JCQ.

abstract: A concept of the generalized quantum measurement is introduced as the transformation, which establishes a correspondence between the initial states of the object system and final states of the object--measuring device (meter) system with the help of a classical informational index, unambiguously linked to the classically compatible set of states of the object--meter system. It is shown that the generalized measurement covers all the key known quantum measurement concepts--standard projective, entangling, fuzzy and the generalized measurement with the partial or complete destruction of the initial information contained in the object. A special class of partially-destructive measurements that map the continual set of the states in finite-dimensional quantum systems to that one of the infinite-dimensional quantum systems is considered. Their informational essence and some information characteristics are discussed in detail.

abstract: It has been claimed in the literature that impossibility of faster-than-light quantum communication has an origin of indistinguishability of ensembles with the same density matrix. We show that the two concepts are not related. We argue that: 1) even with an ideal single-atom-precision measurement, it is generally impossible to produce two ensembles with exactly the same density matrix; or 2) to produce ensembles with the same density matrix, classical communication is necessary. Hence the impossibility of faster-than-light communication does not imply the indistinguishability of ensembles with the same density matrix.

We obtain uniformly convergent asymptotics for the "exponential decay'' regions at the leading edges of the main peaks in the Schr{\"o}dinger (or wave-mechanics) picture. This calculation required us to generalise the method of stationary phase and we describe this extension in some detail, including self-contained proofs of all the technical lemmas required. We also rigorously establish the exact Feynman equivalence between the path-integral and wave-mechanics representations for this system using some techniques from the theory of special functions. Taken together with the previous work, we can now prove every theorem by both routes.

abstract: Quantum entanglement of pure states of a bipartite system is defined as the amount of local or marginal ({\em i.e.}referring to the subsystems) entropy. For mixed states this identification vanishes, since the global loss of information about the state makes it impossible to distinguish between quantum and classical correlations. Here we show how the joint knowledge of the global and marginal degrees of information of a quantum state, quantified by the purities or in general by information entropies, provides an accurate characterization of its entanglement. In particular, for Gaussian states of continuous variable systems, we classify the entanglement of two--mode states according to their degree of total and partial mixedness, comparing the different roles played by the purity and the generalized $p-$entropies in quantifying the mixedness and bounding the entanglement. We prove the existence of strict upper and lower bounds on the entanglement and the existence of extremally (maximally and minimally) entangled states at fixed global and marginal degrees of information. This results allow for a powerful, operative method to measure mixed-state entanglement without the full tomographic reconstruction of the state. Finally, we briefly discuss the ongoing extension of our analysis to the quantification of multipartite entanglement in highly symmetric Gaussian states of arbitrary $1 \times N$-mode partitions.

abstract: The rates at which classical and quantum information can be simultaneously transmitted from two spatially separated senders to a single receiver over an arbitrary quantum channel are characterized. Two main results are proved in detail. The first describes the region of rates at which one sender can send classical information while the other sends quantum information. The second describes those rates at which both senders can send quantum information. For each of these situations, an example of a channel is given for which the associated region admits a single-letter description. This is the author's Ph.D. dissertation, submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University in March, 2005. It represents an expanded version of the paper quant-ph/0501045, containing a number of tutorial chapters which may be of independent interest for those learning about quantum Shannon theory.

abstract: In the consistent histories formalism one specifies a family of histories as an exhaustive set of pairwise exclusive descriptions of the dynamics of a quantum system. We define branching families of histories, which strike a middle ground between the two available mathematically precise definitions of families of histories, viz., product families and Isham's history projector operator formalism. The former are too narrow for applications, and the latter's generality comes at a certain cost, barring an intuitive reading of the ``histories''. Branching families retain the intuitiveness of product families, they allow for the interpretation of a history's weight as a probability, and they allow one to distinguish two kinds of coarse-graining, leading to reconsidering the motivation for the consistency condition.

abstract: It is known that the additivity conjecture of Holevo capacity, output minimum entoropy, and the entanglement of formation (EoF), are equivalent with each other. Among them, the output minimum entropy is simplest, and hence many researchers are focusing on this quantity. Here, we suggest yet another entanglement measure, whose strong superadditivity and additivity are equivalent to the additivity of the quantities mentioned above. This quantity is as simple as the output minimum entropy, and in existing proofs of additivity conjecture of the output minimum entropy for the specific examples, they are essentially proving the strong superadditivity of this quantity.

In this way, we show that a finite central disordered region can lead to sustained superballistic growth in the second order spatial moment of entanglement within the chain.

Furthermore, we classify encoding operators into the equivalence classes such that EDPs (Entanglement Distillation Protocol) constructed from encoding operators in the same equivalence class have the same performance. By this classification, for a given parameter, the number of candidates for good EDPs is significantly reduced. As a result, we find the best EDP among EDPs constructed from [[4,2]] stabilizer codes. This EDP has a better performance than previously known EDPs over wide range of fidelity.

In fact, the exact version of the acceleration theorem should contain a phase factor depending on both the time and crystal momentum variables. As we show this phase factor plays an essential role in order to understand the motion of Bloch Oscillators in the position variable.

abstract: We investigate the detection and characterization of entanglement based on the quantum network introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 110501 (2004)] for different experimental scenarios. We first give a detailed discussion of the ideal scheme where no errors are present and full spatial resolution is available. Then we analyze the implementation of the network in an optical lattice. We find that even without any spatial resolution entanglement can be detected and characterized in various kinds of states including cluster states and macroscopic superposition states. We also study the effects of detection errors and imperfect dynamics on the detection network. For our scheme to be practical these errors have to be on the order of one over the number of investigated lattice sites. Finally, we consider the case of limited spatial resolution and conclude that significant improvement in entanglement detection and characterization compared to having no spatial resolution is only possible if single lattice sites can be resolved.

abstract: We study Bragg scattering at 1D optical lattices. Cold atoms are confined by the optical dipole force at the antinodes of a standing wave generated inside a laser-driven high-finesse cavity. The atoms arrange themselves into a chain of pancake-shaped layers located at the antinodes of the standing wave. Laser light incident on this chain is partially Bragg-reflected. We observe an angular dependence of this Bragg reflection which is different to what is known from crystalline solids. In solids the scattering layers can be taken to be infinitely spread (3D limit). This is not generally true for an optical lattice consistent of a 1D linear chain of point-like scattering sites. By an explicit structure factor calculation we derive a generalized Bragg condition, which is valid in the intermediate regime. This enables us to determine the aspect ratio of the atomic lattice from the angular dependance of the Bragg scattered light.

Dependent Pauli corrections are derived for all such patterns, which equalize all computation branches, and only depend on the underlying entanglement graph and its choice of inputs and outputs. The class of patterns having flow is stable under composition and tensorization, and has unitary embeddings as realizations. The restricted class of patterns having both flow and reverse flow, supports an operation of adjunction, and has all and only unitaries as realizations.

authors: Matti Selg
comments: 16 pages, 5 figures
journal: 
subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506064
abstract: Elegant and mathematically rigorous methods of the quantum inverse theory are difficult to put into practice because there is always some lack of needful input information. In this situation, one may try to construct a reference potential, whose spectral characteristics would be in a reasonable agreement with the available data of the system's properties. Since the reference potential is fixed, it is always possible to calculate all its spectral characteristics, including phase shift for scattering states and Jost function, the main key to solve the inverse problem. Thereafter, one can calculate a Bargmann potential whose Jost function differs from the initial one only by a rational factor. This way it is possible, at least in principle, to construct a more reliable potential for the system. The model system investigated in this paper is diatomic xenon molecule in ground electronic state. Its reference potential is built up of several smoothly joined Morse type components, which enables to solve the related energy eigenvalue problem exactly. Moreover, the phase shift can also be calculated in part analytically, and the Jost function can be acertained very accurately in the whole range of positive energies. Full energy dependence of the phase shift has been determined and its excellent agreement with the Levinson theorem demonstrated. In addition, asymptotically exact analytic formulas for the phase shift and the Jost function, independent of each other, are obtained and their physical background elucidated.

abstract: The jump process introduced by J. S. Bell in 1986, for defining a quantum field theory without observers, presupposes that space is discrete whereas time is continuous. In this letter, our interest is to find an analogous process in discrete time. We argue that a genuine analog does not exist, but provide examples of processes in discrete time that could be used as a replacement.

abstract: Taming quantum dynamical processes is the key to novel applications of quantum physics, e.g. in quantum information science. The control of light-matter interactions at the single-atom and single-photon level can be achieved in cavity quantum electrodynamics, in particular in the regime of strong coupling where atom and cavity form a single entity. In the optical domain, this requires permanent trapping and cooling of an atom in a micro-cavity. We have now realized three-dimensional cavity cooling and trapping for an orthogonal arrangement of cooling laser, trap laser and cavity vacuum. This leads to average single-atom trapping times exceeding 15 seconds, unprecedented for a strongly coupled atom under permanent observation.

abstract: Based on a recent proof of free choices in linking equations to the experiments they describe, I clarify relations among some purely mathematical entities featured in quantum mechanics (probabilities, density operators, partial traces, and operator-valued measures), thereby allowing applications of these entities to the modeling of a wider variety of physical situations. Conditional probabilities associated with projection-valued measures are expressed by introducing conditional density operators, identical in some but not all cases to the usual reduced density operators. By lifting density operators to the extended Hilbert space featured in Neumark's theorem, I show an obstacle to extending conditional density operators to arbitrary positive operator-valued measures (POVMs); however, tensor products of POVMs are compatible with conditional density operators. By way of application, conditional density operators together with the free choice of probe particles allow the so-called postulate of state reductions to be replaced by a theorem. A second application demonstrates an equivalence between one form of quantum key distribution and another, allowing a formulation of individual eavesdropping attacks against transmitted-state BB84 to work also for entangled-state BB84.

abstract: Operator quantum error-correction is a technique for robustly storing quantum information in the presence of noise. It generalizes the standard theory of quantum error-correction, and provides a unified framework for topics such as quantum error-correction, decoherence-free subspaces, and noiseless subsystems. This paper develops (a) easily applied algebraic and information-theoretic conditions which characterize when operator quantum error-correction is feasible; (b) a representation theorem for a class of noise processes which can be corrected using operator quantum error-correction; and (c) generalizations of the coherent information and quantum data processing inequality to the setting of operator quantum error-correction.

abstract: We develop a formal model for distributed measurement-based quantum computations, adopting an agent-based view, such that computations are described locally where possible. Because the network quantum state is in general entangled, we need to model it as a global structure, reminiscent of global memory in classical agent systems. Local quantum computations are described as measurement patterns. Since measurement-based quantum computation is inherently distributed, this allows us to extend naturally several concepts of the measurement calculus, a formal model for such computations. Our goal is to define an assembly language, i.e. we assume that computations are well-defined and we do not concern ourselves with verification techniques. The operational semantics for systems of agents is given by a probabilistic transition system, and we define operational equivalence in a way that it corresponds to the notion of bisimilarity. With this in place, we prove that teleportation is bisimilar to a direct quantum channel, and this also within the context of larger networks.

abstract: We investigate the problem of teleporting an unknown qubit state to a recipient via a channel of $2\L$ qubits. In this procedure a protocol is employed whereby $\L$ Bell state measurements are made and information based on these measurements is sent via a classical channel to the recipient. Upon receiving this information the recipient determines a local gate which is used to recover the original state. We find that the $2^{2\L}$-dimensional Hilbert space of states available for the channel admits a decomposition into four subspaces. Every state within a given subspace is a perfect channel, and each sequence of Bell measurements projects $2\L$ qubits of the system into one of the four subspaces. As a result, only two bits of classical information need be sent to the recipient for them to determine the gate. We note some connections between these four subspaces and ground states of many-body Hamiltonian systems, and discuss the implications of these results towards understanding entanglement in multi-qubit systems.

abstract: We solve the problem of discriminating with minimum error probability two given Pauli channels. We show that, differently from the case of discrimination between unitary transformations, the use of entanglement with an ancillary system can strictly improve the discrimination, and any maximally entangled state allows to achieve the optimal discrimination. We also provide a simple necessary and sufficient condition in terms of the structure of the channels for which the ultimate minimum error probability can be achieved without entanglement assistance. When such a condition is satisfied, the optimal input state is simply an eigenstate of one of the Pauli matrices.

abstract: We present a method to construct entanglement measures for pure states of multipartite qubit systems. The key element of our approach is an antilinear operator that we call {\em comb} in reference to the {\em hairy-ball theorem}. For qubits (or spin 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\CC)$. This implies that the {\em filters} obtained from the combs are entanglement monotones by construction. We give alternative formulae for the concurrence and the 3-tangle as expectation values of certain antilinear operators. As an application we discuss inequivalent types of genuine four-, five- and six-qubit entanglement.

With this method, we can form Hermitian, anti-Hermitian, symmetric and general matrices with arbitrary eigenvalues. In addition we propose an algorithm for diagonalizing such matrices. The functions required for the realization of this are probability amplitudes connecting observables with discrete eigenvalue spectra and can be obtained from spin theory. For the example case of $5\times 5$ matrices, these functions are given.

abstract: We report the first observation of above-threshold maser oscillation in a whispering-gallery(WG)-mode resonator, whose quasi-transverse-magnetic, 17th azimuthal-order WG mode, at a frequency of approx. 12.038 GHz, with a loaded Q of several hundred million, is supported on a cylinder of mono-crystalline sapphire. An electron spin resonance (ESR) associated with Fe3+ ions, that are substitutively included within the sapphire at a concentration of a few parts per billion, coincides in frequency with that of the (considerably narrower) WG mode. By applying a c.w. `pump' to the resonator at a frequency of approx. 31.34 GHz, with no applied d.c. magnetic field, the WG (`signal') mode is energized through a three-level maser scheme. Preliminary measurements demonstrate a frequency stability (Allan deviation) of a few times 1e-14 for sampling intervals up to 100 s.

abstract: Quantum state diffusion shows how stochastic interaction with the environment may cause localisation of the wave-function, and thereby demonstrates that quantum mechanics need not invoke a separate axiom of measurement to explain the emergence of the classical world. It has not been clear whether quantum state diffusion requires some new physics. We set up an explicit numerical calculation of the evolution of the wave-function of a two-state system under interaction using only the physics explicitly contained in quantum mechanics without an axiom of measurement. The wave-function does indeed localise, as proposed by quantum state diffusion, on eigenstates of the perturbation. The mechanism appears to be the superposition of histories evolving under different Hamiltonians.

abstract: Classical statistical average values are generally generalized to average values of quantum mechanics, it is discovered that quantum mechanics is direct generalization of classical statistical mechanics, and we generally deduce both a new general continuous eigenvalue equation and a general discrete eigenvalue equation in quantum mechanics, and discover that a eigenvalue of quantum mechanics is just an extreme value of an operator in possibility distribution, the eigenvalue f is just classical observable quantity. A general classical statistical uncertain relation is further given, the general classical statistical uncertain relation is generally generalized to quantum uncertainty principle, the two lost conditions in classical uncertain relation and quantum uncertainty principle, respectively, are found. We generally expound the relations among uncertainty principle, singularity and condensed matter stability, discover that quantum uncertainty principle prevents from the appearance of singularity of the electromagnetic potential between nucleus and electrons, and give the failure conditions of quantum uncertainty principle. Finally, we discover that the classical limit of quantum mechanics is classical statistical mechanics, the classical statistical mechanics may further be degenerated to classical mechanics, and we discover that only saying that the classical limit of quantum mechanics is classical mechanics is mistake. As application examples, we deduce both Shrodinger equation and state superposition principle, deduce that there exist decoherent factor from a general mathematical representation of state superposition principle, and the consistent difficulty between statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics and determinant property of classical mechanics is overcome.

abstract: This communication is an enquiry into the circumstances under which entropy and subentropy methods can give an answer to the question of quantum entanglement in the composite state. Using a general quantum dynamical system we obtain the analytical solution when the atom initially starts from its excited state and the field in different initial states. Different features of the entanglement are investigated when the field is initially assumed to be in a coherent state, an even coherent state (Schrodinger cate state) and a statistical mixture of coherent states. Our results show that the setting of the initial state and the Stark shift play important role in the evolution of the sub-entropies and entanglement.

abstract: The relationship between classical and quantum theory is of central importance to the philosophy of physics, and any interpretation of quantum mechanics has to clarify it. Our discussion of this relationship is partly historical and conceptual, but mostly technical and mathematically rigorous, including over 500 references. On the assumption that quantum mechanics is universal and complete, we discuss three ways in which classical physics has so far been believed to emerge from quantum physics, namely in the limit h -> 0 of small Planck's constant (in a finite system), in the limit of a large system, and through decoherence and consistent histores. The first limit is closely related to modern quantization theory and microlocal analysis, whereas the second involves methods of C*-algebras and the concepts of superselection sectors and macroscopic observables. In these limits, the classical world does not emerge as a sharply defined objective reality, but rather as an approximate appearance relative to certain "classical" states and observables. Decoherence subsequently clarifies the role of such states, in that they are "einselected", i.e. robust against coupling to the environment. Furthermore, the nature of classical observables is elucidated by the fact that they typically define (approximately) consistent sets of histories. We make the point that classicality results from the elimination of certain states and observables from quantum theory. Thus the classical world is not created by observation (as Heisenberg once claimed), but rather by the lack of it.

abstract: A typical feature of spontaneous collapse models which aim at localizing wavefunctions in space is the violation of the principle of energy conservation. In the models proposed in the literature the stochastic field which is responsible for the localization mechanism causes the momentum to behave like a Brownian motion, whose larger and larger fluctuations show up as a steady increase of the energy of the system. In spite of the fact that, in all situations, such an increase is small and practically undetectable, it is an undesirable feature that the energy of physical systems is not conserved but increases constantly in time, diverging for $t \to \infty$. In this paper we show that this property of collapse models can be modified: we propose a model of spontaneous wavefunction collapse sharing all most important features of usual models but such that the energy of isolated systems reaches an asymptotic finite value instead of increasing with a steady rate.

abstract: We study the conditions for generating spin squeezing via a quantum non-demolition measurement in an ensemble of cold 87Rb atoms. By considering the interaction of atoms in the 5S_{1/2}(F=1) ground state with probe light tuned near the D2 transition, we show that, for large detunings, this system is equivalent to a spin-1/2 system when suitable Zeeman substates and quantum operators are used to define a pseudo-spin. The degree of squeezing is derived for the rubidium system in the presence of scattering causing decoherence and loss. We describe how the system can decohere and lose atoms, and predict as much as 75% spin squeezing for atomic densities typical of optical dipole traps.

The results show measurable differences between regular and complex behaviour and for complex dynamics are faithful to the expected theoretical decay rate. Moreover, we illustrate how the experimental method can be seen as an efficient way for either extracting coarse-grained information about the dynamics of a large system, or measuring the decoherence rate from engineered environments.

abstract: The coupling of individual atoms to a high-finesse optical cavity is precisely controlled and adjusted using a standing-wave dipole-force trap, a challenge for strong atom-cavity coupling. Ultracold Rubidium atoms are first loaded into potential minima of the dipole trap in the center of the cavity. Then we use the trap as a conveyor belt that we set into motion perpendicular to the cavity axis. This allows us to repetitively move atoms out of and back into the cavity mode with a repositioning precision of 135 nm. This makes possible to either selectively address one atom of a string of atoms by the cavity, or to simultaneously couple two precisely separated atoms to a higher mode of the cavity.

abstract: We establish a connection between the problem of constructing maximal collections of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and an open problem in the theory of Lie algebras. More precisely, we show that a collection of m MUBs in K^n gives rise to a collection of m Cartan subalgebras of the special linear Lie algebra sl_n(K) that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form, where K=R or K=C. In particular, a complete collection of MUBs in C^n gives rise to a so-called orthogonal decomposition (OD) of sl_n(C). The converse holds if the Cartan subalgebras in the OD are also *-closed, i.e., closed under the adjoint operation. In this case, the Cartan subalgebras have unitary bases, and the above correspondence becomes equivalent to a result relating collections of MUBs to collections of maximal commuting classes of unitary error bases, i.e., orthogonal unitary matrices. It is a longstanding conjecture that ODs of sl_n(C) can only exist if n is a prime power. This corroborates further the general belief that a complete collection of MUBs can only exist in prime power dimensions. The connection to ODs of sl_n(C) potentially allows the application of known results on (partial) ODs of sl_n(C) to MUBs.

abstract: Quantum decay in an ac driven biased periodic potential modeling cold atoms in optical lattices is studied for a symmetry broken driving. For the case of fully chaotic classical dynamics the classical exponential decay is quantum mechanically suppressed for a driving frequency \omega in resonance with the Bloch frequency \omega_B, q\omega=r\omega_B with integers q and r. Asymptotically an algebraic decay ~t^{-\gamma} is observed. For r=1 the exponent \gamma agrees with $q$ as predicted by non-Hermitian random matrix theory for q decay channels. The time dependence of the survival probability can be well described by random matrix theory. The frequency dependence of the survival probability shows pronounced resonance peaks with sub-Fourier character.

It turns out that this system displays the family of complex eigenvalues corresponding to the poles of analytical continuation of the resolvent operator to the complex energy plane. It is shown that this representation is more suitable than the hyperbolic one used recently by Blasone and Jizba.

abstract: We propose a scheme of multipartite entanglement distillation driven by a complementary pair of stabilizer measurements, to distill directly a wider range of states beyond the stabilizer code states (such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states). We make our idea explicit by constructing a recurrence protocol for the 3-qubit W state. Noisy W states resulting from typical decoherence can be directly purified in a few steps, if their initial fidelity is larger than a threshold. For general input mixed states, we observe distillations to hierarchical fixed points, i.e., not only to the W state but also to the 2-qubit Bell pair, depending on their initial entanglement.

Concurrency control techniques and extra registers for marking and storing the solutions are used in the modified algorithm. This requires additional space but it is shown that the use of extra register and marking techniques can reduce the time complexity to $O(M+\log N)$.

abstract: We extend the application of the techniques developed within the framework of the pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics to study a unitary quantum system described by an imaginary PT-symmetric potential v(x) having a continuous real spectrum. For this potential that has recently been used, in the context of optical potentials, for modelling the propagation of electromagnetic waves travelling in a wave guide half and half filed with gain and absorbing media, we give a perturbative construction of the physical Hilbert space, observables, localized states, and the equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian. Ignoring terms of order three or higher in the non-Hermiticity parameter zeta, we show that the equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian has the form $\frac{p^2}{2m}+\frac{\zeta^2}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\{\alpha_n(x),p^{2n}\}$ with $\alpha_n(x)$ vanishing outside an interval that is three times larger than the support of $v(x)$, i.e., in 2/3 of the physical interaction region the potential $v(x)$ vanishes identically. We provide a physical interpretation for this unusual behavior and comment on the classical limit of the system.

abstract: Using pure entangled Schmidt states, we show that m-positivity of a map is bounded by the ranks of its negative Kraus matrices. We also give an algebraic condition for a map to be m-positive. We interpret these results in the context of positive maps as entanglement witnesses, and find that only 1-positive maps are needed for testing entanglement.

The investigation is based on a realistic physical model of the graph in which decoherence is induced by continuous monitoring of each graph vertex with nearby quantum point contact. We derive the analytical expression of the probability distribution along the cycle. Upper bound estimate to mixing time is shown.

abstract: We present and demonstrate a new protocol for practical quantum cryptography, tailored for an implementation with weak coherent pulses to obtain a high key generation rate. The key is obtained by a simple time-of-arrival measurement on the data line; the presence of an eavesdropper is checked by an interferometer on an additional monitoring line. The setup is experimentally simple; moreover, it is tolerant to reduced interference visibility and to photon number splitting attacks, thus featuring a high efficiency in terms of distilled secret bit per qubit.

abstract: A method for gaining information about the phonon-number moments and the generalized nonlinear and linear quadratures in the motion of trapped ions (in particular, position and momentum) is proposed, valid inside and outside the Lamb-Dicke regime. It is based on the measurement of first time derivatives of electronic populations, evaluated at the motion-probe interaction time t=0. In contrast to other state-reconstruction proposals, based on measuring Rabi oscillations or dispersive interactions, the present scheme can be performed resonantly at infinitesimal short motion-probe interaction times, remaining thus insensitive to decoherence processes.

abstract: We define what it means for a state in a convex cone of states on a space of observables to be generalized-entangled relative to a subspace of the observables, in a general ordered linear spaces framework for operational theories. This extends the notion of ordinary entanglement in quantum information theory to a much more general framework. Some important special cases are described, in which the distinguished observables are subspaces of the observables of a quantum system, leading to results like the identification of generalized unentangled states with Lie-group-theoretic coherent states when the special observables form an irreducibly represented Lie algebra. Some open problems, including that of generalizing the semigroup of local operations with classical communication to the convex cones setting, are discussed.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506100
abstract: A new ontological view of the quantum measurement processes is given, which has bearings on many broader issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics as well. In this scenario a quantum measurement is a non-equilibrium phase transition in a ``resonant cavity'' formed by the entire physical universe including all of its material and energy content. A quantum measurement involves the energy and matter exchange among not only the system being measured and the measuring apparatus but also the global environment of the universe resonant cavity, which together constrain the nature of the phase transition. Strict realism, including strict energy and angular momentum conservation, is recovered in this view of the quantum measurement process beyond the limit set by the uncertainty relations, which are themselves derived from the exact commutation relations for quantum conjugate variables. Both the amplitude and the phase of the quantum mechanical wavefunction acquire substantial meanings in the new ontology, and the probabilistic element is removed from the foundations of quantum mechanics, its apparent presence in the quantum measurement being solely a result of the sensitive dependence on initial/boundary conditions of the phase transitions of a many degree-of-freedom system which is effectively the whole universe. Vacuum fluctuations are viewed as the ``left over'' fluctuations after forming the whole numbers of nonequilibrium resonant modes in the universe cavity. This new view on the quantum processes helps to clarify many puzzles in the foundations of quantum mechanics.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506101
abstract: We propose to apply atom-chip techniques to the trapping of a single atom in a circular Rydberg state. The small size of microfabricated structures will allow for trap geometries with microwave cut-off frequencies high enough to inhibit the spontaneous emission of the Rydberg atom, paving the way to complete control of both external and internal degrees of freedom over very long times. Trapping is achieved using carefully designed electric fields, created by a simple pattern of electrodes. We show that it is possible to excite, and then trap, one and only one Rydberg atom from a cloud of ground state atoms confined on a magnetic atom chip, itself integrated with the Rydberg trap. Distinct internal states of the atom are simultaneously trapped, providing us with a two-level system extremely attractive for atom-surface and atom-atom interaction studies. We describe a method for reducing by three orders of magnitude dephasing due to Stark shifts, induced by the trapping field, of the internal transition frequency. This allows for, in combination with spin-echo techniques, maintenance of an internal coherence over times in the second range. This method operates via a controlled light shift rendering the two internal states' Stark shifts almost identical. We thoroughly identify and account for sources of imperfection in order to verify at each step the realism of our proposal.

abstract: Quantum photon-number fluctuation and correlation of bound soliton pairs in mode-locked fiber lasers are studied based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation model. We find that, depending on their phase difference, the total photon-number noise of the bound soliton pair can be larger or smaller than that of a single soliton and the two solitons in the soliton pairs are with positive or negative photon-number correlation, correspondingly. It is predicted for the first time that out-of-phase soliton pairs can exhibit less noises due to negative correlation.

abstract: We study the quantization of a classical system of interacting particles obeying a recently proposed kinetic interaction principle (KIP) [G. Kaniadakis, Physica A {\bf 296}, 405 (2001)]. The KIP fixes the expression of the Fokker-Planck equation describing the kinetic evolution of the system and imposes the form of its entropy. In the framework of canonical quantization, we introduce a class of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NSEs) with complex nonlinearities, describing, in the mean field approximation, a system of collectively interacting particles whose underlying kinetics is governed by the KIP. We derive the Ehrenfest relations and discuss the main constants of motion arising in this model. By means of a nonlinear gauge transformation of third kind it is shown that in the case of constant diffusion and linear drift the class of NSEs obeying the KIP is gauge-equivalent to another class of NSEs containing purely real nonlinearities depending only on the field $\rho=|\psi|^2$.

abstract: Grover's search algorithm searches a database of $N$ unsorted items in $O(\sqrt{N/M})$ steps where $M$ represents the number of solutions to the search problem. This paper proposes a scheme for searching a database of $N$ unsorted items in $O(logN)$ steps, provided the value of $M$ is known. It is also shown that when $M$ is unknown but if we can estimate an upper bound of possible values of $M$, then an improvement in the time complexity of conventional Grover's algorithm is possible. In that case, the present scheme reduces the time complexity to $O(MlogN)$.

abstract: We have built an atom interferometer and, by applying an electric field on one of the two interfering beams, we have measured the static electric polarizability of lithium with a 0.66 % uncertainty. Our experiment is similar to an experiment done on sodium in 1995 by D. Pritchard and co-workers, with several improvements: the electric field can be calculated analytically and our phase measurements are very accurate. This experiment illustrates the extreme sensitivity of atom interferometry: when the atom enters the electric field, its velocity increases and the fractional change, equal to 4 x 10^(-9) for our largest field, is measured with a 10^(-3) accuracy.

abstract: We study private quantum channels on a single qubit, which encrypt given set of plaintext states $P$. Specifically, we determine all achievable states $\rho^{(0)}$ (average output of encryption) and for each particular set $P$ we determine the entropy of the key necessary and sufficient to encrypt this set. It turns out that single bit of key is sufficient when the set $P$ is two dimensional. However, the necessary and sufficient entropy of the key in case of three dimensional $P$ varies continuously between 1 and 2 bits depending on the state $\rho^{(0)}$. Finally, we derive private quantum channels achieving these bounds. We show that the impossibility of universal NOT operation on qubit can be derived from the fact that one bit of key is not sufficient to encrypt qubit.

abstract: We analyze in details the properties of the conditional state recently obtained by J. Wenger, et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 153601 (2004)] by means of inconclusive photon subtraction (IPS) on a squeezed vacuum state $S(r)\ket{0}$. The IPS process can be characterized by two parameters: the IPS transmissivity $\tau$ and the photodetection quantum efficiency $\eta$. We found that the conditional state approaches the squeezed Fock state $S(r)\ket{1}$ when $\tau,\eta \to 1$, i.e., in the limit of single-photon subtraction. For non-unit IPS transmissivity and efficiency, the conditioned state remains close to the target state, {\em i.e.} shows a high fidelity for a wide range of experimental parameters. The nonclassicality of the conditional state is also investigated and a nonclassicality threshold on the IPS parameters is derived.

abstract: We present a scheme for rapidly entangling matter qubits in order to create graph states for one-way quantum computing. The qubits can be simple 3-level systems in separate cavities. Coupling involves only local fields and a static (unswitched) linear optics network. Fusion of graph state sections occurs with, in principle, zero probability of damaging the nascent graph state. We avoid the finite thresholds of other schemes by operating on two entangled pairs, so that each generates exactly one photon. We do not require the relatively slow single qubit local flips to be applied during the growth phase: growth of the graph state can then become a purely optical process. The scheme naturally generates graph states with vertices of high degree and so is easily able to construct minimal graph states, with consequent resource savings. The most efficient approach will be to create new graph state edges even as qubits elsewhere are measured, in a `just in time' approach. An error analysis indicates that the scheme is relatively robust against imperfections in the apparatus.

abstract: According to the Quantum de Finetti Theorem, locally normal infinite particle states with Bose-Einstein symmetry can be represented as mixtures of infinite tensor powers of vector states. This note presents examples of infinite-particle states with Bose-Einstein symmetry that arise as limits of Gibbs ensembles on finite dimensional spaces, and displays their de Finetti representations. We consider Gibbs ensembles for systems of bosons in a finite dimensional setting and discover limits as the number of particles tends to infinity, provided the temperature is scaled in proportion to particle number.

abstract: The correspondence principle is investigated in the framework of deterministic predictions for individual systems. Exact analytical results are obtained for the quantum and the Liouvillian dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator coupled to a phase-damping reservoir at a finite temperature. In this context, the time of critical wave function spreading - the Ehrenfest time - emerges as the characteristic time scale within which the concept of deterministic behavior is admissible in physics. A scenario of "quasi-determinism" may be then defined within which the motion is experimentally indistinguishable from the truly deterministic motion of Newtonian mechanics. Beyond this time scale, predictions for individual systems can be given only statistically and, in this case, it is shown that diffusive decoherence is indeed a necessary ingredient to establish the quantum-classical correspondence. Moreover, the high-temperature regime is shown to be an additional condition for the quantum-classical transition and, accordingly, a lower bound for the reservoir temperature is derived for our model.

abstract: We show that a dynamical spacetime generates entanglement between modes of a quantum field. Conversely, the entanglement encodes information concerning the underlying spacetime structure, which hints at the prospect of applications of this observation to cosmology. Here we illustrate this point by way of an analytically exactly soluble example, that of a scalar quantum field on a two-dimensional asymptotically flat Robertson-Walker expanding spacetime. We explicitly calculate the entanglement in the far future, for a quantum field residing in the vacuum state in the distant past. In this toy universe, it is possible to fully reconstruct the parameters of the cosmic history from the entanglement entropy.

abstract: Quantum information offers the promise of being able to perform certain communication and computation tasks that cannot be done with conventional information technology (IT). Optical Quantum Information Processing (QIP) holds particular appeal, since it offers the prospect of communicating and computing with the same type of qubit. Linear optical techniques have been shown to be scalable, but the corresponding quantum computing circuits need many auxiliary resources. Here we present an alternative approach to optical QIP, based on the use of weak cross-Kerr nonlinearities and homodyne measurements. We show how this approach provides the fundamental building blocks for highly efficient non-absorbing single photon number resolving detectors, two qubit parity detectors, Bell state measurements and finally near deterministic control-not (CNOT) gates. These are essential QIP devices

We delineate an aspect of the border between the possible and the impossible concerning quantum cloning, by putting forward an entanglement-assisted scheme for simulating perfect cloning in the context of weak measurements. This phenomenon we call weak cloning of an unknown quantum state.

abstract: We have performed a precise experimental determination of the Casimir pressure between two gold-coated parallel plates by means of a micromachined oscillator. In contrast to all previous experiments on the Casimir effect, where a small relative error (varying from 1% to 15%) was achieved only at the shortest separation, our smallest experimental error ($\sim 0.5$%) is achieved over a wide separation range from 170 nm to 300 nm at 95% confidence. We have formulated a rigorous metrological procedure for the comparison of experiment and theory without resorting to the previously used root-mean-square deviation, which has been criticized in the literature. This enables us to discriminate among different competing theories of the thermal Casimir force, and to resolve a thermodynamic puzzle arising from the application of Lifshitz theory to real metals. Our results lead to a more rigorous approach for obtaining constraints on hypothetical long-range interactions predicted by extra-dimensional physics and other extensions of the Standard Model. In particular, the constraints on non-Newtonian gravity are strengthened by up to a factor of 20 in a wide interaction range at 95% confidence.

abstract: We investigate the non-dissipative decoherence of three qubit system obtained by manipulating the state of a trapped two-level ion coupled to an optical cavity. Modelling the environment as a set of noninteracting harmonic oscillators, analytical expressions for the state operator of tripartite composite system, the probability of generating maximally entangled GHZ state, and the population inversion have been obtained. The pointer observable is the energy of the isolated quantum system. Coupling to environment results in exponential decay of off diagonal matrix elements of the state operator with time as well as a phase decoherence of the component states. Numerical calculations to examine the time evolution of GHZ state generation probability and population inversion for different system environment coupling strengths are performed. Using negativity as an entanglement measure and linear entropy as a measure of mixedness, the entanglement dynamics of the tripartite system in the presence of decoherence is analysed.

We compute Gaussian measures explicitely for two important families of nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian states, namely the states of extremal (maximal and minimal) negativities at fixed global and local purities, introduced in [G. Adesso {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 087901 (2004)]. This allows us to compare the {\em orderings} induced on the set of entangled two--mode Gaussian states by the negativities and by the Gaussian entanglement measures. We find that in a certain range of global and local purities (characterizing the covariance matrix of the corresponding extremal states), states of minimum negativity can have more Gaussian entanglement than states of maximum negativity. Thus Gaussian measures and negativities are definitely inequivalent on nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian states (even when restricted to extremal states), while they are completely equivalent on symmetric states, where moreover the Gaussian entanglement of formation coincides with the true one. However, the inequivalence between these two families of continuous-variable entanglement measures is somehow limited. In fact we show rigorously that, at fixed negativities, the Gaussian entanglement measures are bounded from below, and we provide strong evidence that they are also bounded from above.

abstract: We numerically demonstrate that "mode-entangled states" based on the transverse modes of classical optical fields in multimode waveguides violate Bell's inequality. Numerically simulating the correlation measurement scheme of Bell's inequality, we obtain the normalized correlation functions of the intensity fluctuations for the two entangled classical fields. By using the correlation functions, the maximum violations of Bell's inequality are obtained. This implies that the two classical fields in the mode-entangled states, although spatially separated, present a nonlocal correlation.

abstract: This thesis deals with a series of quantum computer implementation issues from the Kane 31P in 28Si architecture to Shor's integer factoring algorithm and beyond. The discussion begins with simulations of the adiabatic Kane CNOT and readout gates, followed by linear nearest neighbor implementations of 5-qubit quantum error correction with and without fast measurement. A linear nearest neighbor circuit implementing Shor's algorithm is presented, then modified to remove the need for exponentially small rotation gates. Finally, a method of constructing optimal approximations of arbitrary single-qubit fault-tolerant gates is described and applied to the specific case of the remaining rotation gates required by Shor's algorithm.

abstract: We present an entanglement criterion for multiqubits by using the quantum correlation tensors which rely on the expectation values of the Pauli operators for a multiqubit state. Our criterion explains not only the total entanglement of the system but also the partial entanglement in subsystems. It shows that we have to consider the subsystem entanglements in order to obtain the full description for multiqubit entanglements. Furthermore, we offer an extension of the entanglement to multiqudits.

abstract: Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), which are such that the inner product between two vectors in different orthogonal bases is a constant equal to 1/sqrt{d), with d the dimension of the finite Hilbert space, are becoming more and more studied for applications such as quantum tomography and cryptography, and in relation to entangled states and to the Heisenberg-Weil group of quantum optics. Complete sets of MUBs of cardinality d+1 have been derived for prime power dimensions d=p^m using the tools of abstract algebra. Presumably, for non prime dimensions the cardinality is much less. Here we reinterpret MUBs as quantum phase states, i.e. as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators generalizing those introduced by Pegg & Barnett in 1989. We relate MUB states to additive characters of Galois fields (in odd characteristic p) and to Galois rings (in characteristic 2). Quantum Fourier transforms of the components in vectors of the bases define a more general class of MUBs with multiplicative characters and additive ones altogether. We investigate the complementary properties of the above phase operator with respect to the number operator. We also study the phase probability distribution and variance for general pure quantum electromagnetic states and find them to be related to the Gauss sums, which are sums over all elements of the field (or of the ring) of the product of multiplicative and additive characters. Finally, we relate the concepts of mutual unbiasedness and maximal entanglement. This allows to use well studied algebraic concepts as efficient tools in the study of entanglement and its information aspects

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506129
abstract: In this work a general relativistic generalization of Bell inequality is suggested. Namely,it is proved that practically in any general relativistic metric there is a generalization of Bell inequality.It can be satisfied within theories of local (subluminal) hidden variables, but it cannot be satisfied in the general case within standard quantum mechanical formalism or within theories of nonlocal (superluminal) hidden variables. It is shown too that within theories of nonlocal hidden variables but not in the standard quantum mechanical formalism a paradox appears in the situation when one of the correlated subsystems arrives at a Schwarzschild black hole. Namely, there is no way that black hole horizon obstructs superluminal influences between spin of the subsystem without horizon and spin of the subsystem within horizon,or simply speaking,there is none black hole horizon nor "no hair" theorem for subsystems with correlated spins. It implies that standard quantum mechanical formalism yields unique consistent and complete description of the quantum mechanical phenomenons.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: A reference potential approach to the one-dimensional quantum-mechanical inverse problem is developed. All spectral characteristics of the system, including its discrete energy spectrum, the full energy dependence of the phase shift, and the Jost function, are expected to be known. The technically most complicated task in ascertaining the potential, solution of a relevant integral equation, has been decomposed into two relatively independent problems. First, one uses Krein method to calculate an auxiliary potential with exactly the same spectral density as the initial reference potential, but with no bound states. Thereafter, using Gelfand-Levitan method, it is possible to introduce, one by one, all bound states, along with calculating another auxiliary potential of the same spectral density at each step. For the system under study (diatomic xenon molecule), the kernel of the Krein integral equation can be accurately ascertained with the help of solely analytic means. At small distances the calculated auxiliary potential with no bound states practically coincides with the initial reference potential, which is in full agreement with general theoretical considerations. Several possibilities of solving the Krein equation are proposed and the prospects of further research discussed.

abstract: The general form of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy density of black-body radiation is generalized to a spacetime with extra dimensions using standard kinetic and thermodynamic arguments. From statistical mechanics one obtains an exact formula. In a field-theoretic derivation, the Maxwell field must be quantized. The notion of electric and magnetic fields is different in spacetimes with more than four dimensions. While the energy-momentum tensor for the Maxwell field is traceless in four dimensions, it is not so when there are extra dimensions. But it is shown that its thermal average is traceless and in agreement with the thermodynamic results.

abstract: These lecture notes survey some joint work with Samson Abramsky. Somewhat informally I will discuss the main results in a pedestrian not too technical way. These include: (1) `The logic of entanglement', that is, the identification and abstract axiomatization of the `quantum information-flow' which enables protocols such as quantum teleportation. To this means we define strongly compact closed categories which abstractly capture the behavioral properties of quantum entanglement. (2) `Postulates for an abstract quantum formalism' in which classical information-flow (e.g. token exchange) is part of the formalism. As an example, we provide a purely formal description of quantum teleportation and prove correctness in abstract generality. In this formalism types reflect kinds, contra the essentially typeless von Neumann formalism. Hence even concretely this formalism manifestly improves on the usual one. (3) `A high-level approach to quantum informatics'.

url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506134
abstract: Elaborating on our joint work with Abramsky in quant-ph/0402130 we further unravel the linear structure of Hilbert spaces into several constituents. Some prove to be very crucial for particular features of quantum theory while others obstruct the passage to a formalism which is not saturated with physically insignificant global phases. First we show that the bulk of the required linear structure is purely multiplicative, and arises from the strongly compact closed tensor which, besides providing a variety of notions such as scalars, trace, unitarity, self-adjointness and bipartite projectors, also provides Hilbert-Schmidt norm, Hilbert-Schmidt inner-product, and in particular, the preparation-state agreement axiom which enables the passage from a formalism of the vector space kind to a rather projective one, as it was intended in the (in)famous Birkhoff & von Neumann paper. Next we consider additive types which distribute over the tensor, from which measurements can be build, and the correctness proofs of the protocols discussed in quant-ph/0402130 carry over to the resulting weaker setting. A full probabilistic calculus is obtained when the trace is moreover linear and satisfies the \em diagonal axiom, which brings us to a second main result, characterization of the necessary and sufficient additive structure of a both qualitatively and quantitatively effective categorical quantum formalism without redundant global phases. Along the way we show that if in a category a (additive) monoidal tensor distributes over a strongly compact closed tensor, then this category is always enriched in commutative monoids.

The significance of our method is illustrated by giving a quantitative evaluation of entanglement for many bound entangled states, some of which fail to be identified by the usual concurrence estimation method.

abstract: We derive a new inequality for entanglement for a mixed four-partite state. Employing this inequality, we present a one-shot lower bound for entanglement cost and prove that entanglement cost is strictly larger than zero for any entangled state. We demonstrate that irreversibility occurs in the process of formation for all non-distillable entangled states. In this way we solve a long standing problem, of how "real" is entanglement of bound entangled states. Using the new inequality we also prove impossibility of local-cloning of a known entangled state.

abstract: We present the first measurement of squeezed-state entanglement between the twin beams produced in an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) operating above threshold. Besides the usual squeezing in the intensity difference between the twin beams, we have measured squeezing in the sum of phase quadratures. Our scheme enables us to measure such phase anti-correlations between fields of different frequencies. In the present measurements, wavelengths differ by ~1 nm. Entanglement is demonstrated according to the Duan et al. criterion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2722 (2000)] $\Delta^2\hat{p}_- +\Delta^2\hat{q}_+=1.47(2)<2$. This experiment opens the way for new potential applications such as the transfer of quantum information between different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

abstract: The closed causal chains arising from backward time travel do not lead to paradoxes if they are self consistent. This raises the question as to how physics ensures that only self-consistent loops are possible. We show that, for one particular case at least, the condition of self consistency is ensured by the interference of quantum mechanical amplitudes associated with the loop. If this can be applied to all loops then we have a mechanism by which inconsistent loops eliminate themselves.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: General semiclassical expression for quantum fidelity (Loschmidt echo) of arbitrary pure and mixed states is derived. It expresses fidelity as an interference sum of dephasing trajectories weighed by the Wigner function of the initial state, and does not require that the initial state be localized in position or momentum. This general dephasing representation is special in that, counterintuitively, all of fidelity decay is due to dephasing and none due to the decay of classical overlaps. Surprising accuracy of the approximation is justified by invoking the shadowing theorem: twice--both for physical perturbations and for numerical errors. It is shown how the general expression reduces to the special forms for position and momentum states and for wave packets localized in position or momentum. The superiority of the general over the specialized forms is explained and supported by numerical tests for wave packets, non-local pure states, and for simple and random mixed states. The tests are done in non-universal regimes in mixed phase space where detailed features of fidelity are important. Although semiclassically motivated, present approach is valid for abstract systems with a finite Hilbert basis provided that the discrete Wigner transform is used. This makes the method applicable, via a phase space approach, e. g., to problems of quantum computation.

abstract: We address the problem of spring-like coupling between bosons in an open chain configuration where the counter-rotating terms are explicitly included. We show that fruitful insight can be gained by decomposing the time-evolution operator of this problem into a pattern of linear-optics elements. This allows us to provide a clear picture of the effects of the counter-rotating terms in the important problem of long-haul entanglement distribution. The analytic control over the variance matrix of the state of the bosonic register allows us to track the dynamics of the entanglement. This helps in designing a global addressing scheme, complemented by a proper initialization of the register, which quantitatively improves the entanglement between the extremal oscillators in the chain, thus providing a strategy for feasible long distance entanglement distribution.

The present paper returns to the same example, and shows that the best result so far achieved can alternatively be attained by a measurement that, while still global, is "unentangled" in the sense that the operator associated with each measurement outcome is a tensor product.

abstract: Computing the entanglement of formation of a bipartite state is generally difficult, but special symmetries of a state can simplify the problem. For instance, this allows one to determine the entanglement of formation of Werner states and isotropic states. We consider a slightly more general class of states, rotationally symmetric states, also known as SU(2)-invariant states. These states are invariant under global rotations of both subsystems, and one can examine entanglement in cases where the subsystems have different dimensions. We derive an analytic expression for the entanglement of formation of rotationally symmetric states of a spin-$j$ particle and a spin-${1\over2}$ particle. We also give expressions for the I-concurrence, I-tangle, and convex-roof-extended negativity.

The efficiency of the criterion and the method is exhibited by the classification of true entanglement in some types of the tripartite systems.

abstract: We have obtained a set of coupled differential equations from the continuous limit of the transfer matrix method. Decoupling such a set of equations yields an extension to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the position-dependent effective mass (PDEM). In the classically allowed region, the decoupling is to ignore the reflection resulting from the variations of both the potential and effective mass. By considering an infinite-well example with the PDEM, it is shown that the extended WKB approximation can provide not only an estimation to eigenenergies, but also an analytic form to approximate wavefunctions.

abstract: Non existence of Universal NOT gate for arbitrary quantum mechanical states is a fundamental constraint on the allowed operations performed on physical systems. The largest set of states that can be flipped by using a single NOT gate is the set of states lying on a great circle of the Bloch-sphere. In this paper, we show the impossibility of universal exact-flipping operation, first by using the fact that no faster than light communication is possible and then by using the principle of "non-increase of entanglement under LOCC". Interestingly, exact flipping of the states of any great circle does not violate these two principles, as expected.

abstract: A kind of brand-new robot, quantum robot, is proposed through fusing quantum theory with robot technology. Quantum robot is essentially a complex quantum system and it is generally composed of three fundamental parts: MQCU (multi quantum computing units), quantum controller/actuator, and information acquisition units. Corresponding to the system structure, several learning control algorithms including quantum searching algorithm and quantum reinforcement learning are presented for quantum robot. The theoretic results show that quantum robot can reduce the complexity of O(N^2) in traditional robot to O(N^(3/2)) using quantum searching algorithm, and the simulation results demonstrate that quantum robot is also superior to traditional robot in efficient learning by novel quantum reinforcement learning algorithm. Considering the advantages of quantum robot, its some potential important applications are also analyzed and prospected.

abstract: We study the quantum state transfer (QST) of a class of tight-bonding Bloch electron systems with mirror symmetry by considering the mode entanglement. Some rigorous results are obtained to reveal the intrinsic relationship between the fidelity of QST and the mirror mode concurrence (MMC), which is defined to measure the mode entanglement with a certain spatial symmetry and is just the overlap of a proper wave function with its mirror image. A complementarity is discovered as the maximum fidelity is accompanied by a minimum of MMC. And at the instant, which is just half of the characteristic time required to accomplish a perfect QST, the MMC can reach its maximum value one. A large class of perfect QST models with a certain spectrum structure are discovered to support our analytical results.

abstract: We demonstrate a weak continuous measurement of the pseudo-spin associated with the clock transition in a sample of Cs atoms. Our scheme uses an optical probe tuned near the D1 transition to measure the sample birefringence, which depends on the z-component of the collective pseudospin. At certain probe frequencies the differential light shift of the clock states vanishes and the measurement is non-perturbing. In dense samples the measurement can be used to squeeze the collective clock pseudo-spin, and has potential to improve the performance of atomic clocks and interferometers.

abstract: In relation of observable and quantum state, the entity $I_C$ from previous work quantifies simultaneously coherence, incompatibility and quantumness. In this article its application to quantum correlations in bipartite states is studied. It is shown that Zurek's quantum discord can always be expressed as excess coherence information (global minus local). Strong and weak zero-discord cases are distinguished and investigated in terms of necessary and sufficient and sufficient conditions respectively. A unique string of relevant subsystem observables, each a function of the next, for "interrogating" the global state about the state of the opposite subsystem is derived with detailed entropy and information gain discussion. The apparent disappearance of discord in measurement is investigated, and it is shown that it is actually shifted from between subsystems 1 and 2 to between subsystems 1 and $(2+3)$, where 3 is the measuring instrument. Finally, it is shown that the global coherence information $I_C(A_2,\rho_{12})$ is shifted into the global coherence information $I_C(A_2,\rho_{123}^f)$ in the final state $\rho_{123}^f$ of the measurement interaction.

abstract: In this paper we consider the generation of a three-qubit GHZ-like thermal state by applying the entanglement swapping scheme of Zukowski {\it et al.} [Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. {\bf 755}, 91 (1995)] to three pairs of two-qubit Heisenberg XY chains. The quality of the resulting three-qubit entanglement is studied by analyzing the teleportation fidelity, when it is used as a resource in the teleportation protocol of Karlsson {\it et al.}[Phys. Rev. A {\bf 58}, 4394 (1998)]. We show that even though thermal noise in the original two-qubit states is amplified by the entanglement swapping process, we are still able to achieve nonclassical fidelities for the anisotropic Heisenberg XY chains at finitely higher and higher temperatures by adjusting the strengths of an external magnetic field. This has a positive implication on the solid-state realization of a quantum computer.

abstract: The standard assumption for the equilibrium microcanonical state in quantum mechanics, that the system must be in one of the energy eigenstates, is weakened so as to allow superpositions of states. The weakened form of the microcanonical postulate thus asserts that all quantum states giving rise to the same energy expectation value must be realised with equal probability. The consequences that follow from this assertion are investigated. In particular, a closed-form expression for the density of states associated with any system having a nondegenerate energy spectrum is obtained. The result is applied to a variety of examples, for which the behaviour of the state density, as well as the relation between energy and temperature, are determined. Numerical studies indicate that the density of states converges to a distribution when the number of energy levels approaches infinity.

abstract: We show how to make event-ready multi-partite entanglement between qubits which may be encoded on photons or matter systems. Entangled states of matter systems, which can also act as single photon sources, can be generated using the entangling operation presented in quant-ph/0408040. We show how to entangle such sources with photon qubits, which may be encoded in the dual rail, polarization or time-bin degrees of freedom. We subsequently demonstrate how projective measurements of the matter qubits can be used to create entangled states of the photons alone. The state of the matter qubits is inherited by the generated photons. Since the entangling operation can be used to generate cluster states of matter qubits for quantum computing, our procedure enables us to create any (entangled) photonic quantum state that can be written as the outcome of a quantum computer.

The certainty principle for quantum systems is formulated and proved. It turns out that the certainty principle is closely connected with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (it presents, in some sense, an opposite point of view). But at the same time the certainty principle allows to give rigorous formulations for wider class of problems (it allows to rigorously interpret and ground the analogous inequalities for the pairs of quantities like time - energy, angle - angular momentum etc.)

The physics beyond this approach is dark resonance splitting caused by interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment with the external magnetic field.

abstract: We address the distribution of quantum information among many parties in the presence of noise. In particular, we consider how to optimally send to m receivers the information encoded into an unknown coherent state. On one hand, a local strategy is considered, consisting in a local cloning process followed by direct transmission. On the other hand, a telecloning protocol based on nonlocal quantum correlations is analyzed. Both the strategies are optimized to minimize the detrimental effects due to losses and thermal noise along the propagation. The comparison between the local and the nonlocal protocol shows that telecloning is more effective than local cloning for a wide range of noise parameters. Our results indicate that nonlocal strategies can be more robust against noise than local ones, thus being suitable candidates to play a major role in quantum information networks.

abstract: We discuss the relation between entanglement and criticality in translationally invariant harmonic lattice systems with non-randon, finite-range interactions. We show that the criticality of the system as well as validity or break-down of the entanglement area law are solely determined by the analytic properties of the spectral function of the oscillator system, which can easily be computed. In particular for finite-range couplings we find a one-to-one correspondence between an area-law scaling of the bi-partite entanglement and a finite correlation length. This relation is strict in the one-dimensional case and there is strog evidence for the multi-dimensional case. We also discuss generalizations to couplings with infinite range. Finally, to illustrate our results, a specific 1D example with nearest and next-nearest neighbor coupling is analyzed.

The number of pure states that can be discriminated by local operations and classical communication is bounded by the total dimension over the average entanglement. A similar, general condition is also shown for pure and mixed states. These results offer a rare operational interpretation for three abstractly defined distance like measures of multipartite entanglement.

We develop a generalized approach to adiabatic quantum pumping as traditional methods based on scattering matrix in one dimension cannot be applied here. We specifically compute the flow of spin-entangled electrons within a Hubbard-like model of quantum dots, and discuss possible implementations and identify parameters that can be used to control the singlet flow.

abstract: We explain why, in a configuration space that is multiply connected, i.e., whose fundamental group is nontrivial, there are several quantum theories, corresponding to different choices of topological factors. We do this in the context of Bohmian mechanics, a quantum theory without observers from which the quantum formalism can be derived. What we do can be regarded as generalizing the Bohmian dynamics on $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds, and classifying the possible dynamics that arise. This approach provides a new understanding of the topological features of quantum theory, such as the symmetrization postulate for identical particles. For our analysis we employ wave functions on the universal covering space of the configuration space.

abstract: Quantum information, though not precisely defined, is a fundamental concept of quantum information theory which predicts many fascinating phenomena and provides new physical resources. A basic problem is to recognize the features of quantum systems responsible for those phenomena. One of such important features is that non-commuting quantum states cannot be broadcast: two copies cannot be obtained out of a single copy, not even reproduced marginally on separate systems. We focus on the difference of information contents between one copy and two copies which is a basic manifestation of the gap between quantum and classical information. We show that if the chosen information measure is the Holevo quantity, the difference between the information contents of one copy and two copies is zero if and only if the states can be broadcast. We propose a new approach in defining measures of quantumness of ensembles based on the difference of information contents between the original ensemble and the ensemble of duplicated states. We comment about the permanence property of quantum states and the recently introduced superbroadcasting operation. We also provide an Appendix where we discuss the status of quantum information in quantum physics, basing on the so-called isomorphism principle.

abstract: The purpose of this paper is to show that: when a single particle moving under 3-proper time (three-dimensional time), the trajectories of a classical particle are equivalent to a quantum field with spin. Three-proper time models are built for spinless particle, particles with integer spin and half-integer spin respectively. The models recreate the same physical behavior as quantum field theory of free particles -- by using pure classical methods with three proper time. A new interpretation of spin is given. It provides us more evident that it is possible to interpret quantum physics by using multiple dimensional time. In the last part of this paper, Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi-Dirac statistics are derived under classical method.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: Promotion of quantum theory from a theory of measurement to a theory of reality requires an unambiguous specification of the ensemble of realizable states (and each state's probability of realization). Although not yet achieved within the framework of standard quantum theory, it has been achieved within the framework of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) wave function collapse model. In this paper, I consider a previously presented model, which is predictively equivalent to CSL. In this Completely Quantized Collapse (CQC) model, the classical random field which causes collapse in CSL is quantized. The ensemble of realizable states is described by a single state vector, the "ensemble vector," the sum of the direct product of an eigenstate of the quantized field and the CSL state corresponding to that eigenstate. Using this description, a long standing problem is resolved: it is shown how to define energy of the random field and its energy of interaction with particles so that total energy is conserved for the ensemble of realizable states. As a byproduct, since the random field energy spectrum is unbounded, its canonical conjugate, a self-adjoint time operator, is discussed. Finally, CSL is a phenomenological description, whose connection to, or derivation from, more conventional physics has not yet appeared. We suggest that, because CQC is fully quantized, it is a natural framework for replacement of the classical field of CSL by a quantized physical entity. Two illustrative examples are given.

abstract: A set of nonlocal correlations that have come to be known as a PR box suggest themselves as a natural unit of nonlocality, much as a singlet is a natural unit of entanglement. We present two results relevant to this idea. One is that a wide class of multipartite correlations can be simulated using local operations on PR boxes only. We show this with an explicit scheme, which has the interesting feature that the number of PR boxes required is related to the computational resources necessary to represent a function defining the multipartite box. The second result is that there are quantum multipartite correlations, arising from measurements on a cluster state, that cannot be simulated with n PR boxes, for any n.

abstract: Much of the theory of entanglement concerns the transformations that are possible to a state under local operations with classical communication (LOCC); however, this set of operations is complicated and difficult to describe mathematically. An idea which has proven very useful is that of the {\it entanglement monotone}: a function of the state which is invariant under local unitary transformations and always decreases (or increases) on average after any local operation. In this paper we look on LOCC as the set of operations generated by {\it infinitesimal local operations}, operations which can be performed locally and which leave the state little changed. We show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a function of the state to be an entanglement monotone under local operations that do not involve information loss is that the function be a monotone under infinitesimal local operations. We then derive necessary and sufficient differential conditions for a function of the state to be an entanglement monotone. We first derive two conditions for local operations without information loss, and then show that they can be extended to more general operations by adding the requirement of {\it convexity}. We then demonstrate that a number of known entanglement monotones satisfy these differential criteria. Finally, as an application, we use the differential conditions to construct a new polynomial entanglement monotone for three-qubit pure states. It is our hope that this approach will avoid some of the difficulties in the theory of multipartite and mixed-state entanglement.

abstract: In this paper we study the correlations that arise when two separated parties perform measurements on systems they hold locally. We restrict ourselves to those correlations with which arbitrarily fast transmission of information is impossible. These correlations are called nonsignaling. We allow the measurements to be chosen from sets of an arbitrary size, but promise that each measurement has only two possible outcomes. We find the structure of this convex set of nonsignaling correlations by characterizing its extreme points. Taking an information-theoretic view, we prove that all of these extreme correlations are interconvertible. This suggests that the simplest extremal nonlocal distribution (called a PR box) might be the basic unit of nonlocality. We also show that this unit of nonlocality is sufficient to simulate all quantum states when measured with two outcome measurements.

In our approach the evolution of the system is given by a family of completely positive trace preserving maps forming one-parameter dynamical semigroup. We give the Kraus representation for the general evolution of such systems which allows one to write the evolution for systems with two or more particles. Moreover, we show that the decay of the particle can be regarded as a Markov process by finding explicitly the master equation in the Lindblad form. We also show that there are remarkable restrictions on the possible strength of decoherence.

abstract: Arno Bohm and Ilya Prigogine's Brussels-Austin Group have been working on the quantum mechanical arrow of time and irreversibility in rigged Hilbert space quantum mechanics. A crucial notion in Bohm's approach is the so-called preparation/registration arrow. An analysis of this arrow and its role in Bohm's theory of scattering is given. Similarly, the Brussels-Austin Group uses an excitation/de-excitation arrow for ordering events, which is also analyzed. The relationship between the two approaches is initially discussed focusing on their semi-group operators and time arrows. Finally a possible realist interpretation of the rigged Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics is considered.

abstract: We discuss continuous observation of the momentum of a single atom by employing the high velocity sensitivity of the index of refraction in a driven $\Lambda$-system based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In the ideal limit of unit collection efficiency this provides a quantum limited measurement with minimal backaction on the atomic motion. A feedback loop, which drives the atom with a force proportional to measured signal, provides a cooling mechanism for the atomic motion. We derive the master equation which describes the feedback cooling and show that in the Lamb-Dicke limit the steady state energies are close to the ground state, limited only by the photon collection efficiency. Outside of the Lamb-Dicke regime the predicted temperatures are well below the Doppler limit.

abstract: The fundamental time-reversal invariance of dynamical systems can be broken in various ways. One way is based on the presence of resonances and their interactions giving rise to unstable dynamical systems, leading to well-defined time arrows. Associated with these time arrows are semigroups bearing time orientations. Usually, when time symmetry is broken, two time-oriented semigroups result, one directed toward the future and one directed toward the past. If time-reversed states and evolutions are excluded due to resonances, then the status of these states and their associated backwards-in-time oriented semigroups is open to question. One possible role for these latter states and semigroups is as an abstract representation of mental systems as opposed to material systems. The beginnings of this interpretation will be sketched.

abstract: We develop a theory of quantum feedback cooling of a single ion trapped in front of a mirror. By monitoring the motional sidebands of the light emitted into the mirror mode we infer the position of the ion, and act back with an appropriate force to cool the ion. We derive a feedback master equation along the lines of the quantum feedback theory developed by Wiseman and Milburn, which provides us with cooling times and final temperatures as a function of feedback gain and various system parameters.

abstract: The generation of entanglement produced by a local potential interaction in a bipartite system is investigated. The degree of entanglement is contrasted with the underlying classical dynamics for a Rydberg molecule (a charged particle colliding on a kicked top). Entanglement is seen to depend on the structure of classical phase-space rather than on the global dynamical regime. As a consequence regular classical dynamics can in certain circumstances be associated with higher entanglement generation than chaotic dynamics. In addition quantum effects also come into play: for example partial revivals, which are expected to persist in the semiclassical limit, affect the long time behaviour of the reduced linear entropy. These results suggest that entanglement may not be a pertinent universal signature of chaos.

abstract: We develop a formalism for distilling a classical key from a quantum state in a systematic way, expanding on our previous work on secure key from bound entanglement [K. Horodecki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005)]. More detailed proofs, discussion and examples are provided of the main results. Namely, we demonstrate that all quantum cryptographic protocols can be recast in a way which looks like entanglement theory, with the only change being that instead of distilling EPR pairs, the parties distill private states. The form of these general private states are given, and we show that there are a number of useful ways of expressing them. Some of the private states can be approximated by certain states which are bound entangled. Thus distillable entanglement is not a requirement for a private key. We find that such bound entangled states are useful for a cryptographic primitive we call a controlled private quantum channel. We also find a general class of states which have negative partial transpose (are NPT), but which appear to be bound entangled. The relative entropy distance is shown to be an upper bound on the rate of key. This allows us to compute the exact value of distillable key for a certain class of private states.

abstract: Genuine 3-qubit entanglement comes in two different inconvertible types represented by the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and the W state. We describe a specific method based on local positive operator valued measures and classical communication that can convert the ideal N-qubit GHZ state to a state arbitrarily close to the ideal N-qubit W state. We then experimentally implement this scheme in the 3-qubit case and characterize the input and the final state using 3-photon quantum state tomography.

abstract: The quantum dynamics of nonrelativistic single particle systems involving noncommutative coordinates, usually referred to as noncommutative quantum mechanics, has lately been the object of several investigations. In this note we pursue these studies for the case of multi-particle systems. We use as a prototype the degenerate electron gas whose dynamics is well known in the commutative limit. Our central aim here is to understand qualitatively, rather than quantitatively, the main modifications induced by the presence of noncommutative coordinates. We shall first see that the noncommutativity modifies the exchange correlation energy while preserving the electric neutrality of the model. By employing time-independent perturbation theory together with the Seiberg-Witten map we show, afterwards, that the ionization potential is modified by the noncommutativity. It also turns out that the noncommutative parameter acts as a reference temperature. Hence, the noncommutativity lifts the degeneracy of the zero temperature electron gas.

abstract: Finite size effects alter not only the energy levels of small systems, but can also lead to new effective interactions within these systems. Here the problem of low energy quantum scattering by a spherically symmetric short range potential in the presence of a general cylindrical confinement is investigated. A Green's function formalism is developed which accounts for the full 3D nature of the scattering potential by incorporating all phase-shifts and their couplings. This quasi-1D geometry gives rise to scattering resonances and weakly localized states, whose binding energies and wavefunctions can be systematically calculated. Possible applications include e.g. impurity scattering in ballistic quasi-1D quantum wires in mesoscopic systems and in atomic matter wave guides. In the particular case of parabolic confinement, the present formalism can also be applied to pair collision processes such as two-body interactions. Weakly bound pairs and quasi-molecules induced by the confinement and having zero or higher orbital angular momentum can be predicted, such as p- and d-wave pairings.

We consider an eavesdropping attack which uses a linear amplifier and beam splitter. This attack makes a link between beam-splitting attack and intercept-resend attack (classical teleportation attack). We also show how postselection loses its efficiency in a realistic channel.

abstract: We analyzed the security of the multiparty quantum secret sharing (MQSS) protocol recently proposed by Zhang, Li and Man [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{71}, 044301 (2005)] and found that this protocol is secure for any other eavesdropper except for the agent Bob who prepares the quantum signals as he can attack the quantum communication with a Trojan horse. That is, Bob replaces the single-photon signal with a multi-photon one and the other agent Charlie cannot find this cheating as she does not measure the photons before they runs back from the boss Alice, which reveals that this MQSS protocol is not secure for Bob. Finally, we present a possible improvement of the MQSS protocol security with two single-photon measurements and six unitary operations.

abstract: We prove additivity of the minimal conditional entropy associated with a quantum channel Phi, represented by a completely positive (CP), trace-preserving map, when the infimum of S(gamma_{12}) - S(gamma_1) is restricted to states of the form gamma_{12} = (I \ot Phi)(| psi >< psi |). We show that this follows from multiplicativity of the completely bounded norm of Phi considered as a map from L_1 -> L_p for L_p spaces defined by the Schatten p-norm on matrices; we also give an independent proof based on entropy inequalities. Several related multiplicativity results are discussed and proved. In particular, we show that both the usual L_1 -> L_p norm of a CP map and the corresponding completely bounded norm are achieved for positive semi-definite matrices. Physical interpretations are considered, and a new proof of strong subadditivity is presented.

abstract: The problem of estimating the spectrum of a density matrix is considered. Other problems, such as bipartite pure state entanglement, can be reduced to spectrum estimation. A local operations and classical communication (LOCC) measurement strategy is shown which is asymptotically optimal. This means that, for a very large number of copies, it becomes unnecessary to perform collective measurements which should be more difficult to implement in practice.

It is also expected that the introduction of a degree of non-locality in qubit gates will significantly improve the scaling fault-tolerant threshold over the nearest-neighbour linear array.

abstract: We analyze three important experimental domains (SQUIDs, molecular interferometry, and Bose-Einstein condensation) as well as quantum-biophysical studies of the neuronal apparatus to argue that (i) the universal validity of unitary dynamics and the superposition principle has been confirmed far into the mesoscopic and macroscopic realm in all experiments conducted thus far; (ii) all observed "restrictions" can be correctly and completely accounted for by taking into account environmental decoherence effects; (iii) no positive experimental evidence exists for physical state-vector collapse; (iv) the perception of single "outcomes" is likely to be explainable through decoherence effects in the neuronal apparatus. We also discuss recent progress in the understanding of the emergence of quantum probabilities and the objectification of observables. We conclude that it is not only viable, but moreover compelling to regard a minimal no-collapse quantum theory as a leading candidate for a physically motivated and empirically consistent interpretation of quantum mechanics.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)
url: http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0506201
abstract: We critically examine the internal consistency of a set of minimal assumptions entering the theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction for Markovian noise. These assumptions are: fast gates, a constant supply of fresh and cold ancillas, and a Markovian bath. We point out that these assumptions may not be mutually consistent in light of rigorous formulations of the Markovian approximation. Namely, Markovian dynamics requires either the singular coupling limit (high temperature), or the weak coupling limit (weak system-bath interaction). The former is incompatible with the assumption of a constant and fresh supply of cold ancillas, while the latter is inconsistent with fast gates. We discuss ways to resolve these inconsistencies. As part of our discussion we derive, in the weak coupling limit, a new master equation for a system subject to periodic driving.

Only two of the three important spin-projection orientations, parallel to the x-axis or to the y-axis, are suited to the torus-lattice system. The infinitesimal difference of the free-energies of the systems between the two systems mentioned above makes their critical temperatures infinitely close to each other, but their topological fundamental groups are distinct.

abstract: We provide a class of bound entangled states that have positive distillable secure key rate. The smallest state of this kind is $4 \otimes 4$, which shows that peculiar security contained in bound entangled states does not need high dimensional systems. We show, that for these states a positive key rate can be obtained by {\it one-way} Devetak-Winter protocol. Subsequently the volume of bound entangled key-distillable states in arbitrary dimension is shown to be nonzero. We provide a scheme of verification of cryptographic quality of experimentally prepared state in terms of local observables. Proposed set of 7 collective settings is proven to be optimal in number of settings.

The energy eigenvalues are obtained without having to solve for the corresponding eigenfunctions explicitly. We also demonstrate how to find the eigenfunctions through this method.

We can treat mesoscopic environments (10^5 particles). We present results for a lattice gas, which could be realized by neutral atoms hopping in an optical lattice, and show the effects of non-Markovian and correlated noise, as well as finite size effects.

Depending on the strength of a control field it is possible to obtain a significant reduction of the light velocity in a narrow frequency window in the conditions of a small absorption. A smooth transition is shown between the case of a flat continuum and that of a discrete state serving as the upper state of a Lambda system.

abstract: This paper explores the connections between particle scattering and quantum information theory in the context of the non-relativistic, elastic scattering of two spin-1/2 particles. An untangled, pure, two-particle in-state is evolved by an S-matrix that respects certain symmetries and the entanglement of the pure out-state is measured. The analysis is phrased in terms of unitary, irreducible representations (UIRs) of the symmetry group in question, either the rotation group for the spin degrees of freedom or the Galilean group for non-relativistic particles. Entanglement may occurs when multiple UIRs appear in the direct sum decomposition of the direct product in-state, but it also depends of the scattering phase shifts. \keywords{dynamical entanglement, scattering, Clebsch-Gordan methods}

abstract: It is a central trait of quantum information theory that there exist limitations to the free sharing of quantum correlations among multiple parties. Such 'monogamy constraints' have been introduced in a landmark paper by Coffman, Kundu and Wootters, who derived a quantitative inequality expressing a trade-off between the couplewise and the genuine tripartite entanglement for states of three qubits. Since then, a lot of efforts have been devoted to the investigation of distributed entanglement in multipartite quantum systems. In these proceedings we report, in a unifying framework, a bird's eye view of the most relevant results that have been established so far on entanglement sharing in quantum systems. We will take off from the domain of N qubits, graze qudits, and finally land in the almost unexplored territory of multimode Gaussian states of continuous variable systems.

abstract: We study the quantum mechanical motion in the $x^2y^2$ potentials with $n=2,3$, which arise in the spatially homogeneous limit of the Yang-Mills (YM) equations. These systems show strong stochasticity in the classical limit ($\hbar = 0$) and exhibit a quantum mechanical confinement feature. We calculate the partition function $Z(t)$ going beyond the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation by means of the semiclassical expansion using the Wigner-Kirkwood (WK) method. We derive a novel compact form of the differential equation for the WK function. After separating the motion in the channels of the equipotential surface from the motion in the central region, we show that the leading higher-order corrections to the TF term vanish up to eighth order in $\hbar$, if we treat the quantum motion in the hyperbolic channels correctly by adiabatic separation of the degrees of freedom. Finally, we obtain an asymptotic expansion of the partition function in terms of the parameter $g^2\hbar^4t^3$.

abstract: We investigate a scheme of atomic quantum memory to store photonic qubits in cavity QED. This is motivated on the recent observation that the quantum-state swapping between a single-photon pulse and a Lambda-type atom trapped in a cavity is ideally realized via scattering for some specific case in the strong coupling cavity regime [T. W. Chen, C. K. Law, and P. T. Leung, Phys. Rev. A 69, 063810 (2004)]. We derive a simple formula for calculating the fidelity of this atom-photon swapping for quantum memory. We further propose a feasible method which implements conditionally the quantum memory operation with the fidelity of almost unity even if the atom-photon coupling is not so strong. This method can also be applied to store a photonic entanglement in spatially separated atomic quantum memories.

It is shown that the pair cat states can always be distillable in the phase damping channel. Furthermore, we analyze the fidelity of teleportation for the pair cat states by using joint measurements of the photon-number sum and phase difference.

The algorithm explores multiple evolutionary branches by superposition of states, and does not require the coin toss instruction of classical randomised algorithms. We use this algorithm to search for a marked vertex on a hypercubic lattice in arbitrary dimensions. Our numerical and analytical results match the scaling behaviour of earlier algorithms that use a coin toss instruction.

abstract: Gibbons et al. [Phys. Rev. A 70, 062101(2004)] have recently defined a class of discrete Wigner functions W to represent quantum states in a Hilbert space with finite dimension. We show that the only pure states having non-negative W for all such functions are stabilizer states, as conjectured by one of us [Phys. Rev. A 71, 042302 (2005)]. We also show that the unitaries preserving non-negativity of W for all definitions of W form a subgroup of the Clifford group. This means pure states with non-negative W and their associated unitary dynamics are classical in the sense of admitting an efficient classical simulation scheme using the stabilizer formalism.

Our estimation procedure does not assume prior knowledge of the absolute spatial orientation of the systems and as such does not require information on the underlying classical reference frame in which the states are prepared.

abstract: We investigate the structure of SO(3)-invariant quantum systems which are composed of two particles with spins j_1 and j_2. The states of the composite spin system are represented by means of two complete sets of rotationally invariant operators, namely by the projections P_J onto the eigenspaces of the total angular momentum J, and by certain invariant operators Q_K which are built out of spherical tensor operators of rank K. It is shown that these representations are connected by an orthogonal matrix whose elements are expressible in terms of Wigner's 6-j symbols. The operation of the partial time reversal of the combined spin system is demonstrated to be diagonal in the Q_K-representation. These results are employed to obtain a complete characterization of spin systems with j_1 = 1 and arbitrary j_2 > 1. We prove that the Peres-Horodecki criterion of positive partial transposition (PPT) is necessary and sufficient for separability if j_2 is an integer, while for half-integer spins j_2 there always exist entangled PPT states (bound entanglement). We construct an optimal entanglement witness for the case of half-integer spins and design a protocol for the detection of entangled PPT states through measurements of the total angular momentum.

abstract: Any Bell test consists of a sequence of measurements on a quantum state in space-like separated regions. Thus, a state is better than others for a Bell test when, for the optimal measurements and the same number of trials, the probability of existence of a local model for the observed outcomes is smaller. The maximization over states and measurements defines the optimal nonlocality proof. Numerical results show that the required optimal state does not have to be maximally entangled.

subjects: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

abstract: This communication is an enquiry into the circumstances under which concurrence and phase entropy methods can give an answer to the question of quantum entanglement in the composite state when the photonic band gap is exhibited by the presence of photonic crystals in a three-level system. An analytic approach is proposed for any three-level system in the presence of photonic band gap. Using this analytic solution, we conclusively calculate the concurrence and phase entropy, focusing particularly on the entanglement phenomena. Specifically, we use concurrence as a measure of entanglement for dipole emitters situated in the thin slab region between two semi-infinite one-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals, a situation reminiscent of planar cavity laser structures. One feature of the regime considered here is that closed-form evaluation of the time evolution may be carried out in the presence of the detuning and the photonic band gap, which provides insight into the difference in the nature of the concurrence function for atom-field coupling, mode frequency and different cavity parameters. We demonstrate how fluctuations in the phase and number entropies effected by the presence of the photonic-band-gap. The outcomes are illustrated with numerical simulations applied to GaAs. Finally, we relate the obtained results to instances of any three-level system for which the entanglement cost can be calculated. Potential experimental observations in solid-state systems are discussed and found to be promising.

abstract: We introduce a general scheme to realize perfect quantum state reconstruction and storage in systems of interacting qubits. This novel approach is based on the idea of controlling the residual interactions by suitable external controls that, acting on the inter-qubit couplings, yield time-periodic inversions in the dynamical evolution, thus cancelling exactly the effects of quantum state diffusion. We illustrate the method for spin systems on closed rings with XY residual interactions, showing that it enables the massive storage of arbitrarily large numbers of local states, and we demonstrate its robustness against several realistic sources of noise and imperfections.

abstract: Decoherence may not solve all of the measurement problems of quantum mechanics. It is proposed that a solution to these problems may be to allow that superpositions describe physically real systems in the following sense. Each quantum system "carries" around a local spacetime in whose terms other quantum systems may take on nonlocal states. Each quantum system forms a physically valid coordinate frame. The laws of physics should be formulated to be invariant under the group of allowed transformations among such frames. A transformation of relatively superposed spatial coordinates that allows an electron system to preserve the de Broglie Relation in describing a double-slit laboratory system-in analogy to a Minkowskian Transformation-is proposed. In general, "quantum relativity" says is invariant under transformations among quantum reference frames. Some conjectures on how this impacts gravity and gauge invariance are made.

abstract: We consider the maximum bipartite entanglement that can be distilled from a single copy of a multipartite mixed entangled state, where we focus mostly on $d\times d\times n$-dimensional tripartite mixed states. We show that this {\em assisted entanglement}, when measured in terms of the generalized concurrence (named G-concurrence) is (tightly) bounded by an entanglement monotone, which we call the G-concurrence of assistance. The G-concurrence is one of the possible generalizations of the concurrence to higher dimensions, and for pure bipartite states it measures the {\em geometric mean} of the Schmidt numbers. For a large (non-trivial) class of $d\times d$-dimensional mixed states, we are able to generalize Wootters formula for the concurrence into lower and upper bounds on the G-concurrence. Moreover, we have found an explicit formula for the G-concurrence of assistance that generalizes the expression for the concurrence of assistance for a large class of $d\times d\times n$ dimensional tripartite pure states.

abstract: The photon is modeled as a monochromatic solution of Maxwell's equations confined as a soliton wave by the principle of causality of special relativity. The soliton travels rectilinearly at the speed of light. The solution can represent any of the known polarization (spin) states of the photon. For circularly polarized states the soliton's envelope is a circular ellipsoid whose length is the observed wavelength ($\lambda$), and whose diameter is $\lambda/\pi$; this envelope contains the electromagnetic energy of the wave ($h\nu=hc/\lambda$). The predicted size and shape is confirmed by experimental measurements: of the sub-picosecond time delay of the photo-electric effect, of the attenuation of undiffracted transmission through slits narrower than the soliton's diameter of $\lambda/\pi$, and by the threshold intensity required for the onset of multiphoton absorption in focussed laser beams. Inside the envelope the wave's amplitude increases linearly with the radial distance from the axis of propagation, being zero on the axis. Outside the envelope the wave is evanescent with an amplitude that decreases inversely with the radial distance from the axis. The evanescent wave is responsible for the observed double-slit interference phenomenon.

This transition has a linear Stark shift and we induce inhomogeneous broadening by applying an external electric field gradient. After optical excitation, reversing the polarity of the field rephases the ensemble, resulting in a photon echo. This is the first demonstration of such a photon echo and its application as a quantum memory is discussed.

abstract: We report on the demonstration of light storage for times greater than a second in praseodymium doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ using electromagnetically induced transparency. The long storage times were enabled by the long coherence times possible for the hyperfine transitions in this material. The use of a solid state system also enabled operation with the probe and coupling beam counter propagating, allowing easy separation of the two beams. The efficiency of the storage was low because of the low optical thickness of the sample, as is discussed this deficiency should be easy to rectify.

In contrast to other micro-resonators, such as microspheres, the structure we have built gives atoms and molecules direct access to the high-intensity part of the field mode, enabling them to interact strongly with photons in the cavity for the purposes of detection and quantum-coherent manipulation. Light couples directly in and out of the resonator through an optical fibre, avoiding the need for sensitive coupling optics. This renders the cavity particularly attractive as a component of a lab-on-a-chip, and as a node in a quantum network.

abstract: We investigate entanglement between collective operators of two blocks of oscillators in an infinite linear harmonic chain. These operators are defined as averages over local operators (individual oscillators) in the blocks. On the one hand, this approach of "physical blocks" meets realistic experimental conditions, where measurement apparatuses do not interact with single oscillators but rather with a whole bunch of them, i.e., where in contrast to usually studied "mathematical blocks" not every possible measurement is allowed. On the other, this formalism naturally allows the generalization to blocks which may consist of several non-contiguous regions. We quantify entanglement between the collective operators by a measure based on the Peres-Horodecki criterion and show how it can be extracted and transferred to two qubits. Entanglement between two blocks is found even in the case where none of the oscillators from one block is entangled with an oscillator from the other, showing genuine bipartite entanglement between collective operators. Allowing the blocks to consist of a periodic sequence of subblocks, we verify that entanglement scales at most with the total boundary region. We also apply the approach of collective operators to scalar quantum field theory.

abstract: We discuss the effects caused by a resonant cavity around a sample of a magnetic molecular crystal (such as Mn${}_{12}$-Ac), when a time dependent external magnetic field is applied parallel to the easy axis of the crystal. We show that the back action of the cavity field on the sample significantly increases the possibility of microwave emission. This radiation process can be supperradiance or a maser-like effect, depending on the strength of the dephasing. Our model provides further insight to the theoretical understanding of the bursts of electromagnetic radiation observed in recent experiments accompanying the resonant quantum tunneling of magnetization. The experimental findings up to now can all be explained as being a maser effect rather than superradiance. The results of our theory scale similarly to the experimental findings, i.e., with increasing sweep rate of the external magnetic field, the emission peaks are shifted towards higher field values.

abstract: The equality in the uncertainty principle for linear momentum and position is obtained for states which also minimize the uncertainty product. However, in the uncertainty relation for angular momentum and angular position both sides of the inequality are state dependent and therefore the intelligent states, which satisfy the equality, do not necessarily give a minimum for the uncertainty product. In this paper, we highlight the difference between intelligent states and minimum uncertainty states by investigating a class of intelligent states which obey the equality in the angular uncertainty relation while having an arbitrarily large uncertainty product. To develop an understanding for the uncertainties of angle and angular momentum for the large-uncertainty intelligent states we compare exact solutions with analytical approximations in two limiting cases.

abstract: We continue our study of the quantum mechanical motion in the $x^2y^2$ potentials for $n=2,3$, which arise in the spatially homogeneous limit of the Yang-Mills (YM) equations. In the present paper, we develop a new approach to the calculation of the partition function $Z(t)$ beyond the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation by adding a harmonic (Higgs) potential and taking the limit $v\to 0$, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. Using the Wigner-Kirkwood method to calculate higher-order corrections in $\hbar$, we show that the limit $v\to 0$ leads to power-like singularities of the type $v^{-n}$, which reflect the possibility of escape of the particle along the channels in the classical limit. We show how these singularities can be eliminated by taking into account the quantum fluctuations dictated by the form of the potential.

abstract: The violation of local uncertainty relations is a valuable tool for detecting entanglement, especially in multi-dimensional systems. The orbital angular momentum of light provides such a multi-dimensional system. We study quantum correlations for the conjugate variables of orbital angular momentum and angular position. We determine an experimentally testable criterion for the demonstration of an angular version of the EPR paradox. For the interpretation of future experimental results from our proposed setup, we include a model for the indeterminacies inherent to the angular position measurement. For this measurement angular apertures are used to determine the probability density of the angle. We show that for a class of aperture functions a demonstration of an angular EPR paradox, according to our criterion, is to be expected.

abstract: The group of local unitary transformations acts on the space of n-qubit pure states, decomposing it into orbits. In a previous paper we proved that a product of singlet states (together with an unentangled qubit for a system with an odd number of qubits) achieves the smallest possible orbit dimension, equal to 3n/2 for n even and (3n + 1)/2 for n odd, where n is the number of qubits. In this paper we show that any state with minimum orbit dimension must be of this form, and furthermore, such states are classified up to local unitary equivalence by the sets of pairs of qubits entangled in singlets.

abstract: In this thesis we study the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave interpretation of quantum theory. We consider the domain of non-relativistic quantum theory, relativistic quantum theory and quantum field theory, and in each domain we consider the possibility of formulating a pilot-wave interpretation. For non-relativistic quantum theory a pilot-wave interpretation in terms of particle beables can readily be formulated. But this interpretation can in general not straightforwardly be generalized to relativistic wave equations. The problems which prevent us from devising a pilot-wave interpretation for relativistic wave equations also plague the standard quantum mechanical interpretation, where these problems led to the conception of quantum field theory. Therefore most of our attention is focussed on the construction of a pilot-wave interpretation for quantum field theory. We thereby favour the field beable approach, developed amongst others by Bohm, Hiley, Holland, Kaloyerou and Valentini. Although the field beable approach can be successfully applied to bosonic quantum field theory, it seems not straightforward to do so for fermionic quantum field theory.

abstract: We review and analyze the hybrid quantum-classical NMR computing methodology referred to as Type-II quantum computing. We show that all such algorithms considered so far within this paradigm are equivalent to some classical lattice-Boltzmann scheme. We derive a sufficient and necessary constraint on the unitary operator representing the quantum mechanical part of the computation which ensures that the model reproduces the Boltzmann approximation of a lattice-gas model satisfying semi-detailed balance. Models which do not satisfy this constraint represent new lattice-Boltzmann schemes which cannot be formulated as the average over some underlying lattice gas. We close the paper with some discussion of the strengths, weaknesses and possible future direction of Type-II quantum computing.

abstract: This paper provides a security proof of the Bennett-Brassard (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol in practical implementation. To prove the security, it is not assumed that defects in the devices are absorbed into an adversary's attack. In fact, the only assumption in the proof is that the source is characterized. The proof is performed by lower-bounding adversary's Renyi entropy about the key before privacy amplification. The bound reveals the leading factors reducing the key generation rate.

abstract: The effect of entanglement on off-diagonal geometric phases is investigated in the paper. Two spin-1/2 particles in magnetic fields along the $y$ direction are taken as an example. Three parameters (the purity of state $r$, the mixing angle $\theta$ and the relative phase $\beta$) are chosen to characterize the initial states. The nodal points at which the usual geometric phases disappear are calculated and illustrated as a function of the three parameters.

abstract: The oracle model of computation is believed to allow a rigorous proof of quantum over classical computational superiority. Since quantum and classical oracles are essentially different, a correspondence principle is commonly implicitly used as a platform for comparison of oracle complexity. Here, we question the grounds on which this correspondence is based. Obviously, results on quantum speed-up depend on the chosen correspondence. So, we introduce the notion of genuine quantum speed-up which can serve as a tool for reliable comparison of quantum vs classical complexity, independently of the chosen correspondence principle.

Here we extend this model by several types of interactions leading to a nonhermitian operator which doesn't satisfy the physical condition of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry). However the new Hamiltonians are either exactly solvable admitting an entirely real spectrum or quasi exactly solvable with a real algebraic part of their spectrum.

abstract: We introduce the single-copy entanglement as a quantity to assess quantum correlations in the ground state in quantum many-body systems. We show for a large class of models that already on the level of single specimens of spin chains, criticality is accompanied with the possibility of distilling a maximally entangled state of arbitrary dimension from a sufficiently large block deterministically, with local operations and classical communication. These analytical results -- which refine previous results on the divergence of block entropy as the rate at which EPR pairs can be distilled from many identically prepared chains, and which apply to single systems as encountered in actual experimental situations -- are made quantitative for general isotropic translationally invariant spin chains that can be mapped onto a quasi-free fermionic system, and for the anisotropic XY model. For the XX model, we provide the asymptotic scaling of ~(1/6) log_2(L), and contrast it with the block entropy. The role of superselection rules on single-copy entanglement in systems consisting of indistinguishable particles is emphasized.

abstract: On a family of classical dynamical systems on the 2-torus, we perform a discretization procedure similar to the Anti-Wick quantization. Such a discretization is performed by using a particular class of states, fulfilling an appropriate dynamical localization property, typical of quantum Coherent States. The same set of states is involved in the construction of a quantum entropy, that we test on the discrete approximants; a correspondence with the classical metric entropy of Kolmogorov-Sinai is found only over time scales that are logarithmic in the discretization parameter.

abstract: A quantum password is a quantum mechanical analogue of the classical password. Our proposal is completely quantum mechanical in nature, i.e. at no point is information stored and manipulated classically. We show that, in contrast to quantum protocols that encode classical information, we are able to prevent the distribution of reusable passwords even when Alice actively cooperates with Eve. This allows us to confront and address security issues that are unavoidable in classical protocols.

Lett. 93, 140408 (2004)] using recently developed numerical methods. In this setup, a localised spin 1/2 impurity is used to switch the transport of atoms in a 1D optical lattice: in one state the impurity is transparent to probe atoms, but in the other acts as a single atom mirror. We calculate time-dependent currents for bosons passing the impurity atom, and find interesting many body effects. These include substantially different transport properties for bosons in the strongly interacting (Tonks) regime when compared with fermions, and an unexpected decrease in the current when weakly interacting probe atoms are initially accelerated to a non-zero mean momentum. We also provide more insight into the application of our numerical methods to this system, and discuss open questions about the currents approached by the system on long timescales.

abstract: We propose an effective method to optimize the working parameters (WPs) of microwave-driven quantum logical gates implemented with multi-level physical qubits. We show that by treating transitions between each pair of levels independently, intrinsic gate errors due primarily to population leakage to undesired states can be estimated accurately from spectroscopic properties of the qubits and minimized by choosing appropriate WPs. The validity and efficiency of the approach are demonstrated by applying it to optimize the WPs of two coupled rf SQUID flux qubits for controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation. The result of this independent transition approximation (ITA) is in good agreement with that of dynamic method (DM). Furthermore, the ratio of the speed of ITA to that of DM scales exponentially as 2^n when the number of qubits n increases.

abstract: In this paper we investigate decoherence times of a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit due to it coupling with acoustic phonon baths. We individually consider the acoustic piezoelectric as well as deformation coupling phonon baths in the qubit environment. The decoherence times are calculated with two kinds of methods. One of them is based on the qusiadiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI) and the other is based on Bloch equations, and two kinds of results are compared. It is shown that the theoretical decoherence times of the DQD charge qubit are shorter than the experimental reported results. It implies that the phonon couplings to the qubit play a subordinate role, resulting in the decoherence of the qubit.

abstract: In Quantum Information Processing by NMR one of the major challenges is relaxation or decoherence. Often it is found that the equilibrium mixed state of a spin system is not suitable as an initial state for computation and a definite initial state is required to be prepared prior to the computation. As these preferred initial states are non-equilibrium states, they are not stationary and are destroyed with time as the spin system relaxes toward its equilibrium, introducing error in computation. Since it is not possible to cut off the relaxation processes completely, attempts are going on to develop alternate strategies like Quantum Error Correction Codes or Noiseless Subsystems. Here we study the relaxation behavior of various Pseudo Pure States and analyze the role of Cross terms between different relaxation processes, known as Cross-correlation. It is found that while cross-correlations accelerate the relaxation of certain pseudo pure states, they retard that of others.

abstract: A private shared Cartesian frame is a novel form of private shared correlation that allows for both private classical and quantum communication. Cryptography using a private shared Cartesian frame has the remarkable property that asymptotically, if perfect privacy is demanded, the private classical capacity is three times the private quantum capacity. We demonstrate that if the requirement for perfect privacy is relaxed, then it is possible to use the properties of random subspaces to nearly triple the private quantum capacity, almost closing the gap between the private classical and quantum capacities.

abstract: We demonstrate that in a coupled two-qubit system any single-qubit gate can be decomposed into two conditional two-qubit gates and that any conditional two-qubit gate can be implemented by a manipulation analogous to that used for a controlled two-qubit gate. Based on this we present a unified approach to implement universal single-qubit and two-qubit gates in a coupled two-qubit system with fixed always-on coupling. This approach requires neither supplementary circuit or additional physical qubits to control the coupling nor extra hardware to adjust the energy level structure. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by numerical simulation of single-qubit gates and creation of two-qubit Bell states in rf-driven inductively coupled two SQUID flux qubits with realistic device parameters and constant always-on coupling.

We also demonstrate a fully-resolving, nondeterministic optical Bell-state analyser based on this controlled-Z gate. This new architecture is ideally suited to guided optics implementations of optical gates.

The complexity (in terms of k) of this problem was first considered by Pak, who gave a randomized algorithm involving O(k) group operations. We construct a quite optimal quantum algorithm for this problem whose complexity is in O (k^{2/3}). The algorithm uses and highlights the power of the quantization method of Szegedy. For the lower bound of Omega(k^{2/3}), we give a reduction from a special case of Element Distinctness to our problem. Along the way, we prove the optimality of the algorithm of Pak for the randomized model.

There are two advantages to our approach - our measure of second quantized Kolmogorov complexity is closer to physical reality and unlike other quantum Kolmogorov complexities it is continuous. We give examples where second quantized and quantum Kolmogorov complexity differ.

abstract: We derive the optimal input states and the optimal quantum measurements for estimating the unitary action of a given symmetry group, showing how the optimal performance is obtained with a suitable use of entanglement. Optimality is defined in a Bayesian sense, as minimization of the average value of a given cost function. We introduce a class of cost functions that generalizes the Holevo class for phase estimation, and show that for states of the optimal form all functions in such a class lead to the same optimal measurement. A first application of the main result is the complete proof of the optimal efficiency in the transmission of a Cartesian reference frame. As a second application, we derive the optimal estimation of a completely unknown two-qubit maximally entangled state, provided that N copies of the state are available. In the limit of large N, the fidelity of the optimal estimation is shown to be 1-3/(4N).

abstract: In an N-level quantum mechanical system, the problem of unitary feedback stabilization of mixed density operators to periodic orbits admits a natural Lyapunov-based time-varying feedback design. A global description of the domain of attraction of the closed-loop system can be provided based on a ``root-space''-like structure of the space of density operators. This convex set foliates as a complex flag manifold where each leaf is identified with the coadjoint orbit of the eigenvalues of the density operator. The converging conditions are time-independent but depend from the topology of the flag manifold: it is shown that the closed loop must have a number of equilibria at least equal to the Euler characteristic of the manifold, thus imposing obstructions of topological nature to global stabilizability.

The improved quality of the gate is evaluated by analysing its entangling capability and by performing full process tomography. The achieved results ensure that this device is well suited for implementation in various multi photon quantum information protocols.

abstract: What is the simplest Hamiltonian which can implement quantum computation without requiring any control operations during the computation process? In a previous paper we have constructed a 10-local finite-range interaction among qubits on a 2D lattice having this property. Here we show that pair-interactions among qutrits on a 2D lattice are sufficient, too, and can also implement an ergodic computer where the result can be read out from the time average state after some post-selection with high success probability. Two of the 3 qutrit states are given by the two levels of a spin-1/2 particle located at a specific lattice site, the third state is its absence. Usual hopping terms together with an attractive force among adjacent particles induce a coupled quantum walk where the particle spins are subjected to spatially inhomogeneous interactions implementing holonomic quantum computing. The holonomic method ensures that the implemented circuit does not depend on the time needed for the walk. Even though the implementation of the required type of spin-spin interactions is currently unclear, the model shows that quite simple Hamiltonians are powerful enough to allow for universal quantum computing in a closed physical system.

However, it has been recently shown by several researchers that this is not necessarily the case. When the change in the vacuum energy was calculated for a time independent perturbation HT and QFT yielded different results. In this paper we extend this discussion to include a time dependent perturbation for which the exact solution to the Dirac equation is known. It will be shown that for this case, also, HT and QFT yield different results. In addition, there will be some discussion of the problem of anomalies in QFT.

abstract: We identify an optical signature for detecting entanglement in experimental nanostructure systems comprising coupled excitonic qubits. This signature owes its strength to non-Markovian dynamical effects in the second-order temporal coherence function of the emitted radiation. We calculate autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions for both selective and collective light excitation, and prove that the coherence properties of the emitted light do indeed carry information about the entanglement of the initial multi-qubit state. We also show that this signature can survive in the presence of a noisy environment.

The Mott lobes present an even or odd asymmetry associated to the boson filling. We show that for odd fillings the insulating phase is always in a dimerized state. The results obtained in this work are also relevant for the determination of the ground state phase diagram of the S=1 Heisenberg model with biquadratic interaction.

Near {\bf 0 K} we find a universal logarithmic behavior (valid for times longer than the relaxation time), and deviations from classical behavior can also be significant at larger values of time and temperature. Our derivation depends neither on the specific composition of the heat bath nor on the strength of the coupling between the bath and the particle. An experimental regime of microseconds and microdegrees Kelvin would elicit the pure logarithmic diffusion.

Additionally, this technique provides a limit for the presence of non-Newtonian gravity forces in the ~1 micron range.

We point out possible signatures of a Bose-Einstein condensate -- Tonks crossover in shock dynamics. Our findings can be directly verified in different experimental setups.

A perturbative theoretical approach and numerical study of its ground state is performed that reveals a rich variety of phases and criticalities. We identify phases with periodicity one, two or three, as well as critical points that belong in the same universality class as the Ising or the three-state Potts model. We establish a range of parameters, corresponding to a large degeneracy present between phases with period 2 and 3, that nests a gapless incommensurate chiral phase.

abstract: We solve the two-particle s-wave scattering problem for ultracold atom gases confined in arbitrary quasi-one-dimensional trapping potentials, allowing for two different atom species. As a consequence, the center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedom do not factorize. We derive bound-state solutions and obtain the general scattering solution, which exhibits several resonances in the 1D scattering length induced by the confinement. We apply our formalism to two experimentally relevant cases: (i) interspecies scattering in a two-species mixture, and (ii) the two-body problem for a single species in a non-parabolic trap.

abstract: We present an approach that allows quantifying decoherence processes in an open quantum system subject to external time-dependent control. Interactions with the environment are modeled by a standard bosonic heat bath. We develop two unitarity-preserving approximation schemes to calculate the reduced density matrix. One of the approximations relies on a short-time factorization of the evolution operator, while the other utilizes expansion in terms of the system-bath coupling strength. Applications are reported for two illustrative systems: an exactly solvable adiabatic model, and a model of a rotating-wave quantumcomputing gate function. The approximations are found to produce consistent results at short and intermediate times.

abstract: We introduce and analyze the physics of "driving reversal" experiments. These are prototype wavepacket dynamics scenarios probing quantum irreversibility. Unlike the mostly hypothetical "time reversal" concept, a "driving reversal" scenario can be realized in a laboratory experiment, and is relevant to the theory of quantum dissipation. We study both the energy spreading and the survival probability in such experiments. We also introduce and study the "compensation time" (time of maximum return) in such a scenario. Extensive effort is devoted to figuring out the capability of either Linear Response Theory (LRT) or Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in order to describe specific features of the time evolution. We explain that RMT modeling leads to a strong non-perturbative response effect that differs from the semiclassical behavior.

abstract: A comparative analysis is given of spin superradiance and atomic superradiance. Their similarities and distinctions are emphasized. It is shown that, despite a close analogy, these phenomena are fundamentally different. In atomic systems, superradiance is a self-organized process, in which both the initial cause, being spontaneous emission, as well as the collectivizing mechanism of their interactions through the common radiation field, are of the same physical nature. Contrary to this, in actual spin systems with dipole interactions, the latter are the major reason for spin motion. Electromagnetic spin interactions through radiation are negligible and can never produce collective effects. The possibility of realizing superradiance in molecular magnets by coupling them to a resonant circuit is discussed.

abstract: We solve the Schroedinger equation for an interacting spin-chain locally coupled to a quantum environment with a specific degeneracy structure. The reduced dynamics of the whole spin-chain as well as of single spins is analyzed. We show, that the total spin-chain relaxes to a thermal equilibrium state independently of the internal interaction strength. In contrast, the asymptotic states of each individual spin are thermal for weak but non-thermal for stronger spin-spin coupling. The transition between both scenarios is found for couplings of the order of $0.1 \times \Delta E$, with $\Delta E$ denoting the Zeeman-splitting. We compare these results with a master equation treatment; when time averaged, both approaches lead to the same asymptotic state and finally with analytical results.

abstract: The high-temperature aspects of the Casimir force between two neutral conducting walls are studied. The mathematical model of "inert" ideal-conductor walls, considered in the original formulations of the Casimir effect, is based on the universal properties of the electromagnetic radiation in the vacuum between the conductors, with zero boundary conditions for the tangential components of the electric field on the walls. This formulation seems to be in agreement with experiments on metallic conductors at room temperature. At high temperatures or large distances, at least, fluctuations of the electric field are present in the bulk and at the surface of a particle system forming the walls, even in the high-density limit: "living" ideal conductors. This makes the enforcement of the inert boundary conditions inadequate. Within a hierarchy of length scales, the high-temperature Casimir force is shown to be entirely determined by the thermal fluctuations in the conducting walls, modelled microscopically by classical Coulomb fluids in the Debye-H\"{u}ckel regime. The semi-classical regime, in the framework of quantum electrodynamics, is studied in the companion letter by P.R.Buenzli and Ph.A.Martin, cond-mat/0506363, Europhys.Lett.72, 42 (2005).

abstract: In a Luttinger liquid phase of one-dimensional molecular matter the strength of zero-point motion can be characterized by dimensionless De Boer's number quantifying the interplay of quantum fluctuations and two-body interactions. Selecting the latter in the Morse form we show that dissociation of the Luttinger liquid is a process initiated at the system edge. The latter becomes unstable against quantum fluctuations at a value of De Boer's number which is smaller than that of the bulk instability which parallels the classical phenomenon of surface melting.

We predict the existence of an Anderson-like insulator with sharp mobility edges in a one-dimensional nearly-periodic optical lattice. We show that the mobility edge manifests itself as the early onset of pinning in center of mass dipole oscillations in the presence of a magnetic trap which should be observable in optical lattices.

abstract: A spin 1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number $\nu$. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to $\nu=0$ and $\nu=\pm 1$, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on $\nu\bmod 16$, whereas $\nu$ itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices.

abstract: We investigate the influence that classical dynamics has on interference patterns in coherence experiments. We calculate the time-integrated probability current through an absorbing screen and the conductance through a doubly connected ballistic cavity, both in an Aharonov-Bohm geometry with forward scattering only. We show how interference fringes in the probability current generically disappear in the case of a chaotic system with small openings, and how they may persist in the case of an integrable cavity. Simultaneously, the typical, sample dependent amplitude of the flux-sensitive part $g(\phi)$ of the conductance survives in all cases, and becomes universal in the case of a chaotic cavity. In presence of dephasing by fluctuations of the electric potential in one arm of the Aharonov-Bohm loop, we find an exponential damping of the flux-dependent part of the conductance, $g(\phi) \propto \exp[-\tau_{\rm L}/\tau_\phi]$, in term of the traversal time $\tau_{\rm L}$ through the arm and the dephasing time $\tau_\phi$. This extends previous works on dephasing in ballistic systems to the case of many conducting channels.

abstract: We consider dynamical stabilization of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) by time-dependent modulation of the scattering length. The problem has been studied before by several methods: Gaussian variational approximation, the method of moments, method of modulated Townes soliton, and the direct averaging of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. We summarize these methods and find that the numerically obtained stabilized solution has different configuration than that assumed by the theoretical methods (in particular a phase of the wavefunction is not quadratic with $r$). We show that there is presently no clear evidence for stabilization in a strict sense, because in the numerical experiments only metastable (slowly decaying) solutions have been obtained. In other words, neither numerical nor mathematical evidence for a new kind of soliton solutions have been revealed so far. The existence of the metastable solutions is nevertheless an interesting and complicated phenomenon on its own. We try some non-Gaussian variational trial functions to obtain better predictions for the critical nonlinearity $g_{cr}$ for metastabilization but other dynamical properties of the solutions remain difficult to predict.

abstract: A general theory is developed for describing the nonlinear relaxation of spin systems from a strongly nonequilibrium initial state, when, in addition, the sample is coupled to a resonator. Such processes are characterized by nonlinear stochastic differential equations. This makes these strongly nonequilibrium processes principally different from the spin relaxation close to an equilibrium state, which is represented by linear differential equations. The consideration is based on a realistic microscopic Hamiltonian including the Zeeman terms, dipole interactions, exchange interactions, and a single-site anisotropy. The influence of cross correlations between several spin species is investigated. The critically important function of coupling between the spin system and a resonant electric circuit is emphasized. The role of all main relaxation rates is analyzed. The phenomenon of self-organization of transition coherence in spin motion, from the quantum chaotic stage of incoherent fluctuations, is thoroughly described. Local spin fluctuations are found to be the triggering cause for starting the spin relaxation from an incoherent nonequilibrium state. The basic regimes of collective coherent spin relaxation are studied.

abstract: We study non-equilibrium electronic transport through a quantum dot or impurity weakly coupled to ferromagnetic leads. Based on the rate equation formalism we derive noise spectra for the transport current. We show that due to quantum interference between different spin components of the current the spectrum develops a peak or a dip at the frequency corresponding to Zeeman splitting in the quantum dot. The detailed analysis of the spectral structure of the current is carried out for noninteracting electrons as well as in the regime of Coulomb blockade.

Logarithmic corrections to scaling signal a change in the number of local states accessible to the system as it undergoes the transition.

abstract: A characterization of the two-terminal open-ring Aharonov-Bohm interferometer is made by analyzing the phase space plots in the complex transmission amplitude plane. Two types of plots are considered: type I plot which uses the magnetic flux as the variable parameter and type II plot which uses the electron momentum as the variable parameter. In type I plot, the trajectory closes upon itself only when the ratio $R$ of the arm lengths (of the interferometer) is a rational fraction, the shape and the type of the generated flower-like pattern is sensitive to the electron momentum. For momenta corresponding to discrete eigenstates of the perfect ring (i.e. the ring without the leads), the trajectory passes through the origin a certain fixed number of times before closing upon itself, whereas for arbitrary momenta it never passes through the origin. Although the transmission coefficient is periodic in the flux with the elementary flux quantum as the basic period, the phenomenon of electron transmission is shown not to be so when analyzed via the present technique. The periodicity is seen to spread over several flux units whenever $R$ is a rational fraction whereas there is absolutely no periodicity present when $R$ is an irrational number. In type II plot, closed trajectories passing through the origin a number of times are seen for $R$ being a rational fraction. The case R=1 (i.e. a symmetric ring) with zero flux is rather pathological--it presents a closed loop surrounding the origin. For irrational $R$ values, the trajectories never close.

The joint dynamics of the quantum object and the number of charges transferred through the junction is described by the charge specific density matrix. The method allows evaluating the joint probability distribution of the state of the quantum object and the charge state of the junction.The statistical properties of the junction current are derived from the charge transfer statistics using the master equation for the charge specific density matrix. The theory is applied to a nanoelectromechanical system, and the influence on the average current and the current noise of the junction is obtained for coupling to a harmonic oscillator.

Results of exact time-dependent numerical studies for ladders systems are presented, suggesting generation of RVB states on timescale smaller than typical experimental decoherence times.

abstract: This paper studies quantum Arthur-Merlin games, which are Arthur-Merlin games in which Arthur and Merlin can perform quantum computations and Merlin can send Arthur quantum information. As in the classical case, messages from Arthur to Merlin are restricted to be strings of uniformly generated random bits. It is proved that for one-message quantum Arthur-Merlin games, which correspond to the complexity class QMA, completeness and soundness errors can be reduced exponentially without increasing the length of Merlin's message. Previous constructions for reducing error required a polynomial increase in the length of Merlin's message. Applications of this fact include a proof that logarithmic length quantum certificates yield no increase in power over BQP and a simple proof that QMA is contained in PP. Other facts that are proved include the equivalence of three (or more) message quantum Arthur-Merlin games with ordinary quantum interactive proof systems and some basic properties concerning two-message quantum Arthur-Merlin games.

abstract: We study the fluctuations of the stress tensor for a massless scalar field in two and four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the vacuum state. Covariant expressions for the stress tensor correlation function are obtained as sums of derivatives of a scalar function. These expressions allow one to express spacetime averages of the correlation function as finite integrals. We also study the correlation between measurements of the energy density along a worldline. We find that these measurements may be either positively correlated or anticorrelated. The anticorrelated measurements can be interpreted as telling us that if one measurement yields one sign for the averaged energy density, a successive measurement with a suitable time delay is likely to yield a result with the opposite sign.

abstract: In ``Decoherence of macroscopic closed systems within Newtonian quantum gravity'' (Kay B S 1998 Class.

Here we show that if each uniform-mass ball is replaced by a grainy ball or more general-shaped lump of similar size consisting of a number, n, of well-spaced small balls of mass m and radius r and, in the above formula, R is replaced by r, M by m and the products are taken over all Nn positions of all the small balls, then the result is well-approximated by replacing R in the original formula by a new value R_eff. This suggests that the original formula will apply in general to physically realistic lumps -- be they macroscopic lumps of ordinary matter with the grains atomic nuclei etc. or be they atomic nuclei themselves with their own (quantum) grainy substructure -- provided R is chosen suitably. In the case of a cubical lump consisting of n=(2L+1)^3 small balls (L > 0) of radius r with centres at the vertices of a cubic lattice of spacing a (assumed to be very much bigger than 2r) and side 2La we establish the bound e^{-1/3}(r/a)^{1/n}La < R_eff < 2\sqrt 3(r/a)^{1/n} La.

abstract: Dynamical wave function collapse models entail the continuous liberation of a specified rate of energy arising from the interaction of a fluctuating scalar field with the matter wave function. We consider the wave function collapse process for the constituents of dark matter in our universe. Beginning from a particular early era of the universe chosen from physical considerations, the rate of the associated energy liberation is integrated to yield the requisite magnitude of dark energy around the era of galaxy formation. Further, the equation of state for the liberated energy approaches $w \to -1$ asymptotically, providing a mechanism to generate the present acceleration of the universe.

abstract: Kerr's multi-particle solution is obtained on the base of the Kerr theorem. Choosing generating function of the Kerr theorem $F$ as a product of partial functions $F_i$ for spinning particles i=1,...k, we obtain a multi-sheeted, multi-twistorial space-time over $M^4$ possessing unusual properties. Twistorial structures of the i-th and j-th particles do not feel each other, forming a type of its internal space. Gravitation and electromagnetic interaction of the particles occurs via a singular twistor line which is common for twistorial structures of interacting particles. The obtained multi-particle Kerr-Newman solution turns out to be `dressed' by singular twistor lines linked to surrounding particles. We conjecture that this structure of space-time has the relation to a stringy structure of vacuum and opens a geometrical way to quantum gravity.

abstract: The ground state energy of a boundary quantum field theory is derived in planar geometry in D+1 dimensional spacetime. It provides a universal expression for the Casimir energy which exhibits its dependence on the boundary conditions via the reflection amplitudes of the low energy particle excitations. We demonstrate the easy and straightforward applicability of the general expression by analyzing the free scalar field with Robin boundary condition and by rederiving the most important results available in the literature for this geometry.

abstract: Space-time measurements and gravitational experiments are made by using objects, matter fields or particles and their mutual relationships. As a consequence, any operationally meaningful assertion about space-time is in fact an assertion about the degrees of freedom of the matter (\emph{i.e} non gravitational) fields; those, say for definiteness, of the Standard Model of particle physics. As for any quantum theory, the dynamics of the matter fields can be described in terms of a unitary evolution of a state vector in a Hilbert space. By writing the Hilbert space as a generic tensor product of "subsystems" we analyse the evolution of a state vector on an information theoretical basis and attempt to recover the usual space-time relations from the information exchanges between these subsystems. We consider generic interacting second quantized models with a finite number of fermionic degrees of freedom and characterize on physical grounds the tensor product structure associated with the class of "localized systems" and therefore with "position". We find that in the case of free theories no space-time relation is operationally definable. On the contrary, by applying the same procedure to the simple interacting model of a one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain we recover the tensor product structure usually associated with "position". Finally, we discuss the possible role of gravity in this framework.

abstract: We study in some detail the master equation, and its solution in a simplified case modelling flavour oscillations of a two-level system, stemming from the Liouville-string approach to quantum space time foam. In this framework we discuss the appearance of diffusion terms and decoherence due to the interaction of low-energy string matter with space-time defects, such as D-particles in the specific model of ``D-particle foam'', as well as dark energy contributions. We pay particular attention to contrasting the decoherent role of a cosmological constant in inducing exponential quantum damping in the evolution of low-energy observables, such as the probability of flavour oscillations, with the situation where the dark energy relaxes to zero for asymptotically large times, in which case such a damping is absent. Our findings may be of interest to (astrophysical) tests of quantum space-time foam models in the not-so-distant future.

abstract: In the present article, we review a continual effort on generalization of the Trotter formula to higher-order exponential product formulas. The exponential product formula is a good and useful approximant, particularly because it conserves important symmetries of the system dynamics. We focuse on two algorithms of constructing higher-order exponential product formulas. The first is the fractal decomposition, where we construct higher-order formulas recursively. The second is to make use of the quantum analysis, where we compute higher-order correction terms directly. As interludes, we also have described the decomposition of symplectic integrators, the approximation of time-ordered exponentials, and the perturbational composition.

abstract: The spectra of self-adjoint operators in Krein spaces are known to possess real sectors as well as sectors of pair-wise complex conjugate eigenvalues. Transitions from one spectral sector to the other are a rather generic feature and they usually occur at exceptional points of square root branching type. For certain parameter configurations two or more such exceptional points may happen to coalesce and to form a higher order branch point. We study the coalescence of two square root branch points semi-analytically for a PT-symmetric 4x4 matrix toy model and illustrate numerically its occurrence in the spectrum of the 2x2 operator matrix of the magnetohydrodynamic alpha^2-dynamo and of an extended version of the hydrodynamic Squire equation.

It is shown that if this approximation is taken as unperturbed problem it leads to an extremely fast convergent perturbation theory.

abstract: We consider the compatibility conditions for a N-particle D-dimensional Wigner quantum oscillator. These conditions can be rewritten as certain triple relations involving anticommutators, so it is natural to look for solutions in terms of Lie superalgebras. In the recent classification of ``generalized quantum statistics'' for the basic classical Lie superalgebras [math-ph/0504013], each such statistics is characterized by a set of creation and annihilation operators plus a set of triple relations. In the present letter, we investigate which cases of this classification also lead to solutions of the compatibility conditions. Our analysis yields some known solutions and several classes of new solutions.

abstract: The basic combinatorial properties of a complete set of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) of a q-dimensional Hilbert space H\_q, q = p^r with p being a prime and r a positive integer, are shown to be qualitatively mimicked by the configuration of points lying on a proper conic in a projective Hjelmslev plane defined over a Galois ring of characteristic p^2 and rank r. The q vectors of a basis of H\_q correspond to the q points of a (so-called) neighbour class and the q+1 MUBs answer to the total number of (pairwise disjoint) neighbour classes on the conic.

X-rays of permutation are interesting in the context of Discrete Tomography since many types of integral matrices can be written as linear combinations of permutation matrices. This paper is an invitation to the study of X-rays of permutations from a combinatorial point of view. We present connections between these objects and nondecreasing differences of permutations, zero-sum arrays, decomposable permutations, score sequences of tournaments, queens' problems and rooks' problems.

This newly introduced two-parametric quantum group denoted as $U_{pq}[sl(2)]$ admits a class of infinite-dimensional representations which have no classical (non-deformed) and one-parametric deformation analogues, even at generic deformation parameters. Interestingly that finite-dimensional representations of $U_{pq}[sl(2)]$ allow arbitrary complex "spins" (i.e., not necessary they to be integral or half-integral numbers), unlike those in the classical and one-parametric deformation cases.

abstract: Evolution of quantum fidelity for two-level systems is studied in the context of periodic echo. From a general treatment for time independent case, we obtain a simple condition on the governing Hamiltonians under which the systems display periodic quantum echo. For a specific time dependent problem the quantum fidelity is shown to exhibit Rabi oscillation. This may be considered as a simple mechanism to generate periodic echo, except for a specific initial superpositional state in which case the fidelity remains invariant.

abstract: In order to use a collection of trapped ions for experiments where a well defined preparation of vibrational states is necessary, all vibrational modes have to be cooled to ensure precise and repeatable manipulation of the ions' quantum states. A method for simultaneous sideband cooling of all axial vibrational modes is proposed. By application of a magnetic field gradient the absorption spectrum of each ion is modified such that sideband resonances of different vibrational modes coincide. The ion string is then irradiated with monochromatic electromagnetic radiation, in the optical or microwave regime, for sideband excitation. This cooling scheme is investigated in detailed numerical studies. Its application for initializing ion strings for quantum information processing is extensively discussed.

abstract: Fiber taper waveguides are used to improve the efficiency of room temperature photoluminescence measurements of AlGaAs microdisk resonant cavities with embedded self-assembled InAs quantum dots. As a near-field collection optic, the fiber taper improves the collection efficiency from microdisk lasers by a factor of ~ 15-100 times in comparison to conventional normal incidence free-space collection techniques. In addition, the fiber taper can serve as a efficient means for pumping these devices, and initial measurements employing fiber pumping and collection are presented. Implications of this work towards chip-based cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments are discussed.

abstract: We study the dynamics of the cooling of a gas of caesium atoms in an optical lattice, both experimentally and with 1D full-quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that, contrary to the standard interpretation of the Sisyphus model, the cooling process does not work by a continuous decrease of the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the lattice. Instead, we show that the momentum of the atoms follows a bimodal distribution, the atoms being gradually transferred from a hot to a cold mode. We suggest that the cooling mechanism should be depicted in terms of a rate model, describing the transfer between the two modes along with the processes occurring within each mode.

abstract: We study the control by electromagnetic fields of molecular alignment and orientation, in a linear, rigid rotor model. With the help of a monotonically convergent algorithm, we find that the optimal field is in the microwave part of the spectrum and acts by resonantly exciting the rotation of the molecule progressively from the ground state, i.e., by rotational ladder climbing. This mechanism is present not only when maximizing orientation or alignment, but also when using prescribed target states that simultaneously optimize the efficiency of orientation/alignment and its duration. The extension of the optimization method to consider a finite rotational temperature is also presented.

However, with three or more particles, contradictions emerge even for perfect correlations. We describe an experiment which can be realized in the laboratory, using four-photon entangled states generated by parametric down-conversion, to demonstrate this contradiction at the level of perfect correlations.
